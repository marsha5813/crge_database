She arrived in China in 1938 and served for 12 years in Shaanxi Province. After leaving China in August 1951 and returning to Norway, she remained committed to missionary work among Chinese communities. In 1952, the Mission Covenant Church of Norway initially rejected her application to return to the Far East due to concerns about limited opportunities in Taiwan and Hong Kong, recommending Africa instead. After negotiations, the church agreed to provide only a monthly stipend without additional funding.  \n\n\nIn 1953, Berntsen arrived in Hong Kong and joined missionary Hanny Grønlund to work with refugees in Rennie’s Mill (調景嶺), establishing the Rennie’s Mill Church Clinic Committee. She later founded a tuberculosis sanatorium, \"Haven of Hope Sanatorium,\" in 1955. The name \"Haven of Hope\" is derived from the Bible, symbolizing the fruits of the Holy Spirit. The same year, a nursing school was established, marking a new era in healthcare development for the community.  \n\n\nIn 1961, the Haven of Hope Chapel was inaugurated, and the Grace Home for Children was established to care for the children of tuberculosis patients. In 1975, the Grace Home expanded its services to severely intellectually disabled children and became fully supported by the Education Department in 1981, transforming into the Grace School and Children's Home. In 1976, the Haven of Hope Sanatorium was renamed Haven of Hope Hospital. By 1990, the Tseung Kwan O District Aid Association was renamed the Christian Haven of Hope Association.  \n\n\nBerntsen retired in 1978 and returned to Norway, where she was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1979.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) William Newbern (劉福群)  \n\n(References: 梁家麟1999: 95-96; 何明章2021: 282-285)  \n\n\nWilliam Newbern (1900–1972) was born into a Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA) family in the United States. He began his missionary service in Guangxi, China, in 1922, was ordained in 1923, and returned to the U.S. between 1925 and 1928 due to political unrest. He returned to China in 1929 and served as principal of Wuzhou Bible Seminary from 1936 to 1944 and again after its reopening in 1946.  \n\n\nAs the political situation in South China deteriorated, the C&MA instructed missionaries in Guangxi to retreat to Hong Kong. In 1949, Newbern proposed reopening the Wuzhou Bible Seminary in Hong Kong despite plans to redeploy missionaries elsewhere. His persistence led to the establishment of the seminary in Hong Kong, initially housed in missionary Robert A. Jaffray's villa on Cheung Chau Island.  \n\n\nThe seminary became a foundation for building C&MA churches across Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. In 1955, the seminary was renamed the Alliance Bible Seminary. Beyond theological education, Newbern promoted sacred music, compiling hymnals like Youth Hymns and organizing annual music concerts at the seminary, which became significant events in Hong Kong's Christian community.  \n\n\nNewbern served as the Field Director of the Hong Kong C&MA Mission from 1954 to 1958, overseeing initiatives such as the \"Five-Year Self-Support Plan\" and forming the Hong Kong Alliance Churches Union in 1959. These efforts marked a step towards local church autonomy.  \n\n\nHe retired in 1968 and returned to the U.S., where he passed away in 1972. His memoir, The Cross and the Crown: My View of the Alliance Bible Seminary, was published posthumously in 1973 and later translated into Chinese in 1976.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Bishop Ralph A. Ward (黃安素)  \n\n(References: 林崇智2015: 111-116; 邢福增2024b)  \n\n\nRalph A. Ward (1882–1958) was born on June 26, 1882, in Ohio, USA. In 1909, he began missionary work in the Fuzhou District under the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was elected Bishop of the West China Conference in 1937 and became Bishop of the Methodist Church in 1941, overseeing the Jiangxi, Central China, and East China Conferences after the church’s unification in 1939.  \n\n\nDuring World War II, Ward was interned in a concentration camp for three and a half years. After leaving China in late 1950, he passed through Hong Kong and was struck by the plight of Chinese refugees.  \n\n\nAlthough he retired in 1952 at the age of 70, Ward was reappointed to oversee ministry to Chinese refugees in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In a 1952 memorandum, Our Continuing Church Among the Chinese People, Ward articulated his vision for serving the 20 million Chinese living outside mainland China, particularly in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  \n\n\nMany Methodist refugees from Shanghai and Fujian struggled to adapt to Cantonese-speaking churches in Hong Kong. Ward and Dr. Sidney R. Anderson established Methodist congregations in North Point (1953) and Yau Ma Tei (1955) to serve these refugees. These churches became a vital continuation of Methodist ministry, providing pastoral care to war-displaced individuals.  \n\n\nBetween 1952 and 1954, Ward reorganized Methodist congregations in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, and Hong Kong. In 1956, he founded the \"Taiwan-Hong Kong Provisional Annual Conference,\" serving as its presiding bishop. Ward passed away in Hong Kong on December 11, 1958, at the age of 76.\n\n(1)司務道 Annie Skau Berntsen（司務道1985；劉義章2005）\n\n\n司務道（Annie Skau Berntsen, 1911-1992），挪威聖約差會（Mission Covenant Church）傳教士，1938年抵中國，於陝西傳教達12年之久。1951年8月離開中國回到挪威後，仍心擊華人宣教。挪威聖約差會因憂慮台灣、香港等地傳福音的機會不多，在1952年拒絕司務道再到遠東的申請，建議她轉到非洲中、南部。惟經多次商討後，差會答允除每月供給生活費外，不支付任何經費。司氏於1953年抵香港後，即與挪威聖約差會傳教士葛瑞霖（Hanny Grønlund）會合，投身調景嶺的難民工作，成立「調景嶺基督教醫務所委員會」（The Rennie’s Mill Church Clinic Committee）。後成立肺病療養院，於1955年奠基及開幕，取名「靈實肺病療養院」；靈實出自聖經，是指聖靈所結的果子。同年，護士學校成立，為靈實以至社區開創醫療發展新里程。\n\n\n1961年，靈實禮拜堂落成。同年，恩光護幼會成立，照顧肺病病人的子女。1975年，恩光護幼院擴大照顧範圍加設嚴重弱智兒童服務部，其後在1981年獲教育署全面資助，發展成一所嚴重智障兒童寄宿學校，並改名為恩光學校暨兒童院。1976年，靈實肺病療養院改名為靈實醫院。1990年，將軍澳區醫援會改名為基督教靈實協會。\n\n\n司務道於1978年退休，回到挪威。1979年  獲英女皇頒授大英帝國官佐勳章(OBE)。\n\n\n(2) 劉福群 William Newbern（梁家麟 1999：95-96；何明章2021：282-285）\n\n\n劉福群（William Newbern, 1900-1972），1900年生於美國宣道會家庭。1922年奉宣道會（Christian and Missionary Alliance）派到中國廣西宣教，1923年被按立，1925至28年間因政治形勢動盪返美，1929年重返中國。1936至44年間，任梧州建道聖經學院院長。1946年復校後，再任院長。差會在華南解放前夕吩咐在廣西的全部傳教士撤至香港，並於1949年7月在香港召開差會會議。當時差會擬將傳教士轉派至東南亞其他工場，但劉福群卻建議留守香港，並尋索在港重開梧州建道聖經學院的可能。\n\n\n1950年8月，宣道會在港召開特別會議，包忠傑（Paul H. Bartel）、丁惠民（August F. Desterhaft）等差會負責同工與華會的沙毅、趙柳塘等均有出席。會議正式議決在香港復校一年，讓畢業班的同學能完成學業。後來，宣道會海外部總幹事施爾德（A. C. Snead）認為中共將在短期內接管香港，遠東的宣教工作，在五年內便會結束，不同意再在港投放太多資源。但劉福群卻不同意他的見解，認為聖經學院應在港繼續維持。因著劉福群的堅持，建道聖經學院得以在香港續辦，以傳教士翟輔民（Robert A. Jaffray）在長洲島的別墅作為校舍。宣道會原在香港沒有事工，在畢業生的努力開荒下，在港九新界各地建立宣道會堂會。1955年，建道聖經學院改名建道神學院。\n\n\n除神學教育外，劉福群在推廣聖樂方面，亦不遺餘力。除參與《宣道詩》的編譯外，他又主編中英對照的《青年聖詩》，希望可以成為一本不分宗派的詩集。他又在建道舉辨聖樂演唱會，成為該院及香港教會界的年度盛事。\n\n\n1954至1958年間，劉福群任香港宣道會西差會主席（Field Director）。1956年，西差會通過香港本地教會推行「五年自養計劃」，並籌劃各堂代表組成本地聯會。1957年，成立「基督教中華宣道會香港區主任會」，1959年成立「宣道會香港堂聯會」，標誌著本地華人走上自治之路。\n\n\n1968年，劉卸下建道院長一職，被任命為榮譽院長。退休後回到美國，1972年安息。著有《十架與冠冕》（The Cross and the Crown: My View of the Alliance Bible Seminary），1973年出版後，1976年譯成中文。\n\n\n(3) 黃安素 Ralph A. Ward（林崇智2015：111-116；邢福增2024b）\n\n\n黃安素（Bishop Ralph A. Ward, 1882-1958），1882年6月26日生於美國俄亥俄州。1909年，他奉美以美會（Methodist Episcopal Church）派到中國福州教區傳教。1937年，獲選為美以美會駐華西區會督。1939年，在華美以美會、監理會（Methodist Episcopal Mission, South）及美普會（Methodist Protestant Mission）合併為衛理公會後，黃安素於1941年獲選為衛理公會會督，監督江西、華中及華東年議會。太平洋戰爭爆發後，黃安素被拘禁於集中營達三年半之久。1950年11月下旬離開中國，取道香港時，目睹大量來自中國的難民，離散漂泊，群羊乏牧。\n\n\n1952年，黃安素以70高齡退休。但他再獲會督總會（Council of Bishops）重新委任，以監督在香港及台灣開展服事中國難民的工作。他在1952年4月一篇題為「我們在華人中的教會將會繼續」（ Our Continuing Church Among the Chinese People）的備忘中闡述其異象，就是在中國境內教會與外界完全隔絕的時候，如何面對居於中國大陸以外的2000萬華人所帶來的挑戰和機遇，特別是在香港及台灣的華人。\n\n\n當時不少自上海及福建避秦南下的衛理信徒，在語言上不諳粵語，無法適應香港的教會生活。他與自上海抵港的安迪生（Sidney R. Anderson）博士決定開設衛理公會。他邀請衛理公會在四十年代派送至美國進修的周郁晞及楊震來港，負責帶領港島北角（北角衛理堂，1953）及九龍油麻地（九龍衛理公會，1955）的事工。兩所堂會的建立，不僅是服事戰亂中顛簸南逃的離散者，讓他們在香港繼續得到適切牧養，也是衛理公會在華事工中黜後，在香港延續福音使命的肇始。1952至54年間，黃安素帶領衛理公會教友在台北、台中、台南及香港等地重新組織起來，並於1956年成立「台灣－香港臨時年議會」，由他任駐區會督。1958年12月11日，黃安素會督在香港因病離世，享年76歲。\n\n (4) Karl L. Stumpf (施同福)  \n\n(References: 胡建斌2024: 107-111)  \n\n\nKarl L. Stumpf (1913–1987) was born in Germany and arrived in Shanghai in 1937, working at a German pharmaceutical company established by Jewish immigrants. During the war, as large numbers of Jews fled to Shanghai, he began a ministry to support Jewish Christians. After the war, he was ordained as a pastor by the Lutheran Church to serve German expatriates in Shanghai and worked at the Shanghai Lutheran Center.  \n\n\nIn January 1952, Stumpf relocated to Hong Kong, where he was appointed Director of the Hong Kong Office of the World Council of Churches (WCC) Refugee Service. In 1954, he became Director of the Hong Kong branch of the Lutheran World Federation’s World Services (LWS), which had been providing services in Hong Kong since 1952.  \n\n\nStumpf was deeply concerned about refugee issues in Hong Kong. While most relief organizations focused on Chinese refugees, the LWS identified stateless foreigners, primarily White Russians and Jews, who urgently required assistance. Together with the WCC Refugee Service, the LWS established the Joint Service to Refugees, assisting 6,000 applicants within its first two months. Over two years, 3,267 foreign refugees secured visas to Western countries, but over 10,000 cases remained unresolved.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, under Stumpf’s leadership, the Lutheran Social Service also aided Chinese refugees in Hong Kong by providing emergency relief such as cash, food, and clothing. In the 1960s, the LWS built several \"Lutheran Villages\" in Hong Kong's New Territories (e.g., Ma On Shan, Ma Tso Lung, Tsing Yi, Tap Mun, and Cheung Chau), funded primarily through donations from Lutheran churches in Europe and North America.  \n\n\nIn 1973, the LWS headquarters in Geneva re-evaluated its priorities, deciding to merge the Lutheran Social Service with the Hong Kong Christian Welfare Council in 1976, forming the Hong Kong Christian Service. Stumpf continued as its Director until retiring in 1979, after which he served as an advisor. During his tenure, he initiated pioneering services, including special education, vocational training, school social work, foster care, elderly homes, halfway houses for drug addicts, and community services.  \n\n\nAfter the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Stumpf extended his work to aid Vietnamese refugees, establishing the Hong Kong Christian Aid to Refugees (renamed Christian Action in 1994). Between 1977 and 1987, he also served as Chairman of the Hong Kong Society for the Blind and held key positions in the Hong Kong Council of Social Service and other welfare organizations.  \n\n\nIn recognition of his significant contributions to post-war relief, refugee aid, and social welfare in Hong Kong, Stumpf was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1966 and the Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 1981. He passed away in Hong Kong in May 1987.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) S. C. Leung (梁小初)  \n\n(References: 容慧雯2023)  \n\n\nS. C. Leung (1889–1968) was born in Foshan, Guangdong. In 1900, he attended the London Missionary Society’s To Chi School in Guangzhou and was baptized in 1903 at the London Missionary Society Church (later the Chinese Congregational Church Wai Oi Church).  \n\n\nIn 1907, Leung interned at the National Committee of the YMCA in Shanghai and returned to Guangzhou in 1909 as a YMCA Secretary. In 1913, he studied at the YMCA College in Chicago and returned to China in 1914. By 1920, he was the General Secretary of the Guangzhou YMCA. From 1926 to 1929, he pursued further studies in the U.S., earning degrees in literature, economics, and education.  \n\n\nUpon returning to China, Leung served as Deputy General Secretary and then Acting General Secretary of the National Committee of the YMCA. From 1935 to 1948, he was its official General Secretary.  \n\n\nAfter retiring in 1948, Leung moved to Hong Kong, where he became Executive Secretary and later Deputy Secretary for Asia at the WCC. He also chaired the Hong Kong Chinese YMCA, served as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Chung Chi College, and was involved with the Hong Kong Christian Council.  \n\n\nIn 1951, during the Christian Accusation Movement in China, Leung was a target of criticism.  \n\n\nLeung joined the Chinese Congregational Church in Hong Kong and served as a deacon and Executive Committee Chair of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China. In 1967, he suffered a stroke and passed away in January 1968. His unfinished memoir, An Unfinished Autobiography – The 77 Memoirs, was posthumously published in 1969.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) Peng Fu (彭福)  \n\n(References: 查時傑1983: 197-206; 胡建斌2024: 123-126; 天風1951: 6)  \n\n\nPeng Fu (1888–1975), born in Runan, Henan, was baptized in 1903 after attending a school established by K. S. Stokke, a missionary of the Lutheran United Mission. He pursued theological studies at Griffith John College in Hankou and later at a seminary in Laoshan.  \n\n\nIn 1916, Peng graduated from the Lutheran Seminary in Hubei and served in the Runan church. He was ordained in 1928 and became Supervisor of the Henan-Hubei Synod in 1930, and later General Supervisor of the Lutheran Church of China in 1937.  \n\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, Peng led the seminary’s relocation to Chongqing and resumed his role as General Supervisor in 1946. In 1949, he chaired the 27th General Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China in Hong Kong and proposed establishing a Mandarin-speaking congregation for refugees.  \n\n\nIn 1951, after severing ties with \"imperialist\" influences, Peng was dismissed as General Supervisor.  \n\n\nIn 1954, Peng helped establish the Hong Kong Lutheran Church and became its first Supervisor. Under his leadership, the church expanded its refugee services and built schools and churches. By the early 1960s, the Hong Kong Lutheran Church had grown to 30 congregations with over 10,000 members.  \n\n\nPeng passed away in 1975 due to heart disease at the age of 88.  \n\n（4）施同福 Karl L. Stumpf（胡建斌2024：107-111）\n\n\n施同福（Karl L. Stumpf, 1913-1987），生於德國，1937年抵上海，於猶太人開辦的德國藥廠工作。戰時大量猶太人湧入上海，他展開救援猶太裔基督徒事工。戰後為便利牧養在滬德國僑民，被信義會按立為牧師，並在上海信義中心工作。1952年1月自滬抵港，被普世教會協會難民服務處（W.C.C. Refugee Service）主任E. H. S. Chandler委任為香港辦事處主任。1954年，任世界信義宗的世界服務部（Lutheran World Federation/ World Services，簡稱Lutheran World Services）香港分部主任。該處總部設於日內瓦，自1952年開始在香港提供服務。\n\n\n施同福高度關注香港難民問題。當時大多救濟組織把重點放在從中國逃至香港的中國難民身上，但世界服務部卻發現有不少流落香港的無國籍外國人，其中以白俄羅斯人及猶太人為主，急須協助。於是，世界信義宗與普世教會協會難民服務處（World Council of Churches Refugee Service）成立聯合機構──難民聯合服務（Joint Service to Refugees），協助外國難民。在最初兩個月，即有6,000人申請協助。兩年後，共有3267名外國難民成功獲得西方國家的簽證，但仍有一萬多人的申請尚無著落。\n\n\n與此同時，在施同福帶領下，信義宗社會服務處又積極幫助湧入香港的中國難民。五十年代，主要以提供緊急物質救援為主，包括供應金錢、食物及衣物，以解決難民燃眉之急，同時又開展醫療服務及房屋供應。其中在六十年代於香港新界各地，興建多條信義村（馬鞍山、馬草壟、青衣、塔門、長洲）。其經費來源，主要是從歐美各地的信義宗教會募捐。\n\n\n1973年，世界信義宗設於日內瓦的總部覺得香港已不是發展計劃中的重要區域，決定調整對香港政策，自1976年1月1日起，世界信義宗社會服務處與「香港基督教服務委員會」合併，易名為「香港基督教服務處」，施同福續任基督教服務處主任，至1979年退休，轉任顧問。擔任主任期間，他仍開創了多項倡導性服務，如特殊學校、職業訓練、學校社會工作、寄養服務、老人宿舍、戒毒者中途宿舍、鄰舍層面的社區服務。\n\n\n1975年越戰結束後，越南難（船）民湧至香港，施同福延續其服務難民的工作，成立香港基督教難民服務處（Hong Kong Christian Aid to Refugees，1994年易名基督教勵行會，Christian Action）。1977至1987年間任職香港盲人輔導會會長。同時，他對香港社會福利事業亦有長期承擔，歷任香港社會服務聯會正、副主席，及社會福利諮詢委員會委員。因應施氏對戰後香港社會救濟及福利，以至難民救援工作，作出重要貢獻。1966年獲頒英帝國官佐勳章（Officer of the British Empire, OBE），1981年獲頒受英帝國司令勳章（Commander of the British Empire, CBE）。\n\n\n1987年5月於香港病逝。\n\n\n（5）梁小初 S.

Originally part of the Swedish American Mission (renamed the Chinese Christian Evangelistic Association in 1931), Wong attended its Daguang Primary School. In 1926, his family moved to Hong Kong, where he joined the Assemblies of God Church. After graduating from Ying Wa College in 1933, he attended Union Theological College in Guangzhou, graduating in 1937. He then pursued advanced studies in religious education at Oberlin College in the U.S., earning a Master of Arts in Theology in 1940 before returning to China.  \n\n\nAfter Guangzhou fell in 1938, the Guangdong Association of the Church of Christ in China relocated to Hong Kong. Upon Wong's return, he served as the Executive Secretary of the Guangdong Association and led youth patriotism campaigns. On October 30, 1940, at the age of 25, he was ordained as a pastor. Shortly afterward, when Hong Kong fell to Japanese forces in December 1941, the association relocated to Zhanjiang and later to Qujiang. After World War II, it returned to Guangzhou, and Wong became its General Secretary in 1947. He was also appointed pastor of Renji Church and received an honorary doctorate (L.H.D.) from Otterbein University that same year.  \n\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wong signed a pledge to support the Three-Self Patriotic Movement on behalf of the Guangdong Association. However, he stepped down as General Secretary in 1951 and focused on pastoring Renji Church. In 1956, under the guise of visiting relatives, Wong moved to Hong Kong permanently, later describing the move as a pursuit of freedom to serve the Lord.  \n\n\nIn 1957, Wong was appointed Executive Secretary of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China (CCC-HK), a position he held for 26 years until 1984. Under his leadership, the council revised its constitution, implemented a ten-year self-support plan, and achieved full financial and administrative independence in 1974. During his tenure, Wong initiated multiple evangelistic campaigns, founded nine churches, and significantly expanded the council’s educational mission, overseeing the operation of numerous schools. By 1982, the council managed 16 secondary schools, 6 affiliated secondary schools, 3 industrial schools, 5 night schools, and 37 primary schools, becoming a leading educational body in Hong Kong.

Its origins date back to the Guangzhou Bible Conference, which began in 1927. Starting in 1928, the conference was held annually in Guangzhou in July and then moved to Hong Kong in August. The event was suspended during the Second Sino-Japanese War but resumed in 1946. The final conference held in mainland China took place in Guangzhou in August 1949, and from 1950 onward, the event was relocated to Hong Kong, renamed the \"Hong Kong Bible Conference.\"\n\n\nThe conference includes Bible study sessions and revival meetings. During the 1950s, the speakers were evenly divided between Western missionaries and Chinese pastors. Notable Western speakers included Charles L. Culpepper (Baptist), Norman Nelson, William C. Newbren (Christian and Missionary Alliance), Charles Roberts (Hunan Bible Institute), Paul H. Bartel (Christian and Missionary Alliance), R. W. Frame (China Inland Mission), David Adeney (China Inland Mission), Gladys Ward, Ruth Hitchcock (Hebron Mission), and Gordon Dunn (China Inland Mission). Prominent Chinese speakers included Chou Chi Yu (China Evangelistic Mission), Timothy T. Ting, Pang Fook (Lutheran Church), Yang Chun Zhe (Alliance Bible Seminary), Wong Zhi (Christian and Missionary Alliance), Qi En Lian (Lutheran Church), Xu Song Shi (Baptist Church), Xie You Wang (Hunan Bible Institute), Chang Jung Chiang (Baptist Church), Zeng Lin Fang (Bethel Theological Seminary), Yu Li Gong (Chinese Christian Students Union), Chou Yu Xi (Methodist Church), and Yeh Pak Nam.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Revival of Baptist Youth Fellowships (Chan Hoi Him, 2015: 18-26; Xing Fuzeng, 2004: 166-167)\n\n\nIn the 1950s, figures influenced by the evangelical revival tradition, such as Zhao Junying, John Chen, and Zheng Guo, came to Hong Kong, along with local leaders like Hu En De of the Joyful Gospel Hall. They were invited to lead various revival meetings, sparking a wave of spiritual renewal among young believers. \n\n\nOne notable event was the Baptist Youth Fellowship summer camp held on Cheung Chau Island in 1951. Led by Hu En De and Zhao Junying, the camp drew over 80 participants. According to Hu En De, on the final evening, \"many young people were enlightened before the Lord, confessed their sins, and prayed throughout the night.\" These youths experienced significant transformations in their lives, emphasizing:  \n\n1. The doctrine of being born again,  \n\n2. Pursuing a holy life,  \n\n3. Studying and learning from the Bible,  \n\n4. Enthusiastically sharing the gospel, and  \n\n5. Actively serving in the church.\n\n\nParticipant Chan Hoi Him recalled tearful prayers and a deep conviction from the Holy Spirit, leading them to repent and even write letters to their parents confessing their sins. After the camp, the revival fire continued as participants shared their experiences with others who had not attended. \n\n\nYouth fellowship leaders organized a three-day non-residential retreat at various Baptist churches, including Caine Road Baptist Church, Kowloon City Baptist Church, and Tsim Sha Tsui Baptist Church. Additionally, they launched a \"100,000 Tracts Campaign,\" distributing gospel tracts across Hong Kong in a single day. These annual summer camps became a hallmark of revival for the Baptist Youth Fellowship, though tensions later arose between the fellowship and the Baptist Convention, leading to movements like the Gospel Hall Movement in the 1960s.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Bishop Hall’s Visit to China, 1956 (Ng Ching, 2017: 142-154; Chan-Yeung, 2015: 134-142)\n\n\nFrom May 30 to June 24, 1956, Bishop R. O. Hall of the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau visited China, becoming the first Hong Kong church leader to visit China after the establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949. This visit attracted widespread attention, as the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in China aimed to sever ties between Christianity and imperialism.\n\n\nThe visit occurred during China's \"Hundred Flowers Campaign,\" which fostered a relatively open environment, allowing exchanges between Chinese and Western churches. Bishop Hall met with clergy from the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui and visited Anglican churches in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. Notably, he attended the opening ceremony of the third session of the First National People’s Congress and was received and hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai.\n\n\nAfter his visit, Bishop Hall published an article titled The Church in the New China: Social Evils have Disappeared in the Revolution, praising the changes brought by the revolution and claiming that the church had not been harmed. His favorable view of communist China earned him the nickname \"Pink Bishop\" in Hong Kong media.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) Billy Graham Crusades, 1956 (SCMP, 1956; Overseas Chinese Daily News, 1956 a, b, c, d)\n\n\nIn February 1956, renowned American evangelist Billy Graham held his first crusade in Hong Kong as part of his Far East tour, which also included stops in the Philippines, India, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. His visit to Hong Kong lasted from February 13 to 16. A 25-member committee, comprising representatives from various denominations and organizations, was formed to organize the event, symbolizing unprecedented cooperation among Christian groups in Hong Kong.\n\n\nDuring his stay, Graham met with church leaders, theological seminary students, and Bible college students at Pui Ching Middle School. A mass choir of over 1,000 singers and an equal number of volunteers participated in the crusade, marking a first in Hong Kong's Christian history. \n\n\nOn February 15, Graham led an outdoor evangelistic rally attended by approximately 40,000 people at the South China Athletic Association Stadium and Government Stadium. Around 4,000 people responded to the altar call. Special late-night train services were arranged to accommodate attendees.\n\n\nBilly Graham returned to Hong Kong for crusades in 1975 and 1990. In 1990, Hong Kong Baptist College awarded him an honorary doctorate.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Christian Civic Movement, 1956 (Ni Kam Fai, 1966)\n\n\nUnder the leadership of Bishop R. O. Hall, the Hong Kong Christian Council’s Executive Committee established the \"Christian Civic Movement Subcommittee\" in 1956. The movement aimed to:  \n\n1. Promote research on social issues and Christian responses,  \n\n2. Enhance civic responsibility in daily life, and  \n\n3. Encourage churches and Christian organizations to unite in opposing societal evils.\n\n\nThe movement emphasized the need for Christians to lead ethical lives within their communities, hoping to inspire broader civic awareness among the general population. \n\n\nIn 1957, the council distributed leaflets titled The Responsibility of Christians Towards Society to 89 churches and organizations, organized speech and essay contests in Christian schools, and advocated for Civic Awareness Weeks in Christian youth fellowships. Collaborating with Radio Rediffusion, the council produced programs on civic issues featuring religious leaders.\n\n\nSubsequent activities included a \"Good Citizen\" photography contest in 1961, with 100 winning entries displayed at City Hall, and the publication of a 64-panel Good Citizen comic collection in 1962. In 1965, July was designated \"Christian Civic Sunday\" for promoting civic teachings in churches.\n\n\nThe committee also voiced opinions on societal issues, including opposition to legalized soccer gambling (1959), campaigns against legalizing off-track horse betting (1964), resisting the expansion of bars in Kowloon (1966), and advocating for anti-drug campaigns (1966).\n\n(1) 港九培靈研經會 Hong Kong Bible Conference, 1950 (李金強、黃彩蓮2019：180-197)\n\n\n港九培靈研經會是香港教會的盛事，迄今仍每年舉行。其起源可追溯至1927年開始的廣州「培靈研經大會」，從1928年起每年7月在廣州舉行，到8月便移師香港。抗戰期間因戰亂停辦，至1946年復員後復會。1949年8月於廣州為在中國大陸舉行的最後一屆，1950年起在香港復辦，易名「港九培靈研經會」。\n\n\n培靈研經會包括研經會、培靈（奮興）會，五十年代應邀領會者西教士及華人各半，其中西教士包括：柯理培（Charles L. Culpepper，浸信會）、納爾遜（Norman Nelson）、劉福群（William C. Newbren，宣道會）、饒培德（Charles Roberts，湖南聖經學校）、包忠傑（Paul H. Bartel，宣道會）、費述凱（R. W. Frame，內地會）、艾德理（David Adeney，內地會）、汪長仁（Gladys Ward，）、何義思（Ruth Hitchcock，希伯崙會）、鄧普華（Gordon Dunn，內地會）等。華人講員則有：周志禹（中華傳道會）、滕近輝、彭福（信義會）、楊濬哲（建道聖經學院）、王峙（宣道會）、齊恩廉（信義會）、徐松石（浸信會）、謝友王（湖南聖經學校）、張容江（浸信會）、曾霖芳（伯特利神學院）、于力工（中國基督徒學生聯合會）、周郁晞（衛理公會）、葉伯南。\n\n\n(2) 浸信會少年團聯會復興（陳喜謙2015：18-26；邢福增2004：166-167）\n\n\n五十年代後，好些深受奮興佈道傳統影響的人士，例如趙君影、陳約翰、鄭果等相繼來港，加上本地喜樂福音堂的胡恩德，他們應邀主領不同令會，在部分青少年信徒間，掀起一陣復興之風。其中1951年浸信會少年團在長洲的聯合夏令會，成為五十年代浸信會少年團契復興之火的肇始。是次夏令會由胡恩德及趙君影主講，有80多人參加，據胡恩德指出，在最後一晚，「有不少青年人在主前蒙光照，認罪悔改，整夜禱告」。這群青年人「蒙恩」後，在生活上有了重大的改變：（一）著重重生道理；（二）追求聖潔生活；（三）努力在主的話上學習，研讀聖經；（四）熱心傳揚福音；（五）熱心參與教會事奉。其中一位參加者陳喜謙憶述，各人流淚禱告，並深受聖靈感動及催迫認罪悔改。這些少年人為罪自責，彼此認罪，也寫信回家向父母認罪。夏令會後，復興之火仍在各人心中燃點，把在營中的感動與領受，各未有參加夏令會的團友分享。有少年團聯會的負責弟兄姊妹，決定舉行一連三日的非住宿退會，分別在士他令道浸信會、堅道浸信會及尖沙咀浸信會舉行。此外，團友又發起「十萬單張運動」，分隊到各區派發福音單張，一天內派發了十萬張單張。自此，浸信會少年團聯會每年的夏令會，參加者都經歷復興。不過，這也伏下少年團聯會與浸信會聯會間的矛盾與張力及六十年代初福音堂運動的出現（參1960年代「福音堂運動」）。\n\n\n(3) 何明華會督訪問中國 1956（吳青2017：142-154；Chan-Yeung 2015: 134-142）\n\n\n1956年5月30日至6月24日，聖公會港澳教區主教何明華（ Bishop Hall）訪問中國，成為1949年中共建國後，首位訪問中國的香港教會領袖。自五十年代起，中國基督教開展以割斷基督教與帝國主義關係為目標的三自革新（愛國）運動，作為在殖民地香港的英國傳教士，是次訪華行程自然受到廣泛關注。\n\n\n何氏訪華的時間，正值中國處於「百花齊放，百家爭鳴」的寬鬆處境，中國教會恢復與西方教會的交流。在行程中，他除了與中華聖公會的教牧見外，又到訪廣州、上海、南京、北京的聖公會。更特別的是，他獲邀旁聽第一屆全國人民代表大會第三次會議的開幕式，並受中國總理周恩來接見及宴請。\n\n\n訪問結束後，何明華發表了 “The Church in the New China: Social Evils have Disappeared in the Revolution” 一文，高度讚揚革命後的新中國，並指教會並未受到破壞。由於他對紅色中國的肯定，因此香港報刊有稱他為「粉紅色主教」（Pink Bishop）。\n\n\n(4) 葛培理香港佈道大會 Billy Graham Crusades, 1956（SCMP 1956；華僑日報1956 a,b,c,d）\n\n\n美國著名佈道家葛培理（Billy Graham）於1956年2月首次在香港主領大佈道會，此行為葛遠東巡迴佈道之旅，行程包括菲律賓、印度、日本、台灣、韓國等地，訪港日期為2月13至16日。為籌備是次佈道會，香港教會人士成立了廿五人籌備委員會，包括張有光（主席）、林子豐、黃作、李貞明、彭福、李求思、劉粵聲、彭紹賢、陳翼堅、楊濬哲、貝光道、劉福群等，涉及各宗派及男女青年會等團體，被視為「中西各基督團體從來未有之大合作」。葛培理訪港期間，除主領2月15日晚公開露天佈道會外，於當日上午會跟各教會人士、神學院、聖經學院師生等在培正中學一聚。\n\n\n香港眾教會，又組成千人的聯合詩班，在佈道會上合唱，同時又組成千多人的義工，也是香港基督教史上首次。\n\n\n葛氏抵港當日，談及「本人非一政治家，而僅為人類為上帝服務」，又解釋基督徒與馬克斯主義者的分別在於，基督徒認為「每一個人除肉體外，尚有靈魂，即吾人從內心修養，達至心境清潔無邪，則所造之事，祗有博愛和平，世界上之一切戰爭糾紛，即可戳止。」相反，馬克斯主義唯物論，則帶「世界上之若干憎恨與仇視」。他又形容「香港為世界上最美城市之一，為因香港目下所處之環境，彼希望其能成為亞洲靈性復興之出發點」。\n\n當晚佈道會約有4萬人出席，濟滿南華會球場及政府大球場，並有4000人回應呼召決志相信。當晚九廣鐵路更特別加開夜班火車。\n\n\n其後，葛培理於1975及1990年，亦親臨香港主領大型佈道會。1990年時香港浸會學院頒發榮譽博士學位予。\n\n\n(5) 基督教公民運動 1956（倪鑑輝1966）\n\n\n1956年，在何明華主教推動下，香港基督教協進會常務委員會通過成立「基督教公民運動小組委員會」（下稱委員會），運動的目標包括：（1）促進社會問題的研究，和基督教信仰對這些問題所能給予的解答；（2）增進市民在日常生活中的責任感；（3）鼓勵眾教會及教會機構與信徒間的聯合行動，以反抗社會罪惡」。整個運動深信基督教信仰必須引導信徒在社區中過良好的倫理和道德生活，期望先在基督徒中間開始工作，再逐步推廣，使市民對公社的責任有新的醒覺。\n\n\n翌年，協進會印製「基督徒對社會的責任」單張，分派予89間教會及機構。委員會又在基督教中學舉辨演講及論文比賽，並倡議基督教中學及教會青年團契推行公民運動週。同時，又與麗的呼聲電台作作，邀請宗教領袖就公民運動議題製作廣播節目。\n\n\n1959年，聖公會何明華為運動撰寫《良好的基督徒應該是積極的公民嗎？給全香港基督徒的幾個新約聖經問題》，根據《馬太》《路加》《約翰》福音經文，幫助基督徒從「基督國度」反思如何關心社會（何明華1959）。\n\n\n1961年，委員會與《華僑日報》合辦「良好公民」攝影比賽，獲獎100幀相片於香港大會堂公開展覽。1962年，出版一套合共64幅《良好公民》漫畫集。1965年，訂下7月作「基督徒公民主日」，藉此在教會作推廣教導。\n\n\n委員會曾就下列社會議題，表達意見：聲援反對足球博彩合法化（1959）、上書政府反對外圍馬合法化（1964）、反對在九龍地區增酒吧數目（1966）、倡議反吸毒群眾運動（1966）等。\n\n\n (6) Actress Mui Yee Abandons Acting for Evangelism, 1959 (Xing Fuzeng, 2021a, 2021b)\n\n\nMui Yee (1923–1966), born Kong Tuen-Yee, was a native of Nanhai, Guangdong, born in Beijing. At the age of 7, she was baptized in a church in Shanghai, where her mother took her. Mui Yee lived in both Shanghai and Guangzhou and started her career as a child star. In 1937, she began acting in Hong Kong, starring in her first film, After Many Trials (1937), directed by her uncle, renowned playwright Kong Yu-Leung (also known as Nam Hoi Sup Sam Long). After World War II, she moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai and resumed her film career, appearing in over 70 movies, including Night in Shanghai (1931), Madame Butterfly (1948), Everlasting Regret (1948), The Family (1953), Sunrise (1953), Sisters of the Lotus (1954), Tragedy of the Rich (1956), The Lotus Lantern (1956), and The Feast of the Rich (1959).\n\n\nMui Yee’s renewed faith in Christ was inspired by fellow Christian actress Pak Suet Sin (Chow Kit Lin), leading her to attend the Evangelistic Academy of the China Evangelistic Mission, where she experienced spiritual rebirth. Reflecting on her past, she confessed:  \n\n\"Although I called myself a Christian, I lacked the life of Christ. I started acting at the age of six, living a life immersed in the illusions of drama, filled with pride, indulgence, and a relentless pursuit of fame and fortune. I was like a lost sheep, straying far from the path.\"\n\n\nIn late 1958, a severe gastric ulcer left Mui Yee bedridden for two months. During her illness, she tearfully confessed her sins to God. After her recovery, she became passionate about sharing the gospel and decided to leave the film industry, proclaiming:  \n\n\"Before the Lord, I resolve to abandon worldly ties and live as a pure bride for Him. No matter the joys or sufferings in this life, I am determined to walk the path of the cross.\"\n\n\nIn March 1959, she began hosting weekly home gospel gatherings. By September, during a filming scene that required her to dive into the sea, she felt that her old self, \"Mui Yee,\" was buried in the depths. Emerging from the water, she declared, \"The life I now live is no longer mine.\" Shortly afterward, she left the entertainment industry and began her evangelistic work, viewing the pulpit as her \"second stage.\" Mui Yee preached at churches across Hong Kong and Macau and was frequently invited to lead revival meetings, leveraging her fame to draw audiences.\n\n\nIn 1961, she was diagnosed with tongue cancer. Deciding to fully rely on her faith, she refused medical treatment. From July onward, she claimed to have been filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues. From May 1, 1962, to April 2, 1963, she entered a prayer chamber, fasting and praying while writing a 300,000-word manuscript titled Collected Sermons on Life. Her turn toward charismatic practices led to accusations of heresy from Hong Kong churches, who viewed her as influenced by \"evil spirits.\" In June and September of 1963, Mui Yee formed the \"Charismatic Evangelistic Mission\" and conducted successful but controversial preaching tours in Malaysia and Singapore. She argued for dismantling denominational structures and rebuilding a New Testament church aligned with God's will, also predicting a great revival in 1966. These positions were criticized by churches as divisive.\n\n\nMui Yee passed away in August 1966. Newspapers reported her death under headlines such as \"Extraordinary Actress Mui Yee Succumbs to Throat Cancer.\" Her funeral attracted attention for its unusual nature, as the funeral parlor was turned into a preaching venue. Mui Yee left behind several works, including Acts of the Holy Spirit (Volumes I and II), Golden Lampstands (Volumes I and II), The Book of Esther, Entering the Kingdom of God, Behold! The Glorious Works of God, and For the Sake of Defending Truth. After her death, some believers in Taiwan, inspired by her teachings, established a New Testament Church.\n\n(6) 影星梅綺棄影傳教1959（邢福增2021a, 2021b）\n\n\n梅綺（1923-1966），原名江端儀，廣東南海人，生於北京。7歲時在上海被母親帶教會領洗，先後在上海、廣州生活，並任童星。1937年在香港從影，首部演出電影是「百戰餘生」（1937），由叔父著名劇作家江譽鏐（南海十三郎）執導。戰後由上海來港重投電影曾演出電影合共七十多部，包括《夜上海》（1931）、《蝴蝶夫人》（1948）、《此恨綿綿無絕期》（1948）、《家》（1953）、《日出》（1953）、《金蘭姊妹》（1954）、《朱門怨》（1956）、《寶蓮燈》（1956）、《豪門夜宴》（1959）等等。\n\n\n由於另一位基督徒影星紫羅蓮（鄒潔蓮）關係，她重拾對基督的信仰，並參加中華傳道會培靈學院，得著重生。據她日後自述，「我自己雖名為教友，卻無基督的生命。」「在六歲時我就開始我的演戲生涯，真可以說：我一生是浸淫在水月鏡花，疑幻疑真的戲劇裡面。我一直在罪中過著驕、奢、淫、逸、爭名奪利的生活，真是如羊走迷，偏行己路。」1958年底，因胃潰瘍病而臥床兩個月，深感痛苦，在病中向神流淚認罪。病癒後，熱心傳道。後決定離開電影界，「在主前我今立志拋棄俗世塵緣，為祂作個貞潔童女，今生無論遇福遇苦，決心隨祂走十架路」。1959年3月，她開始家庭福音聚會，每周一次分享信仰。她9月，在拍攝電影中一跳海鏡頭後，她感到昔日的「梅綺」已埋葬在海底，浮出水面時，「如今活著的不再是我了」。自此，她即告別影藝事業，並開始講壇工作，並以此作「第二舞台」，在香港及澳門各教會佈道。由於江端儀原是著名影星，故獲很多教會邀請主領奮興佈道。\n\n\n1961確診舌癌後，江決定全心依靠信仰，不再尋求醫藥幫助。7月起，經歷聖靈充滿後，開始講方言。1962年5月1日至63年4月2日進入密室，禁食禱告，完成《生命證道集》30萬字。由於她開始轉向靈恩，故香港教會將其視作「異端」「邪靈」。1963年6 月及9月，組成「靈恩佈道團」，先後到星馬一帶佈道，深受信徒歡迎，但也引發爭議。除了靈恩傾向外，她又認為奉聖靈差遣要拆除人為的宗派組織，要重建合神心意新約教會。她又預言1966年有大復興。不過，這些批評宗派的主張被眾教會指為「分裂教會」。\n\n1966年8月，因病離世。報章以「藝海奇女子梅綺，患喉癌不治逝世」報導。出殯時也報導「梅綺遺言指定死後三天下葬，便可化作聖女」……「梅綺出殯儀式特別，殯儀館變成講道堂」……著有《聖靈行傳〉（上下集）、《金燈台》（二集）、《以斯帖記》、《進神的國》、《看啊！神榮耀的作為》、《我們為了辯明真理》等書。江離世後，有台灣信徒受其影響，建立新約教會。 \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n(1) Hong Kong Edition of the Chinese Bible (Xing Fuzeng, 2013)\n\n\nDue to the tense political situation in China, the Executive Committee of the National Bible Society of China, headquartered in Shanghai, decided in 1948 to send David McGavin, a Western secretary, to Hong Kong to explore the possibility of printing Chinese Bibles there. Upon his arrival, McGavin collaborated with the Hong Kong Bible Society, using its office to begin operations. By late 1949, Bibles printed in Hong Kong could no longer be shipped to Shanghai and had to be distributed locally. The first Hong Kong edition of the Chinese Bible was released in early 1950. By then, communication with the Shanghai office had dwindled and was fully severed the following year. The Hong Kong office assumed independent operations, becoming the \"Hong Kong Bible House\" and taking over the responsibility of supplying Bibles worldwide, previously managed by the Shanghai headquarters.\n\n\nThe newly established Hong Kong Bible House also functioned as the Hong Kong Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society, publishing its annual reports under this title. In 1960, the organization underwent restructuring to include participation from the American, Scottish, and Canadian Bible Societies, and was renamed the \"Hong Kong Auxiliary of the Bible Society.\" The Hong Kong Bible House also changed its name to the \"Bible Societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\" However, in November 1964, Hong Kong and Taiwan decided to manage their finances separately, leading to the removal of \"Taiwan\" from the name. From 1965 onward, it officially published its reports as the \"Hong Kong Bible Society.\"\n\n\nBetween 1949 and August 1952, the Hong Kong Bible Society printed 28 editions of the Bible, 12 editions of the New Testament, and nine single books (primarily the Gospels and Acts), totaling 2,485,975 copies. In addition to Mandarin editions, the society also printed versions in Xiamenese, Hlai, Bunong, Vietnamese, and other languages. These Bibles were distributed not only in Hong Kong and Taiwan but also across Southeast Asia (e.g., Burma, Siam, Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, and the South Seas Islands), as well as New Zealand, South America, Mexico, the United States, India, Europe, and South Africa. Hong Kong became a global hub for the supply of Chinese Bibles, as well as Bibles in Chinese dialects and various other languages.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Hymnals (Xing Fuzeng, 2013)\n\n\nOver the past 50 years, various denominations in Hong Kong have met the needs of their congregations by reprinting hymnals previously published in China while also facing the challenge of revising or creating new hymnals. Below are summaries of key hymnals:\n\n\n Hymns of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (1950) and Youth Hymnal (1951–1973):  \n\nThe Christian and Missionary Alliance's Hymns of the Christian and Missionary Alliance was compiled in 1940 by Liu Fukwan and included 287 hymns. After relocating from Wuzhou to Hong Kong in 1949, Liu re-established the Alliance Bible Seminary in Hong Kong and oversaw the publication of the hymnal in 1950 through the Alliance Bookroom.\n\n\nIn the fall of 1950, Liu conceived the idea of creating a bilingual hymnal for spiritually wounded youth and enlisted the help of Ho Tung Hung, who had also relocated from Wuzhou. The first hymn translated was Cleanse Me. Over time, they continued translating hymns, publishing each set of 50 as a volume of the Youth Hymnal through the Alliance Bookroom. From 1951 to 1973, ten volumes were published, with Liu working on the final volume before his death in 1972. Ho continued the project, publishing the 11th and 12th volumes in 1981. Comprehensive editions were also released in 1960, 1970, and 1981, with total circulation reaching approximately 400,000 copies. The first volume alone sold 45,000 copies by 1971. Liu noted that the hymnal emphasized themes of evangelism and Christ's return, making it popular across denominational lines and widely adopted by youth fellowships.\n\n\n Hymns of Praise (1953):  \n\nThe Hymns of Praise, long used by the China Inland Mission (CIM), underwent revisions as early as the 19th century. After several updates, a revised edition was published in 1950 by the CIM's publishing arm, later rebranded as the Truth & Life Press in Hong Kong. The hymnal reached its 12th edition by 1965.\n\n\n Hymns of Praise (1954):  \n\nThis hymnal, initially developed in the U.S. under the leadership of I. Daehlin of the Lutheran Church in 1915, was first published in China in 1920 as a provisional edition. It was revised in 1924 and included 450 hymns, 6% of which were original Chinese compositions. Further revisions were planned in 1946 but delayed until 1955 due to political upheavals. The final revision in Hong Kong included 600 hymns and incorporated selections from earlier editions.\n\n\nHymns of Universal Praise (1955):  \n\nIn the 1920s, six major Christian denominations in China formed a committee to compile a joint hymnal, resulting in the publication of Hymns of Universal Praise in 1936 by the Christian Literature Society in Shanghai. It was reprinted in Hong Kong by the Christian Literature Bookroom in 1955.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Christian Literature and Theological Translations (Xing Fuzeng, 2013)\n\n\nThe Christian Literature Bookroom in Hong Kong inherited the publishing vision of the Christian Literature Society in Shanghai, emphasizing openness and a global perspective. Under the leadership of Executive Committee Chairman Chou Yuk Hei (1959–1966) and Secretary-General Hubert W. Spillett (1953–1967), its key publishing focuses included:  \n\n1. Christianity and Chinese culture,  \n\n2. Modern Christian thought,  \n\n3. Biblical interpretation,  \n\n4. Contemporary issues,  \n\n5. Christian family life,  \n\n6. Christian education,  \n\n7. Creative works and translations, and  \n\n8. Stories and novels.\n\n\nThis approach reflected the Bookroom's commitment to global engagement and modern relevance, distinguishing it in Hong Kong's Christian publishing landscape.\n\n\nAnother significant initiative was the publication of the Collected Works of Christian Classics. Initially managed by the Nanjing Theological Seminary Trust Department under Methodist missionary Francis P. Jones in the 1940s, the project relocated to Drew University in the U.S. in 1951. The collection consisted of three series with over 30 volumes, with the first volume published in September 1952. These translations represented a major achievement in the field of theological and ecclesiastical literature in Hong Kong during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n(1) 香港版中文聖經（邢福增 2013）\n\n 由於中國局勢緊張，總部位於上海的中華聖經會執委會於1948年議決，先派一位西籍秘書麥興仁（David McGavin）來港，考慮轉移到香港印製中文聖經的問題。來港後，麥氏與香港聖書公會聯絡，借用其辦事處，並於1949年底開始工作，當時印妥的聖經已不能運到上海而要在香港卸下。首批港版中文聖經於1950年初面世。這時，香港辦事處與與上海中華聖經會的聯絡已日漸縮少（到翌年更完全中斷），並取代其工作，成為獨立的代理機關，稱「香港聖經會」（Hong Kong Bible House），負起以前中華聖經會供應世界各地聖經的責任。\n\n\n新成立的香港聖經會，同時具備「英國聖書公會香港輔導委員會」（British and Foreign Bible Society, Hong Kong Auxiliary）的身份，甚至每年的年報，也是以後者名義出版的。1960年起，該會改組，除英國聖書公會外，增加了美國、蘇格蘭及加拿大的聖經會的參與，名稱改為「聖經公會香港輔導會」（Hong Kong Auxiliary of the Bible Society）。而香港聖經會也易名為「香港及台灣聖經公會」（Bible Societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan）。1964年11月起，港台兩地決定分開帳目，故移除名字中的「台灣」名稱，重新命名為「香港聖經公會」（Bible Societies in Hong Kong）。1965年起，便正式以香港聖經公會名義出版年報。\n\n\n從1949至1952年8月間，香港聖經會合共印了廿八版聖經，十二版新約全書及九版的單行本（主要是四福音書和使徒行傳），總數達2485975冊，除了國語本外，尚有廈門語、華黎族語、東黎族語、Bunman族語、越南語等。聖經供給的地區，除香港及台灣外，更達東南亞各國（如緬甸、暹羅、越南、馬來亞、印尼、菲律賓、日本、南洋群島），甚至新西蘭、南美洲、墨西哥、美國、印度及歐洲及南菲等處。香港成為全球中文聖經供應中心，除中文聖經外，又印製其他中國方言及不同國家語文聖經。\n\n(2) 聖詩（邢福增 2013）\n\n五十年來以降，各宗派在港為滿足信徒的需要，一方面將原有在中國刊行的詩集重印，另方面也面對修訂及新修詩集的挑戰。茲簡介各主要詩集的情況：\n\n《宣道詩》（1950）與《青年聖歌》（1951-1973）：宣道會的中文詩歌《宣道詩》是1940年由劉福群編纂，收錄了287首聖詩。 1949年，劉福群從梧州抵港，籌備建道在港復校。1950年，《宣道詩》也在香港的宣道書局出版。\n\n\n1950年秋，劉福群萌生為心靈創傷的青年人編一本中英對照詩集的念頭。於是他找來從梧州來港的何統雄協助翻譯。第一首譯的聖詩就是 Cleanse Me （潔淨我）。 此後，他們繼續翻譯，每譯畢五十首時，便以《青年聖歌》之名，由宣道書局出版。1951年出版第一集以來，至劉福群在1972年病逝，共出版了九集（1954、1956、1959、1964、1967、1968、1969、1971），劉離世前參與的第十集也在1973年出版。後來何氏仍繼續有關工作，於1981年出版第十一及十二集。1960年，宣道書局又出版了《青聖綜合本（一）》，《青聖綜合本（二）》及《青聖綜合本（三）》分別在1970及1981年出版。據統計，《青聖》單行本的印行量多年來共達353,905冊，而《青聖》之三本綜合本，其印行量約為四十萬本。\n\n\n《青年聖詩》第一集於1951年面世以來，一直深受各地華人教會及信徒的歡迎。劉福群指，他選擇的詩歌「着重傳福音及主再來的信息」，因此能夠受到跨宗派的擁戴，不同宗派的青年團契，均採用這本詩集。在1971年，單是第一集就售出了45,000本。\n\n\n《頌主聖歌》（1953）：內地會沿用的《頌主聖歌》，早於十九世紀已問世使用，並於1900年作修正。1917年，成立詩歌委員會再修修訂，其於1921年出版新版，後又於1941年重訂。1950年，內地會又出版修正版，但不以內地會名義，而改由廣協書局出版，並獲楊紹唐撰寫序言。內地會出版部遷港，並改組為證道出版社後，於1953年再版《頌主聖歌》，到1965年已出至十二版。\n\n\n《頌主聖詩》（1954）：《頌主聖詩》自1915年起即在美國的戴懷仁（I. Daehlin）領導下開始編修，終於在1920年中華信義會成立時出版了《暫用文字本》。1924年，信義書報部出版了《頌主聖詩修正本》，除文字本外，也印行了曲譜本。負責修訂的謝受靈及唐務道（Olav Dalland）將詩歌總數減至450首，其中百分之六為中文創作。1946年，中華信義會第七屆大會再次通過重修，並於1948年成立編修委會，由馬天生任主席。但因政局急變，這一重修計劃延遲到1955年才在香港完成。\n\n\n 1951年9月，出版部通過授權馬天生及汪爕堯二教授物色適當人員進行修訂。馬牧師在顏路裔、王翰章、朱學賢等協助下完成是項重要工作。1954年，新的《頌主聖詩簡譜本》問世，翌年，線譜本亦告出版。該詩本共有詩歌六百首，其中二百四十六首選自1920年和1924年的詩本。 \n\n\n《普天頌讚》（1955）：1920年代，中國基督教六大公會（中華基督教會全國總會、中華聖公會、美以美會、華北公理會、華東浸禮會及監理會），決定組成「六公會聯合聖歌委員會」，編修聯合詩歌集。1936年，由上海廣學會出版《頌天頌讚》。1955年，輔僑在港再版《普天頌讚》。\n\n\n(3) 基督教文字及神學編譯（邢福增 2013）\n\n基督教輔僑出版社，由於承繼了廣學會的出版路線，在出版方針上，較具開放性及普世性。在1959至1966年任執委會主席的周郁晞，在總幹事蘇佩禮（Hubert W. Spillet）退休卸任時，曾總結蘇氏任期（1953至1967）年間的出版重點：（一）基督教與中國文化；（二）現代基督教的思想；（三）聖經的解釋方法；（四）現代問題；（五）基督化家庭；（六）基督教教育；（七）創作與翻譯；（八）故事與小說。其中在信仰與文化、時代思潮及，現代社會問題，以及譯經學新方法方面，在在反映出輔僑的普世化取向，在當時整個香港基督教文字出版版圖上，具有其獨到的特色。\n\n\n輔僑（文藝）另一項重要的事工，就是出版「基督教歷代名著集成」。整套叢書的編譯工作原由金陵神學院託事部主持，把基督教二千年來的重要典籍譯成中文。籌備工作於四十年代期開始，主事者為衛理公會傳教士章文新（Francis P. Jones）。1951年，託事部決定在美國繼續有關工作，並於美國哲吾大學（Drew University）附設編譯所。叢書包括三部，合共30多卷。首冊於1952年9月出版。這套叢書，可說是五十至六十年代香港文字出版事業中，在教會及神學文獻漢譯方面的重要成果。\n\n\n  \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian leaders.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教領袖 \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教組織 \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nDuring this decade, there were no significant anti-Christian events or movements.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教事件/運動 ",
