His grandfather, Wong Chun-kwong, and father, Wong Siu-tuen, were both members and preachers of the Rhenish Mission. Wong Oi-tong studied at the Rhenish Primary School in Fuyong, Bao’an County, before attending Rhenish Secondary School in Yeshan, Tangxia, Dongguan. At the age of 20, he entered the Rhenish Theological Seminary in Dongguan and graduated at 22. The following year, he was ordained as a preacher for the Rhenish Mission. After arriving in Hong Kong in 1909, he remained there permanently. \n\n\nIn 1914, when the Rhenish Church in Hong Kong was established, Wong assisted Pastor Chan Koon-hai in managing church affairs. During World War I, due to hostilities between Britain and Germany, German missionaries in Hong Kong were ordered to leave. As the Rhenish Mission had German roots, it was placed under the custody of the London Missionary Society. Wong drafted and established the church's regulations during this period. In 1917, he was ordained as a pastor in Humen. By 1925, after the London Missionary Society completed its custodianship, the Rhenish Mission achieved self-governance. In 1926, Pastor Yip To-sheng arrived to take over church administration, and Wong was elected Vice President of the General Assembly.\n\n\nWong was also a founding member of the Hong Kong Christian Council in 1914, serving as its first secretary and drafting its constitution. He held various roles, such as head of the Council's Evangelism and Public Cemetery Departments. Wong actively opposed the practice of keeping slave girls, publishing articles in The Great Light Newspaper to condemn this custom. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in 1941, Wong was appointed President of the Japanese-controlled Hong Kong Christian Council due to the Rhenish Mission's German background. After the war, the Council was disbanded, and its departments resumed their activities. Wong suffered a stroke in December 1948, leaving him paralyzed, and he passed away in May 1957.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(2) Moritaka Samejima (鮫島盛隆, 1897–1986)  \n\n(Cited from Chen Zhiheng, 2009: 234-246; Samejima Moritaka, 1971)\n\n\nMoritaka Samejima was born in December 1897 in Sasebo, Nagasaki. After graduating from the Kansai Gakuin Theological Department in 1927, he pursued further studies at Emory University and the San Francisco Theological Seminary. In 1931, he was ordained as a pastor at the Kobe Hirano Methodist Church and became the district superintendent of the Korean Methodist Church in Seoul in 1934. In 1941, he was appointed Chaplain (later Religious Director) at Kansai University.\n\n\nIn September 1943, Samejima was summoned to Hong Kong to serve as an advisor to the Japanese-controlled \"Hong Kong Christian Council,\" a position he held until the war's end. His primary duty was to act as a liaison between the Japanese governor’s office and the Christian churches. For instance, upon learning that the Japanese military intended to remove the stained-glass windows of St. John’s Cathedral, Samejima intervened to ensure their preservation. He also opposed the conversion of churches into stables and worked to secure the release of Reverend Chang Chu-ling, who was falsely accused of espionage by the Japanese military.\n\n\nAfter Japan's surrender, Samejima was interned and later repatriated to Japan. In 1946, he returned to Kansai Gakuin as Dean of Student Affairs and served as the eighth Chaplain from November 1946 to June 1948. From 1951 to 1974, he was the President of Chinzei Gakuin. Samejima revisited Hong Kong in 1969, where he was warmly received by the local church community. In 1970, he published Recollections of Hong Kong: The Church Under Occupation, which was translated into Chinese the following year. He passed away in February 1986.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(3) Yan-Tak Woo (胡恩德, 1907–2005)  \n\n(Cited from Xing Fuzeng, 2014a: 203-206)\n\n\nYan-Tak Woo was born in May 1907 into a prominent Christian family in Hong Kong. His grandfather, Woo Him-hang (1830–1889), was a pastor in the Berlin Mission, while his father, Woo Yee-tung (1884–1948), served as a deacon at St. Stephen’s Church under the Anglican Church. Yan-Tak Woo was the second of eight children. He was baptized at St. Stephen’s Church at birth. His mother, Wong Pik-lin (1885–1965), was the seventh daughter of Pastor Wong Chim-yu (1847–1907), a minister in the Rhenish Mission and a member of the Chinese Evangelistic Society founded by Karl Gützlaff.\n\n\nWoo attended Ying Wa Girls' School and a sports school in Central before enrolling at Diocesan Boys’ School. In 1926, while preparing for the University of Hong Kong’s entrance exam, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved to his cousin’s clinic in Aberdeen to recover. During this period, he attended the first Believers’ Bible Conference in 1927, where he was deeply influenced by Pastor Wong Yuen-so (Christian and Missionary Alliance in Guangxi). Woo experienced a profound spiritual awakening, leading to his active ministry. \n\n\nFrom 1930 to 1935, Woo assumed full-time ministry responsibilities at the Joyful Church, initially established by Julia Meadows, a faith missionary. He continued leading the church through its relocations and name changes, eventually settling in Tai Po Road under the name Joyful Gospel Church by 1937.\n\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in 1941, Woo refused to join the Japanese-controlled Christian Council, citing \"differences in faith.\" As a result, he faced pressure and was briefly detained by the Japanese military police on suspicions of collaborating with Western powers.\n\n\nAfter the war, Woo was invited to lead revival meetings across China and became a prominent preacher, especially influential in student fellowship movements. His ministry and the Joyful Gospel Church became significant references for the evangelical movement in Hong Kong. Woo later served as the principal of seminaries in Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. He authored numerous works, including Running Toward the Goal, Table Devotions, and The Christian and the Sabbath. Woo passed away in 2005 after a long illness.\n\n(1)王愛棠 Wong Oi-tong（李志剛2014：31-35）\n\n\n王愛棠（1881–1957），廣東東莞人，第三代信徒，祖父王振光、父親王肇端是禮賢會信徒及傳道。王愛棠於寶安縣福永禮賢小學就讀，後進入東莞塘廈耶山禮賢中學。20歲進東莞禮賢會神學院，22歲畢業後，翌年受禮賢會宣教師職。自1909年來港後，一直留港。1914年香港禮賢會堂落成後，王愛棠協助陳觀海牧師主理堂務。自歐戰爆發後，由於英德兩國為交戰國，德國在香港的傳教士限令離港。禮賢會具德國背景，教會須由倫敦會接管作監護人。是時教會規章悉由王愛棠起草訂立。1917年在虎門按立為牧師。1925年後，倫敦會完成托管，禮賢會已具自理基礎。1926年禮賢會差會按葉道勝牧師來港接收事務，王愛棠被選為總會會副。\n\n\n1914年，香港基督教聯會創建，王愛棠為起草章程委員，並出任首屆聯會書記。歷任聯會傳道部、公墳部部長等職。他亦積極參與反對蓄婢運動，曾撰文於《大光報》，指斥蓄婢惡習。1941年12月25日香港淪陷後，日本為控制基督教，於1942年2月成立香港基督教總會，要求各宗派突會合一，隸屬總會。由於日本與德國為同盟關係，故正會長一職，由德國背景的禮賢會王愛棠出任，成為日治時期香港教會領袖。戰後，總會解散，聯會各部復員。1948年12月，因突發腦溢血致身體癱瘓，1957年5月離世。\n\n\n(2) 鮫島盛隆 Moritaka Samejima（陳智衡2009：234-246；鮫島盛隆1971）\n\n\n鮫島盛隆（Moritaka Samejima, 1897-1986），1897年（明治三十年）12月生於長崎佐世保市。1927年，關西學院神學部畢業後，畢業於埃默里大學（Emory University）神學部及研究院，以及舊金山神學院研究院。1931年，按立為日本衛理公會神戶平野教會牧師，1934年被任命為漢城衛理公會牧師兼朝鮮教區長。1941年就任關西大學禮拜主任（1943年4月後更名為宗教主任）。\n\n\n1943年9月起，應召徵調至香港任「香港基督教總會」顧問，至休戰止。1943年9月，鮫島經上海到廣州抵九龍。總會顧問一職，主要任務是作為總督部與基督教會間的溝通。例如，在得悉日軍欲拆除聖約翰座堂的彩繪玻璃後，他立即向高級副官反映，最後可讓教會自行拆下保存。對於部分教堂內設置被拆毀，甚至被改為軍隊馬廐，鮫島均不予認同。又，合一堂張祝齡牧師被日軍誤為「間諜」被捕，鮫島亦多方營救。他曾指出，日軍高級軍人一般較尊重教會，橫蠻殘酷者多為低級官兵。可以說，鮫島作為日本顧問牧師，確在各種限制下，致力協助淪陷期間香港基督教的維持。日本投降後，他也被送到扣留營中，等候遣交回日本。\n\n\n1946年，他回到關西學院擔任學生課長。自1946年11月至1948年6月間，任關西學院堂禮拜第八任牧師。1951年至1974年間，就任鎮西學院院長。1969年夏天，鮫島重訪香港，並獲香港教會界熱情接待。他在1970年出版了有關香港的回憶錄《香港回想記：占領下の教会に召されて》，翌年中譯本《香港回想記：日軍佔領下的香港教會》在香港出版。1986年2月離世。\n\n\n(3) 胡恩德 Yan-Tak Woo（邢福增2014a：203-206）\n\n\n胡恩德（1907-2005），廣東鶴山人。1907年5月生於香港的著名基督徒世家，其祖父胡謙亨（胡夑菴，1830-1889）是巴陵會（Berlin Mission）牧師。父親胡爾棟（1884-1948）是聖公會聖士提反堂執事，與妻王碧蓮（1885-1965）育有子女八人，胡恩德是次男，出生後即於聖士提反堂領洗。母親是王謙如牧師的七女，王謙如（1847-1907）是香港禮賢會牧師，其父王元深（1817-1914）早年為郭實獵（Karl F. A. C. Gützlaff）創立的福漢會成員，後成為禮賢會資深元老。\n\n\n胡恩德先後於英華女校及中環鐵崗的體育學校就讀，後入讀拔萃書院。1926年參加港大入學試期間，發現患上肺癆，乃遷居堂兄胡惠德於香港仔的診所樓上養病。期間參加1927年舉辦的第一屆培靈研經會，深受講員黃原素（廣西宣道會）牧師感召，「你知道自己得救沒有？」對他影響尤深。他深覺自己雖在教會長大，卻全無得救把握。他晚上深切為己罪悔改，並寫自己所患的十多件罪行，逐一認罪。同年，胡恩德再讀到倪柝聲編著的《靈修指微》、《十字架的使者》、《人是因做好得救麼？》、《得救的實證》等著作，深受影響。1928年，他開始到信心傳教士美愛清（Miss Julia Meadows）創立喜樂堂聚會，自此改變了其事奉路向。1930至1935年間，美姑娘因身體關係曾兩度回國，胡即承擔全時間傳道工作。美姑娘第一次離港時，聖經學校停辦，教會遷至醫局街，1934年又遷往鴨寮街。期間，教會的名稱改為「喜樂福音堂」。1934至37年間，一度易名「福音堂」。1936年夏，美姑娘再回國，此後未有回港。1937年， 教會遷大埔道，再用「喜樂福音堂」的名稱。\n\n\n1941年12月，香港淪陷。日本總督部對基督教的主要政策，是設立香港基督教總會，要求所有教會不分任何宗派，統一加入。總會由日本派來的牧師鮫島盛隆任顧問，王愛棠及劉粵聲分別出任正、副會長。當時大部分教會因形勢所逼，均加入總會。但胡卻以「信仰不同」為由拒絕參加，為此承受不少壓力。同時，日本憲兵亦懷疑他與英美勾結，故一度將他扣留於深水埗憲兵部，未幾獲釋。\n\n\n戰後，胡恩德應邀到內地（廣州、廈門、南京等地）領會，也跟趙君影牧師等合作。胡恩德是當時受重用的講員，獲邀主領許多夏令會及培靈會，燃點了復興之火，特別對學生團契的復興，更功不可沒。胡恩德的個人靈命、喜樂福音堂的會堂路線及聚會模式，成為福音堂運動的屬靈路線的重要參照。\n\n\n胡恩德曾擔任海外的神學院（新加坡、菲律賓）及香港廣州聖經學院的院長。1965、1966及1973年，他先後獲邀任港九培靈研經會的講員，負責研經會及講道會。此外，他又出版多種著作，如《朝向目標直跑》、《桌前默想》、《祂是信實的》、《靈程點滴》、《從聖經看靈恩運動》、《靈恩運動》、《勝利生洽秘袂》、《基列的乳香》、《基督徒與安息日》等多種。2005年，因病辭世。\n\n(4) John So (蘇佐揚, 1916–2007)  \n\n(Cited from Li Jinqiang, 2014: 211-213)\n\n\nJohn So was born in 1916 in Hong Kong to a Christian family from Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province. A third-generation Christian, So was passionate about music and literature from an early age, composing over 600 Hymns of Heaven and Earth and more than 200 Sacred Songs of Heaven and Earth throughout his life. In 1931, he committed to serving God after attending a revival meeting in Kowloon led by Chinese evangelist Song Shangjie (John Sung). In 1934, So went to the North China Theological Seminary in Teng County, Shandong Province, for theological education. After graduating in 1937, he engaged in rural evangelism in Zhangjiakou, Chahar, and Shanxi before returning to Hong Kong.\n\n\nIn 1940, So was invited to assist in editing a Hebrew dictionary and teaching music at the North China Theological Seminary. In 1941, Pastor Yang Shaotang invited him to teach Hebrew in Tianjin’s Spiritual Work League. Later, he returned to Hong Kong to teach biblical studies at the Bethel Theological Seminary, which had relocated from Shanghai. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, So fled to Zhangzhou, Fujian, where he founded the Heaven and Earth Daily. In 1943, he joined the faculty at Guizhou Bethel Theological Seminary, where he also launched The Gospel Magazine for the Miao Christian community. He later taught at the China Spiritual Theology Seminary in Chongqing, working alongside Pastor Jia Yuming.\n\n\nIn 1945, So served as the General Secretary of the “Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Christian Federation,” promoting inter-church initiatives in Northwest China. He was ordained as a pastor in Gansu in 1947 and later worked in Shanghai with the China Inland Mission on literature ministry before returning to Hong Kong in 1948.\n\n\nBetween 1953 and 1961, So embarked on an eight-year evangelistic journey across East Asia, preaching in 13 countries, including Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Indonesia. From 1962 to 1976, he undertook global evangelistic tours across six continents and more than 50 countries. In 1976, after returning from the Americas, he became president of the “Global Evangelistic Association” and founded the “Christian Heaven and Earth Society,” publishing over 50 books, including Bible Difficulties (10 volumes), New Testament Meditations (8 volumes), and Old Testament Insights (3 volumes). \n\n\nHe passed away in September 2007 at the age of 91.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(5) John K. C. Ma (馬敬全, 1917–2011)  \n\n(Cited from Congregational Church, 2012; Peng Shumin, 2014: 92-95)\n\n\nJohn K. C. Ma was born in 1917 at the site of the Hong Kong Congregational Church. As a teenager, he accompanied his father, Pastor Ma Yaodong, in street evangelism, playing the accordion and leading hymns. After graduating from Wah Yan College in 1935, he worked at the Salvation Army in Guangzhou. During World War II, he served as a member of the International Relief Council. In 1944, Ma graduated from the Union Theological Seminary in Guangzhou and became the pastor of the Qujiang Chapel of the Chinese YMCA in 1945. The following year, he was appointed Youth Secretary of the Guangdong Association of the Chinese Christian Church and was ordained as a pastor at Renji Chapel in Guangzhou in 1946.\n\n\nIn 1947, Ma attended the World Christian Youth Conference in Oslo, where he reaffirmed his lifelong call to ministry. After the conference, during a stopover in Hong Kong, he learned of the Congregational Church’s urgent need for leadership. In September 1947, Ma decided to stay and became the second senior pastor of the Congregational Church, serving for 40 years until his retirement in 1987, except for a year of advanced study at Union Theological Seminary in New York (1956–1957).\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Ma initiated the construction of new church facilities. To fund the Leighton Road Chapel, he proposed issuing bonds with a 5% annual interest, a plan that successfully raised the required funds within a year. The chapel, initially called “Caroline Hill Road Chapel,” was dedicated in 1950. Later, Ma led the redevelopment of the Ladder Street church building, completed in 1971 and renamed “Bridges Street Chapel.”\n\n\nMa also taught at theological institutions, including the Hong Kong Theological Seminary, Chung Chi Divinity School, and the Lutheran Theological Seminary. He served as chairman of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China and as vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. Ma suggested limiting the union board members’ terms to six years with a mandatory one-year break after.\n\n\nHe passed away in April 2011 at the age of 94.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(6) Denial Cheung (張有光, 1917–1996)  \n\n(Cited from Wong Cailian, 2014: 42-46)\n\n\nDenial Cheung was born in 1917 in Gaoming, Guangdong Province, into a pastor’s family. His father, Cheung Shing-yau, was a minister of the Holiness Church.

The ordination was conducted at the small chapel of the Bishop's House by Bishop R. O. Hall, who performed three separate rites: transferring Zhao into the Anglican communion, commissioning him as a deacon, and ordaining him as a priest. Originally affiliated with the Methodist Church, Zhao’s connection with the Anglican Church was influenced by his longstanding relationship with Bishop Hall.  \n\n\nIn 1939, Zhao took a sabbatical from Yenching University and accepted an invitation to serve as a pastor at Wenlin Chapel in Kunming. During his time there, he inquired about joining the Anglican Church. Upon returning to Beijing, Zhao expressed that his sense of calling had become clearer. One of his students, Luo Zhenfang, recounted Zhao saying that the acceptance of church authority resolved many of his spiritual struggles. Bishop Hall recalled Zhao stating that he sought not only to “join the priesthood” but also to “submit to the priesthood.”  \n\n\nHowever, Zhao faced severe accusations during the 1951 denunciation campaigns at Yenching University. In response, Bishop Ling Xianyang of the North China Diocese publicly revoked Zhao’s priestly duties and all associated responsibilities. Despite this, Zhao was invited in 1954 as a delegate to the National Christian Conference, where he was elected as a committee member.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Publication of History of Christianity in Hong Kong, 1941  \n\n(Cited from Xing Fu Zeng, 2014b: 245-246)  \n\n\nThe publication of History of Christianity in Hong Kong was led by Pastor Liu Yue Sheng of the Baptist Independent Church on Caine Road. Liu had served in Guangzhou and Shanghai as a Baptist minister before being invited to pastor the Chinese Baptist Church in San Francisco (1929–1932). He returned to Guangzhou in 1932, becoming pastor of East Hill Baptist Church and holding positions such as President of the Guangdong Baptist Association and the National Baptist Union of China.  \n\n\nIn 1934, Liu edited A Brief History of Baptist Churches in Guangdong for the association and, in 1936, An Overview of Christianity in Guangzhou for the city’s Christian Council. After moving to Hong Kong in 1938, Liu was elected Vice President of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. Although the union lacked a formal publishing division, Liu spearheaded the editorial work for the History of Christianity in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nIn the preface, Liu explained that in April 1940, the union decided to compile and publish a historical record. A committee of seven, including prominent figures such as Zhang Zhu Ling, Wong Oi Tong, and Liu, oversaw the project. Divided into seven sections, the book covered denominational histories, church profiles, joint ventures, cultural endeavors, charitable work, social services, and biographies. Published in August 1941, it was described as a pioneering effort in documenting Hong Kong’s Christian history.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Anglican Church’s Ten-Year Forward Movement, 1946  \n\n(Cited from Zhong Ren Li, 1951: 33)  \n\n\nAfter World War II, Bishop R. O. Hall returned to Hong Kong and launched the “Ten-Year Forward Movement” in January 1946. This initiative aimed to double the number of believers and clergy within the Hong Kong and Guangdong Diocese over a decade. Members were encouraged to bring at least one friend to church each week and pray daily for those interested in faith.  \n\n\nThe movement formally began on January 25, 1946, with a flag presentation ceremony at St. John’s Cathedral. The flags, bearing St. Andrew’s Cross, symbolized the call to evangelize modeled after St. Andrew. In The Voice of the Church in South China, Pastor Zhong Ren Li emphasized the need for comprehensive promotion, including written materials to supplement in-person advocacy.\n\n\nThe Ten-Year Forward Movement was part of a broader post-war trend, as other denominations launched similar campaigns. For instance, the National Christian Council of China initiated a three-year “Christian Advance Campaign” (1947–1950) to spread the Gospel and rebuild moral foundations.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) Centenary of the Victoria Diocese, 1949  \n\n(Cited from Zhong Ren Li, 1951: 36-39)  \n\n\nThe Victoria Diocese, established in 1849, celebrated its centenary in 1949. Over the century, the diocese underwent several territorial changes, losing regions as new dioceses were formed, including North China (1872), Japan (1883), Fujian (1906), Guangxi-Hunan (1909), and Yunnan-Guizhou (1947). By 1947, the Hong Kong and Guangdong Diocese (formerly Victoria Diocese) covered Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Guangxi.\n\n\nCentenary events included a fundraising campaign, a diocesan council meeting, a study retreat, and a thanksgiving service. The council elected Reverend Mu Rong Xian as the Bishop of Guangdong. The celebration also produced historical accounts, including Zhong Ren Li’s A Brief History of the Anglican Diocese of South China (1951) and The Diocese of Victoria, Hong Kong: A Hundred Years Church History, 1849–1949 by George B. Endacott and Dorothy E. She.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Christian Contingency Meetings, 1949  \n\n(Cited from Xing Fu Zeng, 2004: 102; He Ming Zhang, 2021: 55-65)  \n\n\nAmid the Chinese Civil War, churches in South China prepared for Communist control. In July and August 1949, the Guangdong branch of the National Christian Council of China held a summer conference at Diocesan Boys’ School in Hong Kong, known as the “Guangdong Christian Affairs Review Conference.” Participants from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau discussed strategies for addressing Communist challenges.  \n\n\nChurches adopted a dual approach: while emphasizing that missionary organizations would not retreat immediately, they established financial offices in Hong Kong and relocated property deeds and archives as precautions.  \n\n\nFor instance, the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA) evacuated approximately 80 missionaries to Hong Kong in June 1949. Alfred C. Snead, Secretary-General of C&MA’s Foreign Missions Department, established a temporary “All-China Alliance Office” in Hong Kong, which operated until 1953, when the “China-Hong Kong Field” was formally created. This reflected the widespread strategic adjustments churches made to navigate the uncertain political landscape.\n\n(1)中國神學家趙紫宸在香港按牧（邢福增2003：139-140；吳青2017：76-79；Paton 1985: 103-105）\n\n\n1941年7月20日，中國著名神學家，燕京大學宗教學院院長趙紫宸毅然接受牧職。是次按牧的安排比較特別，他特地來到香港，在聖公會會督府的小禮堂內，由何明華主教（Bishop R. O. Hall）先後三次按手，為趙舉行轉會禮，派立他為會吏，按立他為會長（牧師）。趙氏原屬監理會，他與聖公會的聯繫，主要是因著何明華的關係。何、趙兩人相識多年，1938年秋冬之交，趙應全國協進會邀請，赴印度參加瑪德拉斯國際宣教會議。回國後 （1939年7月），他接受聖公會的邀請，乘著燕京大學安息年的機會，到雲南昆明的聖公會文林堂負責堂會的牧養工作。在昆明期間，趙曾向何明華查詢加入聖公會的可能。當趙回到北平後，表達自己的呼召變得深刻且清晰。燕大宗教學院畢業生駱振芳憶述趙曾對他們說：以前總是走個人追求信仰的道路，有些問題想不通就增加許多苦惱。後來受了聖公會聖職，在信仰上接受教會的權威，這樣可以解除許多思想矛盾和苦惱。何明華亦憶述，趙接受按立前嘗言，他接受牧職不僅是期望「加入聖品」（in orders），而更是希望「順服聖品」（under orders）。\n\n\n1951年3月，趙紫宸在燕京大學控訴運動中受到嚴厲指控，中華聖公會華北教區主教凌賢揚公開宣佈，撤銷趙會長及一切在聖公會華北教區的職務。1954年7月，趙以中華聖公會會長身分，獲邀請出席基督教全國會議，並選為全體委員之一。\n\n\n(2) 《香港基督教會史》出版1941（邢福增2014b：245-246）\n\n\n《香港基督教會史》的出版，實得力於香港堅道浸信自理會會牧劉粵聲。劉早年先後於廣州及上海任浸信會傳道，1929至1932年間應邀任美國三藩市華人自理浸信會牧師。1932年至1937年間任廣州東山浸信會牧師，兼兩廣浸信會會長、全國浸信聯合會長及廣州基督教聯會會長等職。1934年，兩廣浸信會聯會決定出版《兩廣浸信會史略》，便由劉氏主編。1936年間，他又承廣州基督教聯會所託，編著《廣州基督教概況》。1938年1月起，劉粵聲來港任浸信自理會會牧，同年被選為香港基督教聯會副會長。當時聯會仍未設有出版部，《香港基督教會史》的編輯工作， 便由劉氏一力承擔。\n\n \n\n劉粵聲在《香港基督教會史》的序言中指，聯會於1940年4月會議時決定編印有關會史，並選出張祝齡、翁挺生、鍾仁立、王愛棠、何道修、黃仲凱及劉粵聲等七人為委辦，負責彙編工作。全書分會宗史略、堂會史略、聯合事業、文化事業、慈善事業、社會事業及個人傳記七部分，主要由相關教會及組織人士賜稿，最後於1941年8月出版，可說是香港基督教會「嘗試之『創刊物』」。\n\n\n(3) 聖公會十年神國運動1946（鍾仁立1951：33）\n\n\n戰後復原，聖公會何明華主教回港主理教政，於1946年1月組織「十年神國運動」（Ten Year Forward Movement），由各堂展開工作，招收會員。運動旨在鼓勵信徒引人歸主，凡加入為會員者，每週至少須帶一人赴聖堂聽道，每日須為學道之親友禱告。「神國運動」的目的，是在十年內港粵教區信徒實現倍增，並使聖品人數由20人增至40人。1月25日，在聖約翰座堂舉行授旗典禮，何明華主教證道。各堂代表領旗一面，旗幟為聖安得烈之十架，勉勵信徒以聖安得烈引人歸主為模範。\n\n\n在《港粵教聲》復刊詞中，主編鍾仁立牧師提到神國運動的重要性：「神國運動，是我們教區復員後的一個新運動，是動員整個教區的人力物力來推進的。這樣一個大運動，想快快推進到鄉村裏面每一個工作場所，和一切計劃想有預期的成果，非有完備的宣傳工夫不可，除了派員去各處宣傳以外，應該有文字宣傳以副口舌宣傳之不逮。」事實上，回到戰後的歷史處境，神國運動並非創新之舉，其時全國不同宗派，也陸續推行類似的「前進運動」。例如1946年12月，中華全國基督教協進會決定於1947至1950年間發動「基督教奮進運動三年計劃」，目的就是宣揚基督福音及重建道德基礎。\n\n\n(4) 聖公會粵港/維多利亞教區百週年紀念1949（鍾仁立1951：36-39 ）\n\n\n1849年維多利亞教區成立，施美夫主教於是年5月被祝聖為教區主教。1949年是教區成立百週年紀念。一百年來，教區轄境歷幾改變，由原初全國中國（及日本），到1872年分出華北教區，1883年分出日本教區，1906年分出福建教區，1909年分出廣西－湖南教區，1947年分出雲貴教區。質言之，自1947年後，港粵教區（維多利亞教區）轄境包括香港、廣東及廣西。是次教區百週年紀念活動，包括：賣物會、百週年教區議會、講道進修會、百週年經常費運動及百週年紀念感恩崇拜大會。在8月舉行的百週年教區議會中，通過選出慕容賢會吏長為廣東主教。此外，又有關於教區百年史的編寫，分別為鍾仁立編著《中華聖公會華南教區百年史略》（1951），及George B Endacott & Dorothy E. She, The Diocese of Victoria, Hong Kong: A Hundred Years Church History, 1849-1949 （1949）。\n\n\n(5) 基督教應變會議 1949（邢福增 2004：102；何明章2021：55-65）\n\n\n面對國共內戰形勢的變化，華南地區各教會急謀應變。中華全國基督教協進會廣東分會於1949年7-8月間，在香港拔萃書院召開一次包括廣東省、香港和澳門地區的「宣教同工夏令會」，定名為「廣東基督教事工檢討會」，商討如何應付共產黨的挑戰。一般而言，各宗派及組織的部署大致相同，一方面重申差會機構暫不撤退，但另方面又在港設立財政機構或辦事處，並將契據及檔案移至香港，以為後著。\n\n\n美國宣道會方面，宣道會國外宣教部總幹事施納德（Alfred C. Snead）於1949年6月1至3日來港。召開特別會議，決定吩咐全部在中國的傳教士撤退至香港。當時有大約80名傳教士從撒離至香港，在等候差會進一步指示。6月底，施由越南西貢再返回香港，跟中國各教區主席商討，又接見傳教士，並按各人意願安排新的宣教工場。施回到美國向總會報告中國形勢，宣道會總會評估中共在短期內會南下接管香港，決定不在香港設立宣教據點，只設立臨時性的「宣道會全中國辦事處」（All-China Alliance Office），臨時辦事處只運作三年多，至1953年4月美國總會同意建立「中國－香港宣教區」（China-Hong Kong Field）為止。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nThe primary opposition and impact on Christianity during this decade occurred mainly during the Japanese occupation period. Please refer to the text below for further details.\n\n此十年主要反對及衝擊基督教者，主要是日治淪陷時期，參下文 \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nDuring this decade, the main opposition to and impact on Christianity primarily took place during the Japanese occupation period. Please see the text below for further details.\n\n此十年主要反對及衝擊基督教者，主要是日治淪陷時期，參下文。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n(1) The St. Stephen’s College Massacre (Banham 2003: 248-276; Chen Tianquan 2024: 100-103)\n\nSt. Stephen’s College was founded in 1903 by the Anglican Church in Sai Ying Pun. In 1928, the school relocated to Stanley, with its new campus situated on the site of the former Stanley Barracks. During the Battle of Hong Kong and the subsequent occupation, St. Stephen’s College became a significant chapter in this tumultuous history.\n\nOn December 22, British forces retreated to Stanley, fighting bitterly until December 25, when the defensive line fell. In the early hours of Christmas Day, Japanese forces stormed St. Stephen’s College. Despite the building displaying the Red Cross flag, the Japanese troops massacred over 60 wounded soldiers and medical staff inside. Female nurses were subjected to horrific assaults, including rape. Among the victims was Tan Cheung-Hsuen, the Head of the Chinese Language Department, an alumnus of the school who had enrolled at the University of Hong Kong in 1918, attended the World’s Student Christian Federation Conference in Beijing in 1922, and began teaching at St. Stephen’s in 1924. Remaining at the school during the war, he was brutally killed at the age of 41. His body was initially buried in Stanley Village and later reinterred in the Stanley Military Cemetery after the war.\n\n\n(2) The Reverend Chang Chu-Ling “Spy” Case (Chen Zhiheng 1999: 208-223)\n\nReverend Chang Chu-Ling was the senior pastor of the Union Church of the Chinese Christian Church. From May 1942 to March 1945, Japanese military police conducted 15 investigations into the Union Church, focusing on its history, financial assets, congregation size, and leadership. On October 21, 1943, a secret agent summoned Reverend Chang to the Western District Gendarmerie for questioning. Though this was not his first summons, this time he was detained and accused of being a spy for the Chongqing Nationalist Government.\n\nDuring his 19-day imprisonment, Chang was interrogated 11 times and subjected to severe torture, including beatings, being suspended upside down, whipped with thick belts, and deprived of water for over 30 hours. Facing such torment, he relied on prayer for strength.\n\nAfter Reverend Chang’s disappearance, the General Assembly’s advisor, Pastor Sawajima, sought his whereabouts and negotiated with Colonel Noma, the head of the Japanese military police. Chang later recounted that he was suspected of being an Anglo-American spy due to his fiery sermons, criticism of Japan’s hostile mindset, and frequent preaching of the gospel of peace, which was perceived as opposition to the “holy war.” He was also suspected of assisting people in returning to their hometowns. Even after his release, the Union Church remained under investigation. Chang required over 20 days of treatment to recover, though his hands, damaged from hanging, left him unable to fully extend his fingers. This pain persisted for years, particularly before storms.\n\nAt the time of his imprisonment, Reverend Chang was 66 years old. The ordeal inflicted lasting physical and mental trauma. He retired from the Union Church in September 1950 but continued to serve as an advisory pastor until his passing in 1961.\n\n\n(3) Christianity in Detention Camps (Ho Wing-Kei 2111: 179-194; Chen Zhiheng 1999: 313-338; Fetzer & Soper 2015)\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese army detained over 10,000 foreign nationals from “enemy countries” in various camps. Foreign Christians in Hong Kong were no exception. For example, the Stanley Internment Camp, located in the southern part of Hong Kong Island, housed approximately 2,400 British nationals, 300 Americans, and over 60 Dutch nationals. Among them were 40 pastors and missionaries from over 20 denominations, including the Anglican Church (from Britain, Ireland, Scotland, and the U.S.), Presbyterian Church (from Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.), Southern Baptist Convention, Salvation Army, Methodist Church, Lutheran Church, Seventh-Day Adventists, Assemblies of God, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Congregational Church, Religious Society of Friends, and Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn his memoir Too Hot for Comfort, British Methodist missionary Bill Ream recalled religious life in the Stanley Internment Camp. On January 25, 1942, the first Sunday worship service was held in the college hall. The morning and afternoon services were attended by over 300 and 100-200 people, respectively. In these harsh conditions, believers of various traditions united, with Free Church pastors assisting in Anglican Eucharist ceremonies and sermons delivered by pastors from different denominations. In addition to worship, the camp offered Sunday school for children and adults, later expanding to include youth services and teacher training programs. Morning prayers were held daily at 8:30 a.m., alternating between Anglican, Free Church, and litany prayers.\n\nSpecial gatherings were held on Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter. In September 1943, the camp hosted a week-long gospel campaign themed “Quo Vadis?” (“Where are you going?”). Bill Ream noted that, at the time, American and Canadian detainees were gradually repatriated, leaving those still interned uncertain about their future, making the theme especially poignant. In August 1944, a blackout prompted spontaneous gatherings in the camp, where believers shared scriptures and prayed together in the dark.\n\nHowever, unity was occasionally challenged. In April 1942, some American left-wing evangelicals insisted on holding separate services, which Ream described as a “traumatic experience.” While the religious services in the internment camp brought together different traditions, they did not constitute a formal “United Church” but rather “United Congregations.”\n\nThe altar for the joint worship services featured a golden cross that had once adorned the entrance of Mount Gough Peak Protestant Church (built in 1883), which was destroyed during the Battle of Hong Kong. Pastors carried the cross to the Stanley Internment Camp, and after the war, it was relocated to St. John’s Cathedral. In September 1958, on Michaelmas, the cross was presented to St. Stephen’s Church in Stanley, with an inscription commemorating its history.\n\nAdditionally, in a chapel at the Sham Shui Po Prisoner-of-War Camp, detainees created an altar using a box lid and a cross salvaged from a garbage heap. The altar bore the prayer of St. Richard of Chichester:\n\n\"Thanks be to my Lord Jesus Christ, for all the blessings Thou hast given me,For all the pains and insults Thou hast borne for me.O most merciful Redeemer, Friend, and Brother,May I know Thee more clearly, love Thee more dearly, and follow Thee more nearly, day by day. Amen.\"\n\nAfter the war, the altar was moved to the Chapel of St. Michael the Archangel in St. John’s Cathedral.\n\n\n(1)聖士提反書院大屠殺（Banham 2003: 248-276；陳天權2024：100-103）\n\n\n聖士提反書院於1903年由聖公會於西營盤創校。1928年遷至赤柱，新校址正是昔日赤柱軍營舊址。在香港保衛戰及淪陷期間，聖士提反書院成為這段不平凡歷史中的重要一章。\n\n\n12月22日，英軍退守赤柱，苦戰至12月25日防線失守。聖誕日凌晨，日軍攻入聖士提反書院，竟在已懸掛紅十字旗的書院大樓內屠殺傷兵及醫護六十多人，甚至有女護士慘遭日軍姦殺。其中聖士提反書院中文科主任譚長萱（該校校友，1918年入讀香港大學，1922年出席北京世界基督徒學生同盟大會，1924年起任教聖士提反書院），在戰爭期間留守學校，亦慘遭殺害，享年41歲。譚氏遺體葬於赤柱村內，戰後移葬至赤柱軍人墳場。\n\n\n(2) 張祝齡「間諜」案（陳智衡1999：208-223）\n\n\n張祝齡牧師是中華基督教會合一堂的主任牧師。自1942年5月至1945年3日間，日本憲兵合共調查合一堂達15次之多，調查內容涉及建堂歷史，財務資產、會友人數及領袖個人資料等。1943年10月21日，密偵到合一堂傳召張祝齡到西區憲兵部問話，這不是首次傳召，但結果張卻被羈留，並指他是重慶國民政府的間謀。在囚禁19天時間內，他被審問11次之多，並受到酷刑折磨（拳打腳踢、背手倒吊、高懸空際、以厚皮帶鞭打……），期間曾30多小時滴水不沾。面對獄中折磨，張只有依靠禱告。\n\n\n當張祝齡「失縱」後，總會顧問鮫島牧師四處查探，始得悉其下落，並跟憲兵最高負責人野間大佐交涉。關於張被日本憲兵扣查的原因，主要就是認定他是英美間諜，後來張自述：「平日講道，言辭激烈，有譏誚日本的敵性心意，而且常講和平的福音，有意反對聖戰，並且疑惑我暗助民眾還鄉」。獲釋後，憲兵仍多次調查合一堂，而張經過20多天治療，始漸康復。但手部因被倒吊，手指不能伸直，風雨前夕手筋作痛，持續多年。無論如何，張祝齡被囚時，已達66歲，事件無論如何對他亦構成身心創傷。1950年9月，張祝齡牧師自合一堂退休，仍任顧問牧師，1961年離世。\n\n\n(3) 拘留營中的基督教（何穎琪2111：179-194；陳智衡1999：313-338；Fetzer & Soper 2015）\n\n\n香港淪陷期間，日軍合共俘虜了一萬多名「敵國」外僑，分別送入各拘留營中。在港的外籍基督徒，也無一倖免。就以位於香港島南區的赤柱拘留營為例，扣留了大約有2400名英國人、300名美國人及60多名荷蘭人。其中包括40位牧師及傳道，基督徒背景涉及20多個宗派：聖公會（英國、愛爾蘭、蘇格蘭、美國）、長老會（愛爾蘭、紐西蘭、美國）、浸信會（美南、紐西蘭）、救世軍、衛理公會、路德會、循道會、安息日會、神召會、宣道會、公理會、公誼會、天主教等等。\n\n\n英國循道公會傳教士李惠霖（Bill Ream）在其回憶錄Too Hot for Comfort中，憶述赤柱拘留營內的宗教生活。1942年1月25日，書院禮堂舉行首次主日崇拜。早、午堂崇拜分別有300多人及100至200人出席在艱難環境下，不同宗派傳統信徒作出合一見證，如聖餐採用聖公會禮儀時，則由自由教會（Free Church）牧者襄禮，證道牧師亦由不同宗派牧師負責。除崇拜外，營內亦有兒童及成人主日學，後來發展出青少年崇拜，及主日學老師培訓班。每天早上八時半又有按聖公宗、自由教會、連禱文（Litany prayer）輪流舉行的晨禱會。\n\n\n聖誕節、受難節及復活節時，又有特別聚會。1943年9月，赤柱拘留營更舉行為期一周以「你往哪裡去？」（Quo Vadis?）為主題的福音運動。李惠霖指出，當時營內美加籍國民先後獲遣送回國，對仍然在囚者而言，看不到前面的路向，故有關主題有極大意義。1944年8月，拘留營整天停電，有信徒在晚上自發聚會，在黑暗中分享經文，一起禱告。不過，合一工作也受到挑戰。1942年4月，好些美國左翼福音派（left-wing evangelical）信徒堅持自行聚會，此舉被李惠霖形容為一次「創痛經驗」（traumatic experience）。扣留營內的宗教聚會雖然容納了不同宗派傳統，但嚴格而言，也不等同「聯合教會」（United Church），而只是聯合會眾 （United Congregations）。\n\n聯合崇拜聖壇有一金色十字架，原置於山頂教堂（Mt. Gough Peak Protestant Church, 1883）門廊頂。香港保衛戰期間，教堂遭日軍炸毀。教會牧者將十字架帶至赤柱拘留營。戰後，山頂教堂不擬重建，十字架移至聖約翰座堂。1958年9月米迦勒（Michaelmas）將此十字架送贈赤柱聖士提反堂（十字架後有刻文誌念）。\n\n\n此外，在深水埗集中營的小教堂內，戰俘用盒蓋及從垃圾堆中找到的十字架來製造可供崇拜的祭壇，祭壇上刻有聖理查 （Richard of Chichester） 的禱文：「感謝我的主耶穌基督，賜福給我並為我承受痛苦及侮辱。最滿有慈愛之救贖主，友⼈及弟兄，讓我更清楚認識你，更親切的愛你，更貼近地跟隨你，天天如是，阿⾨」──聖理查Richard of Chichester(1197 – 1253)。戰後，這本刻祭壇移至聖約翰座堂內的天使長聖米迦勒堂。 ",
