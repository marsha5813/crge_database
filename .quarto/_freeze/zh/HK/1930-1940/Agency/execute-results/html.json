Initially, he ministered in Hunan and later taught at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Hubei. In 1905, during a visit to a major Buddhist monastery on Mount Weishan, he envisioned a reformation of Western missionary methods and a new mission strategy for evangelizing Buddhists. In 1921, he founded the Christian Mission to Buddhists in China (CMB) to foster dialogue between Christianity and Buddhism.\n\nIn 1922, Reichelt established the Jingfengshan Christian Monastery in Nanjing. Between 1922 and 1927, the monastery hosted 5,000 Buddhist monks, 50 of whom converted to Christianity. However, during the Northern Expedition in 1927, anti-foreign sentiment led to the destruction of Jingfengshan. Reichelt temporarily relocated to Hangzhou and established the Tianfengshan Monastery but eventually decided to leave China.\n\nIn 1929, Reichelt moved to Hong Kong, and in 1930, he purchased a site in Sha Tin, naming it Tao Fong Shan (Mountain of the Christ Wind). He invited Danish architect Johannes Prip-Møller to design the monastery buildings in the style of Chinese Buddhist temples. By 1932, a series of buildings with distinct Chinese characteristics were completed, and missionary work targeting Buddhist monks gradually began at Tao Fong Shan.\n\nReichelt maintained a close relationship with Bishop Ronald O. Hall of the Anglican Church in Hong Kong. Bishop Hall admired the tranquil environment of Tao Fong Shan and chose to reside in the Ling Yim Terrace on the mountain rather than the Central District bishop’s residence. In 1934, Hall presided over the dedication ceremony of the Jingzun Treasure Hall.\n\nTao Fong Shan placed great emphasis on literary missionary work, using publications to promote its vision. In 1934, it launched the journal Tao Fong, publishing two issues annually. The journal ceased publication during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong but resumed in 1948. The journal primarily explored theological perspectives on the relationship between Christianity and other religions and included records of lectures aligned with the monastery’s mission.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Hubei decided to relocate to Hong Kong. Classes resumed at Tao Fong Shan in December 1948, with Reichelt assisting in teaching. He passed away in March 1952 in Hong Kong and was buried in the Christian Monastery Cemetery at Tao Fong Shan. Reichelt’s notable works include Introduction to Religion (1931), The Transformed Abbot (1954, 1959), Truth and Tradition in Chinese Buddhism: A Study of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism (1934), Religion in Chinese Garment (1951), and Meditation and Piety in the Far East: A Religious-Psychological Study (1953).\n\n\n(2) Ronald O. Hall (Paton 1985; Chan-Yeung 2015; 吴青 2017)\n\nRonald O. Hall (1895–1975) served as the seventh bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Victoria (1932–1966). A native of Newcastle, England, Hall graduated from Oxford University in 1920 and was ordained as a curate. He later served as pastor at St. John’s Church in Lambeth. In 1922, Hall first visited China to attend the World Christian Student Federation annual meeting in Beijing.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1926, Hall worked as a secretary for the YMCA in Shanghai, where he met Gu Ziren, a leader of the Christian student movement. Gu gave Hall the Chinese name \"Ho Ming Wah,\" meaning \"light to China,\" reflecting Hall's mission. In 1927, Hall returned to England and served as rector of St. Luke’s Church in Newcastle.\n\nIn 1932, Hall was elected Bishop of Victoria. He was consecrated at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London in October and assumed his position in Hong Kong in December. In 1933, during the 12th Synod of the Diocese of Victoria held in Guangzhou, Hall advocated for appointing a Chinese assistant bishop to promote church autonomy. He also proposed that future church buildings adopt traditional Chinese architectural styles. In 1934, at St. John’s Cathedral in Hong Kong, Hall consecrated Mok Sau Tseng as the first Chinese assistant bishop of South China. Under Hall’s leadership, two new churches were constructed in the 1930s—Holy Trinity Church and St. Mary’s Church—both designed in Chinese styles.\n\nAfter World War II, Hall was instrumental in establishing several social welfare organizations, including the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, the Hong Kong Children’s Reception Centre, St. James’ Settlement, the Hong Kong Family Welfare Society, the Boy Scouts, and the Hong Kong Housing Society. He also led the Anglican Church’s efforts to address the shortage of school places by establishing 19 primary schools and 8 secondary schools between 1950 and 1966, as well as founding vocational training schools. Hall played a key role in the establishment of Chung Chi College, which later became part of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nHall’s tenure lasted 34 years, spanning the significant transition of 1949 when the People’s Republic of China was established. During this time, Hall reorganized the diocese, transforming the Diocese of Victoria and Canton into the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau. His term also saw controversies, such as the ordination of the first female Anglican priest, Li Tim Oi, and his 1956 visit to China.\n\nHall received two honorary medals from the Nationalist Government and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1965, the University of Hong Kong awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in recognition of his contributions to Hong Kong society.\n\nHall retired in 1966 and passed away in Oxford, England, in April 1975. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\n(1) John Sung’s Revival Meetings (Levi 1995: 110, 116-117, 210-211, 261)\n\nJohn Sung (1901–1944) was a renowned evangelist in modern China. In the 1930s, he conducted four revival meetings in Hong Kong.\n\nThe first meeting, held from March 6 to 12, 1932, at the Bethel Mission, featured instances such as \"many preachers and Bible school students confessing their sins to one another and seeking forgiveness.\" One notable event was a \"disobedient son reconciling with his mother and praying together.\" This meeting was part of the Bethel Evangelistic Band’s South China tour. After leaving Hong Kong, they traveled to Guangzhou, Wuzhou, Guixian, and Yulin. Sung returned to Hong Kong from Guangzhou for another session from April 28 to May 8, also at the Bethel Mission, where 32 individuals requested baptism. Later, he led study groups at the Methodist Church and hosted a citywide union meeting at the Hop Yat Church. During this visit, he prayed for the ailing wife of Lin Hu, shared his message at the Xinguang Blind School, and, at the invitation of Zhang Jisheng, preached to over a hundred workers at the Anleyuan Biscuit Factory, leading many to tears of repentance.\n\nFrom June 14 to 25, 1936, Sung returned to Hong Kong and was hosted by Lin Zifeng. His sermons on the “Church of Laodicea” criticized Hong Kong churches for \"failing to shine for the Lord and squandering God's grace.\" He remarked that \"many have time to make coffins but no time to shine for the Lord as witnesses.\" Responding to Sung's call, 50 evangelistic teams were formed, with Lin Zifeng elected as their leader. Upon Sung's departure, 200 people gathered at the pier to sing hymns as they bid him farewell.\n\nFrom May 13 to 18, 1938, Sung held meetings at Minsheng Academy in Kowloon, where \"117 people experienced spiritual blessings, 164 individuals received the laying on of hands, and 21 new evangelistic teams were formed.\"\n\n\n(2) Indigenous Church Architecture (Xing Fuzeng and Liu Shaolin 2010: 71-74; Wei Keli and Chen Ruiwen 2014: 89-100; Lung Ping-yee 1992: 129)\n\nIn 1932, when Ronald O. Hall was appointed as the seventh Bishop of the Diocese of Victoria (Diocese of Hong Kong and South China), he envisioned that future church architecture should adopt a Chinese style externally while incorporating foreign designs internally.\n\nIn 1933, when the Hong Kong government informed the Anglican Church that the land for Holy Trinity Church in Kowloon City would be reclaimed for leveling Victoria Peak, Hall supported rebuilding Holy Trinity Church using Chinese architectural styles. Churches with traditional Chinese architectural features could be seen as \"China's Renaissance.\" The emergence of such churches was closely tied to the 20th-century Christian indigenization movement. Professor Lung Ping-yee from the Department of Architecture at the University of Hong Kong noted, “During the 1920s, the 'Anti-Christian' or 'Anti-Religion' movements in China resisted Western religious ideologies. By the 1930s, Chinese churches were established with strong patriotic religious sentiments, seeking independence not only in liturgy and theology but also in administration and finances. Consequently, church buildings began adopting Chinese designs to align with the principles of 'self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance.'” Ronald O. Hall was a key advocate for this “Sinicized” church architecture. As a British missionary, Hall continuously sought ways to harmonize Christianity with Chinese society and culture.\n\nIn 1930, Norwegian missionary Karl Ludvig Reichelt from the Christian Mission to Buddhists founded Tao Fong Shan in Sha Tin. The monastery was designed entirely in the style of a Buddhist temple, aiming to create a dialogue space between Christianity and Buddhism and guide monks to Christ. Hall greatly admired Reichelt’s vision and efforts. Hall’s advocacy for combining Chinese architectural styles with Christian sanctuaries was likely inspired by Reichelt.\n\nDuring Hall’s tenure, two Anglican churches rebuilt in Hong Kong, Holy Trinity Church and St. Mary’s Church, adopted Chinese architectural styles. Both were designed by Ng Kin-chung.\n\nAdditionally, in 1930s Hong Kong, the South China Regional Seminary (1931) of the Catholic Church adopted classical Chinese architectural patterns. The original design was intended as a courtyard-style complex. However, due to economic constraints, the wings and upper stories of the main building were omitted, leaving only the south wing completed (Lam Se-ling 2010: 177-179).\n\n\n(1) 宋尚節香港佈道會 John Sung’s  Revival Meetings（利未1995：110、16-117、210-211、261）\n\n\n宋尚節（1901-1944）是近代中國著名佈道家。他在三十年代曾四次來港主領佈道會。第一次（1932年3月6至12日）在便以利會領會，「許多傳道人及聖經學院學生彼此認罪互求饒恕」，更令一位「不孝子」與母親和好，一起禱告。這次是伯特利佈道團的華南巡迴佈道，離開香港後到廣州、梧州、貴縣、玉林。然後在4月28至5月8日再次由廣州抵港，在便以利會聚會有32人要求受浸。後來，他又到循道會領查組，及到合一堂領全港聯合大會。期間曾到林護家為其患病妻子禱告。又到心光盲人院分享，及應張吉盛邀請到他創辦的安樂園餅乾廠為百多名工人講道 ，眾人流淚認罪。\n\n\n1936年6月14至25日，宋抵港後，由林子豐接待，後以「老底嘉教會」為題，批評香港教會「不能為主發光，真虧負了神的恩典。許多人有時間忙於發棺材，但沒有時間為主發光作見證」。在宋呼籲下，香港成立了50隊佈道團，林子豐被選為團長。他離港時，200人在碼頭唱詩告別。\n\n\n1938年5月13至18日，他在九龍民生書院聚會，「一百一十七人蒙恩，為一百六十四人按手，增加二十一個佈道隊」。\n\n\n(2) 本色化建築 Indigenous Church Architecture（邢福增、劉紹麟 2010：71-74；魏克利、陳睿文2014：89-100；龍炳頤1992：129）\n\n\n1932年，何明華（Ronald O. Hall）就任維多利亞教區（港粵教區）第七任主教後，期望日後教會禮拜堂之建築款式，外面宜用中國形式，內面可採用外國款式。1933年香港府通知聖公會教區議會須收回九龍城聖三一堂地段，以便夷平維多利亞山後，何明華即支持以中國建築風格興建聖三一堂。具傳統中國建築特色的教堂，可視作「中國的文藝復興」。富中國傳統建築特色的教堂的出現，跟20世紀基督教的本色化（Indigenization）運動有密切關係。香港大學建築系龍炳頤教授指出：「在本世紀二十年代，中國國內產生了『非基』運動或『反教』運動，對西方傳入的宗教思想作出全面抗拒，而三十年代建立的中國人自己的教會，卻帶有濃厚的愛國宗教思想，它不只是在禮儀上、神學上有所改變，甚至在行政上、經濟上也要獨立，於是教堂的建築形式也實行中國化，以配合『自養、自傳、自治』的路向。」何明華正是這種「中國化」教堂的主要推手。作為英國傳教士，如何融合基督教能與中國社會、文化是他一直的期許。1930年，挪威籍的道友會（Christian Mission to Buddhists）傳教士艾香德（Karl Ludvig Reicheld）在沙田道風山創辦基督教叢林，便完全採取佛教寺院的設計，希望可以在基督教與佛教間建立對話空間，進而引領僧侶皈信。何明華十分欣賞艾氏的異象與努力，何氏主張把中國建築風格與基督教聖堂結合，未嘗不是受到艾香德的啟迪。在他任內，香港聖公會兩所同期重建的聖堂（聖三一堂及聖瑪利亞堂），均採用中國特色的建築風格，由吳建中設計。\n\n\n1930年代香港，尚有天主教華南總修院（1931），同樣採用中式古典建築方格，原設計是四合院式建築，但最後因經濟原因，取消了主樓的兩翼及屋頂高樓，只建成了主樓（南樓）（林社鈴2010：177-179）。 \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n(1) Dialogue and Controversy Between Christianity and Buddhism (Tong Wing-Sze 2019: 287-294; Li Zhihao 2006: 139-177)\n\nAfter its establishment in 1930, the Tao Fong Shan Christian Monastery initiated inter-religious dialogues in Hong Kong, particularly between Christianity and Buddhism. In its early years, Buddhist monks were the primary audience for its evangelistic efforts, and missionaries offered religious lecture courses to visitors. The founder of Sha Tin's Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery (established in 1957), Master Yuet Kai, visited Tao Fong Shan in 1933 as the 38th visiting monk (Huang Dicai 2015).\n\nIn the inaugural issue of Tao Fong, Karl Ludvig Reichelt wrote, “Jesus Christ is not merely a sage of one nation, one ethnicity, or one era. He is the eternal Word, without beginning or end, self-existent and everlasting, the foundation of all things, and the source of all life... From this abundant 'Word' flows endless living water—some in large streams, some in small streams, some belonging to the East, and some to the West. Each nation and sect, according to their unique forms, flows from this one 'Word,' ultimately returning to one truth. It is the hope of this publication that people of all nations and sects may freely drink from this vast spring and benefit from the fullness of the 'Word.'”\n\nThe monastery’s Tao Fong Shan Institute of Religious Studies welcomed both Christians from mainland China and a number of Buddhist and Taoist individuals to engage in discussions on religious truth. Visitors from various religious traditions, including Buddhist monks and laypeople, often engaged in dialogue or even debate about Christian beliefs with those at the monastery. For example, one monk named Liaoyi, who transitioned from Tibetan Buddhism to Zen Buddhism, studied the Bible at Tao Fong Shan and discussed the concept of salvation in Christianity with Reverend Wong King Hing. Liaoyi regarded Jesus as a sage but questioned how Jesus fulfilled the plan to redeem humanity.\n\nReichelt’s inculturation approach, which included elements of Buddhism, inevitably drew criticism from the broader Christian community, with accusations of syncretism. For instance, the original name of the chapel, \"Jingzun Bao Dian\" (Hall of Revered Scenery), was misunderstood by some to refer to a Buddhist deity. In 1945, Reverend Wong King Hing renamed the hall as the \"Sanctuary\" (Sheng Dian). The couplet inscribed on either side of the hall, which originally read \"The divine light shines universally; the great vow guides the compassionate vessel,\" was changed to \"The Word was with God; the wind blows wherever it pleases.\" These modifications aimed to address external critiques of Tao Fong Shan’s practices and maintain its Christian identity.\n\n\n(1)耶佛對話與爭議（湯泳詩2019：287-294；李智浩2006：139-177）\n\n\n道風山基督教叢林在1930年創立後，開啟了香港宗教之間，特別是基督教與佛教的對話。早年以佛教僧侶為主要傳教對象，傳教士為眾來訪者提供宗教講座課程。創建沙田萬佛寺(1957) 的主持— 月溪法師，曾於1933年訪問道風山，是為第38位到訪僧侶 (黃棣才2015)。\n\n\n艾香德在《道風》，發刊詞中說：「耶穌基督不是一國一族一時代的聖賢，乃是太初的大道，無始無終，自有永有，萬物的根本，眾生的泉源……從這充滿的『道』，要流出無窮的活水，有的大流，有的小流，有的屬乎東方，有的屬乎西方，從各民族各宗派按著他們原有的格式，在一個『道』中流出，仍就歸於一個真理，使各民族各宗派的人，都能放懷暢飲這寬闊的泉源，都能從豐滿的『道』中得益，這是本刊的盼望。」叢林設有道風山宗教研究院，除收錄來自內地的基督徒外，又有若干佛家及道家人士，共同研討宗教真理。\n\n來訪道風山的教教和佛教會侶及居士，跟叢林中人就基督教信仰問題展開交流甚至辯論，例如有一位「了義」法師，由密宗轉入禪宗，在山上讀畢聖經，與王景慶牧師討論基督教的救恩問題，認為耶穌可視為聖人，卻質疑耶穌如何完成救贖人類的計劃。\n\n\n艾香德具佛教化的本色化實踐，難免引起教會的非議，指其乃宗教混合主義（syncretism）。對此，原本名「景尊寶殿」的禮堂，卻被人誤會「景尊」為佛教的神，到1945年王景慶牧師改為「聖殿」，殿兩旁的對聯「靈光普耀，大願慈航」，則改為「道與上帝同在，風隨意思吹」。上述改變，旨在回應外界對道風山的抨擊。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian leaders.\n\n此十年間未有明顯的反基督教領袖 \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年間未有明顯的反基督教組織 \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nDuring this decade, there were no significant anti-Christian incidents or movements.\n\n此十年間未有明顯的反基督教事件/運動 ",
