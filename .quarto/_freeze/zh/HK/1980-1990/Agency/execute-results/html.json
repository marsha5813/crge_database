During his childhood, he studied at various schools before transferring to Queen’s College in Form Three. In 1960, he entered the Faculty of Arts at the University of Hong Kong, majoring in philosophy. During his university years, he began serving in the church by teaching Sunday school and participated in the Student Christian Movement, though he also had contact with the Hong Kong University Christian Fellowship.\n\n\nAfter graduating from HKU, Kwok pursued theological studies at Yale Divinity School in the U.S. in 1963. During his time there, he interned at the United Church of Christ and was ordained as a pastor on June 12, 1966, at Centre Church On The Green. He had decided to return to Hong Kong before completing his studies, leaving the U.S. immediately after his graduation ceremony on June 13, 1966.\n\n\nIn August 1966, Kwok began serving as the pastor of Shum Oi Church in Shek Kip Mei, where he became aware of various social injustices and reflected on how the church could better serve the community. In January 1978, he transitioned to serve as the General Secretary of the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC). Starting in 1979, he also took on the role of Director of the Hong Kong Christian Service, succeeding Pastor Karl L. Stumpf until April 1988.\n\n\nIn November 1980, HKCC convened a consultation on the church’s mission for the 1980s, followed by a mid-decade consultation in 1986. Five agenda items were outlined:  \n\n1. Addressing political reform and the drafting of the Basic Law.  \n\n2. Promoting civic education.  \n\n3. Caring for the poor and safeguarding livelihoods.  \n\n4. Encouraging church renewal.  \n\n5. Strengthening church cooperation.  \n\n\nIn November 1986, Kwok attended the High Mountain Conference, advocating for Hong Kong to be governed democratically. Under his leadership, HKCC actively engaged in public affairs and campaigned for democratic progress, drawing criticism from Chinese authorities. Internal disagreements emerged within HKCC, and Kwok stepped down in September 1988, resolving the disputes.\n\n\nAfter leaving HKCC, Kwok founded the Hong Kong Christian Institute in April 1988, providing a platform for Christians concerned about Hong Kong’s future. He served as its General Secretary until his retirement in 2000. During this time, he led the Institute through significant events, including the 1989 Tiananmen protests, the promulgation of the Basic Law, the transitional controversies, and the 1997 handover of Hong Kong. Kwok criticized the church for allocating excessive resources to social services during the 1960s and 1970s, which, in his view, led to the loss of its prophetic voice. He also noted that the church’s relationship with the government had become one of mutual exploitation, undermining its ability to critique societal issues. He foresaw the challenge of \"recolonization\" post-1997.\n\n\nKwok remained a prolific writer, reflecting on issues facing the Hong Kong church. His works include Seeking a Common Path: The Mission of the Church Before 1997 (1990), 1997: A Christian Perspective (1991), Praying for the Peace of This City (1993), The Cry for Justice (1993), Hong Kong Braves 1997 (1994), Towards a Renewed Church (1995), 1997: Hong Kong's Struggle for Selfhood (1996), Hong Kong at the Edge of Recolonization (1996), The Call for Humanity (1997), A Church in Transition (1997), An Exploration of Social Theology (1998), The Gospel of John (1998), The Gospel of Mark: The Light of the Cross (1999), Modern Spirituality (1999), Hong Kong Churches Towards the New Century (1999), Hong Kong After 1997: The First 1000 Days (2000), and Strategies for Renewing Local Churches (2000).\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) James Cheung Mo-Oi （張美萍2018；梁家麟1999）\n\n\nJames Cheung Mo-Oi (1941–2017), originally from Puning, Guangdong, was born in Hong Kong. During the Japanese occupation, his family moved to Shantou. In 1949, after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, they returned to Hong Kong. He attended services at Kowloon City Life Church during his youth and graduated from Methodist School and Wah Yan College, Kowloon.  \n\n\nIn 1965, Cheung pursued higher education in English literature at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, where he participated in the Chinese Alliance Church of Saskatoon. After graduating in 1967, he pursued theological studies at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Chicago, earning an M.A. in Theology and an M.Div. He later enrolled in the doctoral program at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Texas, completing the required coursework in 1973. He began teaching at Canadian Bible College (later renamed Canadian Theological Seminary) while continuing work on his dissertation, which he completed in 1975.\n\n\nIn 1979, during a sabbatical, Cheung returned to Hong Kong to teach at China Graduate School of Theology and assist his father-in-law, Pastor Cheung Yau Kwong, at Kowloon City Baptist Church. After his sabbatical, he returned to Canada. However, Pastor Stephen Tong invited him to serve as the President of Alliance Bible Seminary in Hong Kong, a position he assumed in 1980.\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Alliance Bible Seminary underwent significant growth, including establishing a sacred music department (1983), external studies (1985), and master's programs such as M.Div. (1989). Research initiatives expanded in the 1990s, with the establishment of the Center for the Study of Christianity and Chinese Culture (1993) and the publication of The Journal of Alliance Bible Seminary (1994). Cheung also oversaw campus expansions and the establishment of a new urban campus in Wan Chai.\n\n\nIn addition to theological education, Cheung served as Senior Pastor of Kowloon City Baptist Church from 1990 to 2006. Under his leadership, the church expanded its ministries, launching missions, elder and youth centers, and an adult development center.\n\n\nCheung was also a prolific writer. His publications include The Ecclesiology of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee (1972), Miracles, Healing, Exorcism, and Evangelism, Contemporary Pentecostal Movement: Issues to Watch, The Book of Joshua: Spiritual Battles in a Great Era, and others. From 1979 to 2007, he frequently spoke at the Kowloon and Hong Kong Bible Conferences.\n\n\nCheung passed away in November 2017, aged 76.\n\n(1)郭乃弘 Kwok Nai Wang（郭乃弘 2004）\n\n\n郭乃弘(1938-)，生於基督化家庭，自幼隨父母參與中華基督教會公理堂聚會。童年先後在多所學就讀，最後轉至皇仁書院升讀中三。1960年入讀香港大學文學院，主修哲學，並開始在教會事奉，任教主日學，在學期間參與港大的基督徒學生運動（Student Christian Movement），但也有接觸港大團契。港大畢業後，1963年赴美國耶魯大學神學院進修神學，期間於美國聯合基督教會（United Church of Christ, USA）實習，畢業後（1966年6月12日）於中央教堂（Centre Church On The Green）被按立為牧師。由於他早於畢業前便決定回香港事奉，所以在6月13日畢業禮結束後即離美經歐洲回港。\n\n\n1966年8月起，任中華基督教會深愛堂主任。深愛堂位於石硤尾徙置區，令他認識到社會各種不公義的問題，得不反省教會如何服事社區。1978年1月起，郭轉任香港基督教協進會總幹事。1979年起，兼任基督教服務處主任，接替退休的施同福（Karl L. Stumpf）牧師，至1988年4月卸任。\n\n\n1980年11月，協進會召開八十年代教會使命諮詢會議，86年再召開八十年代中期的使命諮詢會議，並擬定五個課題作為議程：（1）關注政制改革及基本法草擬；（2）推廣公民教育；（3）關懷貧苦，保障民生；（4）推動堂會更新，（5）加強教會合作。\n\n\n1986年11月，郭乃弘出席高山大會，發言時表達對港人以民主方式治理香港的訴求。由於協進會在郭帶領下積極關注香港公共事務，並爭取加快民主進程，結果引起中方的不滿。協進會內部出現路線分歧，到1988年9月郭乃弘離開協進會，爭議才結一段落。\n\n\n離開協進會後，郭在1988年4月創辦香港基督徒學會，作為凝聚一群關心香港前途的基督徒可以繼續發聲的平台。他出任學會總幹事，至2000年退休。期間帶領學會經歷八九民運、基本法頒佈，後過渡期爭議以至九七主權移交。他曾批評香港教會在六、七十年代把大量資源投入社會服務，結果付上了喪失社會良知身分的沉重代價，並認為由於教會與政府間密立了互相利用的關係，最終使教會失去了能夠提出社會批判的位置。至於那些被視為香港教會對社會作出的貢獻，只不過「在於對社會上產生的問題作出補救、治理，卻沒有追溯問題產生的根源。這是一種治標不治本的社會參與」。早於在1997年前，他已提出1997後，香港面對「再殖民地化」的挑戰。\n\n\n郭乃弘在積極關心社會之餘，亦不忘著述，反省香港教會問題：《共覓前路：九七當前的教會使命》（1990）、1997: A Christian Perspective (1991)、《為這城求平安》（1993）、《公義的呼喊》（1993）、 Hong Kong Braves 1997 (1994)、《共闖明天：讓地方教會重新得力》（1995）、1997: Hong Kong Struggle for Selfhood (1996)、《再殖代邊緣的香港》（1996）、《人性的呼喚》（1997）、A Church in Transition (1997)、《關社神學初探》（1998）、《約翰福音》（1998）、《馬可福音──十架的光輝》（1999）、《現代人的靈修》上下（1999）、《邁向新世紀的香港教會》（1999）、Hong Kong after 1997: The First 1000 Days (2000)、《更新地方教會的策略》（2000）。\n\n\n(2)張慕皚 James Cheung  Mo-Oi （張美萍2018：24-25；張美萍、鄭坤英2018：26；梁家麟1999：307-308、314-316、320-321、323-327）\n\n\n張慕皚（1941-2017），廣東普寧人，生於香港。香港淪陷期間，舉家移居汕頭。1949年中共建國後，由汕頭回到香港。幼時參加九龍城生命堂聚會，先後於循道小學及九龍華仁書院畢業。1965年赴加拿大沙省（Saskatoon ）University of Saskatchewan升學，主修英國文學，期間參與雷城華人宣道會聚會。1967年大學畢業後，赴美國芝加哥三一神學院深造，先後獲取文學碩士（MA in Theology） 及神道學碩士（M.

In 1962, he fled to Hong Kong. During the 1970s, he participated in the \"Movement to Establish Chinese as an Official Language\" and the Diaoyu Islands defense movement. He later joined the Industrial Committee and began working as a journalist for Workers' Weekly, marking the start of his involvement in labor movements. From the 1980s, Lau became an active figure in Hong Kong's labor movement, serving as Director of the Christian Industrial Committee (CIC) from 1980 to 2006. In 1981, he founded the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims. In 1990, he organized a new labor union federation, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU), and became its founding chairman.  \n\n\nIn his early years in Guangzhou, Lau attended a Christmas gathering at the Sacred Heart Cathedral and first heard about Jesus. After arriving in Hong Kong, his landlord was a Christian and invited him to attend church services. When Lau joined the CIC, he was not yet a Christian. A colleague once evangelized to him, but he replied, \"Unless all of humanity is liberated, individuals cannot be liberated.\" In 1974, during a labor dispute, he experienced unfair treatment from workers, prompting him to reflect on the issues of human nature and sin. This experience, coupled with a moving encounter with a pastor in Myanmar, led to his decision to accept Jesus. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he first joined the Anglican Church and later switched to the Hong Kong Methodist Church, where he was baptized in 1975.  \n\n\nFrom 1991 to June 30, 1997, Lau served as a Legislative Council member. During the Special Administrative Region era, he was re-elected to the Legislative Council in 1998 and served until 2008.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) Peter K. K.

On the topic of Hong Kong’s 1997 handover, he published works such as Reconciliation, Reconstruction, and Hong Kong’s Future (1988). His book Theology of Reconciliation and Church Renewal (1987) systematically addressed the traumas of 1997, exploring how the gospel could heal and rebuild the city.  \n\n\nIn 1992, Yeung was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer. His reflections on faith during his illness were documented in New Life and Love (1993). In 2001, he was appointed a part-time consultant to the Central Policy Unit of the Hong Kong SAR Government.

Various denominations expressed great concern about the developments in Chinese Christianity.\n\n\nIn November 1979, at the first executive committee meeting of the 1979–1980 session of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China, General Secretary Peter Wong pointed out that churches in China had become self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. These churches were no longer denominationally divided and had severed ties with foreign missionary organizations. They would not welcome the return of foreign missionaries. Additionally, the Bibles needed by the Chinese people would no longer require printing and transport from abroad. Foreign donations for rebuilding churches and meeting other needs had to be unconditional, motivated solely by love. Wong reiterated the council's stance of \"approaching the Guangzhou Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee as a self-sustaining Chinese church, seeking their input on establishing an unconditional fund to support church reconstruction, worship restoration, hymn printing, and the provision of teaching equipment for schools formerly affiliated with churches.\"\n\n\nIn May 1980, Anglican Bishop John Baker formed the \"China Church Concern Committee,\" with members including Canon Lam Yuek-Sum (convener), Canon Yip Sai-Shan, Reverend Ng Shing-Mou, Reverend Tang Hin-Sum, Dr. Sum Shuen-Yan, Mr. Chung Si-Leung, and Bishop Baker. During its first meeting, the committee unanimously agreed to encourage believers to interact more with Chinese Christians while respecting the principles of self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance. The committee identified theological and devotional books as the most pressing needs. In April 1980, Baker and Lam visited Guangzhou to meet local church leaders and conducted discussions at Dongshan Church. Writing in Hong Kong Church News, Lam introduced the Chinese Communist Party's religious policies and concluded, \"The survival and development of Christianity in China do not depend on whether the Communist Party aims to eliminate religion but on whether our faith represents true religion and whether there are people willing to dedicate themselves to spreading this true religion.\"\n\n\nThe January 1980 issue of The Message, published by the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC), reported on how Adventists, Lutherans, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church responded to the latest developments in Chinese churches. The Christian Weekly also covered discussions by Assemblies of God, World Mission, and World Lutheran organizations concerning ministry in China.\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Bible Society produced pocket-sized simplified Chinese New Testaments to encourage believers to take them into China when visiting family, thereby spreading the Gospel.\n\n\nFollowing this visit to Hong Kong, the China Christian Council invited the HKCC for a return visit scheduled for September 12–21, 1981, to Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, and Guangzhou. The delegation, led by Pastor Peter Wong and Bishop Peter Kwong, included representatives from various churches and organizations in Hong Kong.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Mission Consultation: The Role of Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s\n\n\nIn November 1980, the HKCC held a large conference to define the mission of Hong Kong churches for the 1980s. The consultation, titled The Mission of Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s, featured eight keynote speeches, including:  \n\n- \"Viewing Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s from an Eternal Perspective\" (Bishop John Baker)  \n\n- \"Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s\" (Peter Wong)  \n\n- \"Mission Strategies and Implementation Guidelines\" (Lee King-Hung and Fung Wai-Man)  \n\n- \"The Role of Evangelical Organizations and Volunteer Groups\" (Choi Yun-Wan and Ko Siu-Wah)  \n\n- \"The Mission of Congregations in the 1980s\" (Chan Cho-Choi and Lee Bing-Kwong).  \n\n\nIn addition to keynote speeches, there were three Bible study sessions led by Chung Chi Theological Division professors, focusing on Torah traditions, servant leadership, and Jesus’ mission in the Hong Kong context.\n\n\nThe conference attracted about 120 church representatives, including those from Catholic and evangelical circles. Five missional priorities were discussed and agreed upon:  \n\n1. Evangelizing low-income citizens.  \n\n2. Evangelizing students.  \n\n3. Supporting the Chinese church.  \n\n4. Participating in public policy-making.  \n\n5. Influencing the civic mindset.  \n\n\nThe Final Report of the Mission Consultation called for the HKCC to play a more active role in advocating church participation in public policy-making. Consequently, the HKCC established the \"Public Policy Committee\" in early 1981 to address and implement strategies for influencing public policies. The committee actively responded to societal issues, including significant policies like the Legislative Council's Powers and Privileges Bill, constitutional reforms, the Basic Law, and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant.\n\n\nAt the conference’s conclusion, news broke about a proposed 100% fare hike by local bus companies. A pastor urged the conference to express strong opposition, citing the lack of public consultation and the detrimental impact on low-income citizens. A motion opposing the hike passed overwhelmingly, and the HKCC General Secretary held a press conference the next day, sparking a \"massive civic movement.\" Over 300 groups later formed the \"Joint Committee Against Fare Hikes,\" which eventually expanded into the \"Joint Committee for the Monitoring of Public Utilities.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Campaign for the Construction of the Eastern District Hospital\n\n\nIn the 1970s, Chai Wan, an eastern district of Hong Kong Island, was nicknamed the \"wild district\" due to its remoteness. Its residents, mostly living in resettlement and squatter areas, faced poverty, with hillside shanties dominating the landscape. By the 1980s, the working class made up 60% of Chai Wan’s population. In 1982, four local church organizations conducted a survey revealing inadequate medical services as a major issue.\n\n\nAt the time, Chai Wan’s transportation relied solely on a congested Shau Kei Wan Road. The lack of hospitals meant residents had to travel to Wan Chai's Tang Shiu Kin Hospital or, in severe cases, Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam, exacerbating delays and fatalities during emergencies.\n\n\nSocial workers at Methodist Epworth Village Service Center discovered that as early as 1959, the government had planned a Shau Kei Wan hospital, but the project remained unrealized two decades later. Three pastors spearheaded a campaign for a new hospital: Rev. Chu Yiu-Ming of Chai Wan Baptist Church, Rev. Lo Lung-Kwong of Epworth Village Methodist Church, and Father Kwan Lui-Tong of the Catholic Star of the Sea Church. Chan Kin-Man, then a sociology student at Chung Chi College, joined the effort, researching emergency death rates in Eastern District and producing a report that became a cornerstone of the campaign.\n\n\nOn August 29, 1982, a public assembly established the \"United Committee for the Eastern District Hospital Campaign,\" joined by over 30 organizations and professional groups like the Hong Kong Medical Association. The government eventually conceded, opening an A&E department at Chai Wan Health Center in 1984 and allocating funds for the hospital.\n\n\nThe Eastern District Hospital broke ground in April 1984, with Rev. Chu representing the committee at the ceremony. Completed in 1993, the hospital’s name was changed from \"Shau Kei Wan Hospital\" to \"Eastern District Hospital\" in honor of the campaign. In 1992, it was renamed \"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital\" to commemorate Governor Sir Edward Youde’s contributions.\n\n(1)對文革後中國教會的關注 1980（教聲1980：1，林汝升1980：3；會訊1979：5；信息1980；基督教週報1980a, 1980b, 1980c，1980d）\n\n\n1979年，文革後中國教會復堂的消息傳到香港。各宗派對中國基督教的動向表達高度關注。\n\n\n1979年11月，中華基督教會香港區會在1979至80年度執行委員會第一次會議上，總幹事汪彼得指出，中國教會已成為中國人的自治自養自傳的教會，不再分宗派，並已割斷與外國差會的關係，今後也不會歡迎外國傳教士再回去工作。中國人民所需要的聖經，也無需由國外印備運入去。面對重建聖堂及其他需要，國外捐款必須沒有條件，出於愛心的捐獻。他重申，中華基督教會香港區會「以一個實行了三自的中國人教會，設法接觸廣州市三自愛國運動委員會，向他們徵詢意見，是否可由本會設立一筆中國教會復原專款，無條件的捐給該會作為修建教堂，恢復禮拜，印刷聖詩及幫助原屬教會的中學購置儀器沒書教學用具等」。\n\n\n1980年5月，聖公會港澳教區白約翰會督特別成為「中國教會關懷委員會」，成員包括林汝升法政牧師（召集人）、葉西山法政牧師、吳繩武牧師、湯顯森牧師、沈宣仁博士、鍾士良先生及白會督。委員會在第一次會議中，一致認為應鼓勵信眾多與中國信徒接觸，亦在尊重中國教會自養、自傳和自治的原則下，給予其所需之幫助。委員會認為，當前最大需要為神學及靈修書籍。白約翰與林汝升於1980年4月17至20日，更專程北上廣州拜訪當地教會領袖，亦在東山堂進行座談。林於《港澳教聲》撰文，介紹中共的宗教政策，最後指：「基督教在中國能否存在及發展，並不在於中共有無消滅宗教的政策，而在於我們的信仰是否真宗教，而在於有沒有為傳揚這真宗教而願意獻身的人」。\n\n\n1980年1月的協進會出版的《信息》，亦報導安息日會、路得會及信義會因應中國教會最新發展作出的跟進。《基督教週報》也報導神召會、世界傳道會及世界信義宗對中國事工的討論。\n\n\n香港聖經公會，特別出版袖珍本簡體字新約聖經，鼓勵信徒回鄉探親時，可以帶到中國，讓福音得以廣播。\n\n\n是次訪港後，中國基督教協會亦邀請香港基督教協進會回訪，行程定於1981年9月12至21日，訪問上海、南京、北京及廣州，由汪彼得牧師及鄺廣傑主教任領隊。其他成員包括：翁珏光（中華基督教會合一堂）、林汝升（聖公會聖馬利亞堂）、謝約翰（信義會監督）、李明道（安息日會）、劉少康（香港浸信教會）、羅文燦（路德會副會長）、高苕華（女青年會總幹事）、黃永熙（聖經公會總幹事）、蔡元雲（突破總幹事）、錢北斗（學生福音團契總幹事）、潘應求（崇基神學組主任）、黃道一（基督教文藝出版社社長）、林卓姿（基督徒學生運動代表）、郭乃弘（協進會總幹事）、馮煒文（協進會執行幹事、侯任詢世教會協會宣教幹事）、林澤（協進會執行幹事）。\n\n\n(2)「八十年代香港教會使命」諮詢會議1980  Mission Consultation, 1980（湯泳詩2019：100-108）\n\n\n1980年11月，協進會舉辦大型會議，為進入八十年代的香港教會尋索使命。是次題為「八十年代香港教會使命」的諮詢會議，八個專題演講包括：「從永恆角度看八十年代的香港教會」（白約翰會督）、「八十年代的香港教會」（汪彼得）、「宣教路線及執行方針」（李景雄、馮煒文）、「福音機構及教會志願團體的角色」（蔡元雲、高苕華）、「八十年代堂會的使命」（陳佐才、李炳光）。除專題外，又有三次研經會，由崇基神學組三位老師負責：李熾昌（妥拉傳統與香港）、戴智民（Richard Deutsch）（僕人使命與香港）、潘應求（耶穌使命與香港）。\n\n\n出席的教會代表約120人，包括天主教及福音派亦有派代表出席。會議就五項宣教議程作討論，並達成共識：「向低薪市民傳福音」「向學生傳福音」「關懷中國教會」「參與公共政策釐定」「影響市民心態」。\n\n\n〈八十年代香港教會使命諮詢會議總報告〉指出，協進會在推動教會參與釐訂公共政策方面，應扮演較活躍的角色。職是之故，協進會於1981年初即成立了「公共政策委員會」，跟進及落實如何「參與公共政策釐定」。公共政策委員會成立後，積極回應香港社會的問題，並就一些影響民生重大的政策提出意見。這包括：立法局之權力和特權法案、政制改革及基本法、《顧問醫療報告書》、大亞灣核電廠等等。其中在香港政制改革及基本法草擬方面，委員會更舉辦了多次活動。\n\n\n在會議結束前，傳來了巴士公司向政府提出加價百分之百的建議，會上有牧師提出要求大會表達強烈反對，理由是在這影響民生的大事上，市民未被諮詢，而且加價必然嚴重影響低薪市民的生活，會議最後以極大多數通過上述動議。隨即由協進會總幹事於翌日召開記者招待會，肇始了一個「龐大的市民運動」。後來，有超過三百個團體聯合組成「反對兩巴加價聯合委員會」，日後又擴大成為「各界監管公共事業聯合委員會」。據當時任協進會總幹事的郭乃弘牧師表示，這次聯合行動的最大意義，不僅是成功逼使兩巴減低加價的幅度，更在於其開啟了以「聯席」（coalition）的方式進行社會運動的洗河。八十年代初至中期，基督教團體發起名參與的聯席委員會包括：「各界爭取監管兩電聯委會」（1981）、「各界爭取監管公共事業聯委會」（1982）、「關注民生聯委會」、「爭取興建東區醫院聯合委員會」（1982）、「各界關注同性戀法例聯委會」（1983）、「監察色情刊物監察團體聯席會議」（1985）、「爭取停建大亞灣核電廠聯席會議」（1986）等等\n\n\n(3) 爭取興建東區醫院運動（朱耀明2023：139-152）\n\n\n70年代，位於香港島東區的柴灣被區內人稱為「紅番區」，由於地區偏僻，市民大多聚居於徙置區和臨屋區，生活貧窮，山邊遍滿自建的木屋。80年代，工人階級佔柴灣人口六成。1982年，柴灣區內四所教會機構（柴灣浸信會、柴灣萬善堂、循道愛華村服務中心、天主教柴灣勞工牧民中心）合作進行「柴灣工友生活實況」調查，發現區內醫療服務不足的問題，值得關注。\n\n\n當時柴灣對外交通極不方便，只靠一條筲箕灣道，才可到達港島其他地區，但居民每日卻面對的塞車問題的困擾。當時港島東並沒有醫院，居民需往急症室就醫，最近的急症室都要到灣仔的鄧肇堅醫院。若病情或傷勢較重者，則要再等待救護車送往港島西區薄扶林的瑪麗醫院，路途遙遠，再加上塞車問題，因而常有在途中失救死亡的情況。\n\n\n當時循道愛華村服務中心社工發現，早於1959年政府已計劃興建筲箕灣醫院，但隨著區內人口增加，結果20年過後，計劃仍未見落實。有見及此，柴灣區內三位牧者乃發動居民爭取興建東區醫院運動，包括柴灣浸信會朱耀明牧師、循道衛理愛華村堂的盧龍光牧師及天主教海星堂關𠎀棠神父。當時在中文大學崇基學院社會系三年級基督徒學生陳健民，和兩位同合作以東區醫療問題報告為題目，作為通識專題研究的研究。他們不惜親身到港島東區多個救護站，懇求救護員容許他抄寫病人或傷者送院期間不治的數字，作為東區失救延醫的理據。陳健民大學畢業後，即加入循道愛華村堂社會服務中心，繼續參與爭取興建東區醫院運動，並負責資料搜集、調查和撰寫《港島東區醫療問題報告書》。\n\n\n1982年8月29日，召開聯合居民大會，成立「爭取興建東區醫院聯合委員會」，朱、關及盧三位牧者出席。對此，政府的回應並不積極。聯委會在港島東設多處街站，一周內收集到3.5萬名居民的簽名，會見東區政務專員。運動展開，東區有三十多個團體參加，此外並獲得香港醫學會、東華三院醫生協會、醫療關注組等專業組織之支持。後來，政府應度軟化，在1984年4月同意灰柴灣健康院開設急症室，並公布撥款興建東區醫院。\n\n\n1984年4月，東區醫院舉行動土禮，朱耀明牧師以聯委會成員身分獲邀出席。1993年，東區醫院竣工。東區醫院原稱為「筲箕灣醫院」，後因爭取興建運動而改名為「東區醫院」。後來，為記念1986年離世的港督尤德爵士為香港前途奔勞，於1992年將東區醫院命名為「尤德夫人」醫院。\n\n\n (4) Visit of the Chinese Christian Delegation to Hong Kong (1981)  \n\n\nIn March 1981, at the invitation of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA) and the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC), a Chinese Christian delegation visited Hong Kong for three weeks. This marked the first contact between Hong Kong and Chinese churches since the near 30-year hiatus that followed the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.  \n\n\nThe delegation consisted of eight members:  \n\n- Bishop Ding Guangxun: Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, President of the China Christian Council, and President of Nanjing Union Theological Seminary.  \n\n- Shen Derong: General Secretary of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee.  \n\n- Luo Guanzong: Vice Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, Chairman of the Shanghai Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and General Secretary of the Shanghai YMCA.  \n\n- Tang Matthew: Vice President of the China Christian Council, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and Pastor of Guangzhou Dongshan Church.  \n\n- Cao Shengjie: Deputy General Secretary of the China Christian Council.  \n\n- Han Wenzao: Deputy General Secretary of both the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and the China Christian Council.  \n\n- Cai Wenhao: Vice President of the China Christian Council, Chairman of the Zhejiang Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and Pastor of Hangzhou Bell Tower Church.  \n\n- Xiong Zhenpei: Vice Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and Chairman of the Guangdong Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee.  \n\n\nThe inclusion of two representatives from Guangdong Province highlighted the close ties between the churches in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The delegation members represented various denominational backgrounds, including Anglican, Baptist, the Church of Christ in China, and Methodist traditions, reflecting historical links to Hong Kong’s prominent denominations.  \n\n\nOn April 8, the delegation issued a Letter to Christian Brothers and Sisters in Hong Kong, emphasizing that churches in China had achieved self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation under the new China. They had eliminated internal denominational biases and mutually respected differences in faith. They stated that the Gospel had flourished during the Cultural Revolution and reiterated that under the principles of the Three-Self Movement, Chinese churches sought open exchange with overseas churches on an equal and friendly basis. They called on foreign believers to respect the autonomy and principles of the Chinese church and to avoid actions that might compromise its witness.  \n\n\nDuring their visit, the delegation attended the Asian Christian Witness Consultation and delivered three lectures:  \n\n- \"Chinese Christianity: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow\" (Cai Wenhao).  \n\n- \"The Testimony of the Chinese Church for the Gospel\" (Cao Shengjie).  \n\n- \"The Experience of Chinese Christians Participating in National Political Life\" (Han Wenzao).  \n\n\nThe delegation also held a discussion with HKCC leaders and participated in a joint thanksgiving service where Pastor Tang Matthew preached on \"The Context and Impact of the Jerusalem Council.\" The service was attended by leaders from various denominations and institutions in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nIn July 1981, the HKCC published a compilation of the delegation's visit titled The Lord’s Love Endures to the End.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Seminar on Christian Education in Hong Kong (1984)  \n\n\nIn April 1984, in response to changes triggered by Hong Kong’s future sovereignty issues and the report of the International Education Advisory Board, the HKCC co-hosted a seminar with Tao Fong Shan Christian Centre to reflect on the direction of Christian education. The seminar, titled \"Seeking: The Theological Foundation of Education in Hong Kong,\" featured Reverend Lee Ching-Tsz, who criticized churches for becoming mere contractors for the government’s educational policies. The HKCC’s theological reflections also acknowledged that churches had overly complied with governmental directives.  \n\n\nThe seminar's content was later compiled and published by the HKCC under the title Theological Reflections on Education in Hong Kong.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) The Credo and Declaration on Religious Freedom (1984)  \n\n\nStarting in the 1980s, concerns over the \"1997\" sovereignty issue became a central focus for Hong Kong residents. In March 1984, over twenty church leaders and professionals convened to discuss how Christians should face the challenges of 1997, forming the Concern Group on Hong Kong’s Future. After extensive discussions, the group drafted a position paper titled Proposals on the Beliefs Held by Hong Kong Christians Amidst Current Social and Political Changes on April 30, 1984. This document marked a significant reflection and response by Hong Kong Christians to the sovereignty issue.  \n\n\nOn May 20, a revival meeting themed \"Social Change and Believer Renewal\" was held at Kowloon City Baptist Church, where the Credo and its annotations were distributed. The event drew nearly 3,000 participants, reflecting the church’s deep concern for Hong Kong’s future.  \n\n\nTo promote the Credo, a supplementary booklet titled Examining the Credo in Context was published, with a foreword by Reverend Stephen Tong, who acknowledged the profound reflections on the intersection of faith and context prompted by the impending changes in 1997. Tong praised the Credo as the collective wisdom of 27 church workers and evangelists, representing the views of most church leaders and believers in Hong Kong. The booklet provided a theological and contextual analysis grounded in Scripture, further strengthening its biblical foundation.  \n\n\nIn May 1984, the HKCC commissioned a working group, including Chan Cho-Choi, Yu Tat-Sum, and Hui Dao-Leung, to draft a Declaration on Religious Freedom. Yu noted that the declaration aimed to foster inter-denominational collaboration and mitigate \"distrust and suspicion.\" To this end, a pastoral seminar was held on June 4 to explain the declaration, with responses from pastors such as Stephen Tong, Siu Kwok-Wai, and Chiu Tin-Yan.  \n\n\nThe declaration, eventually endorsed by 240 church organizations, was officially released on September 1, 1984, and submitted to Premier Zhao Ziyang via Xinhua News Agency. It reaffirmed the importance of religious freedom, outlined the state of religious liberties at the time, and expressed hopes for their continuation after 1997.\n\n(4) 中國基督教代表團訪問香港 1981（馮煒文、林澤 1981）\n\n\n1981年3月，應亞洲基督教議會（Christian Conference of Asia）及香港基督教協進會邀請，中國基督教代表團來香港進行為期三星期的訪問。這是1949年中共建國後，中港教會中斷近三十年交往後，重新恢復首次接觸。\n\n\n中國基督教代表團有8名成員：丁光訓主教（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席、中國基督教協會會長、南京協和神學院院長）、沈德溶（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會秘書長）、羅冠宗（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會副主席、上海市基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席、上海基督教青年會總幹事）、唐馬太（中國基督教協會副會長、廣東基督教三自愛國運動委員會副主席、廣州東山堂牧師）、曹聖潔（中國基督教協會副總幹事）、韓文藻（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會副秘書長、中國基督教協會副總幹事）、蔡文浩（中國基督教協會副會長、浙江省基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席、杭州鼓樓堂牧師）、熊真沛（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會副主席、廣東省基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席）。8名代表中，除了全國基督教愛國團體的主要負責人外，特別安排2位來自廣東省的代表，應是考慮到粵港兩地教會的緊密關係。另方面，代表團成員，也具聖公會、浸信會、中華基督教會、循道公會等「原宗派」背景，均是香港歷史悠久的宗派。\n\n\n代表團在4月8日向香港教會發布〈致香港基督教弟兄姊妹書〉，強調中國教會在新中國已實現自治、自養及自傳，並消除教會內部的宗派成見，在信仰上互相尊重。文革期間，福音沒有熄滅，反而更加興旺。在三自原則下，中國教會不是閉關自守，願意在平等友好基礎上與海外各國教會交流。期望海外信徒尊重中國教會主權和「三自」原則，不做任何有損中國教會見證的事。\n\n\n訪港期間，代表團出席「亞洲基督徒見證諮詢會」，並發表三個演講「中國基督教：昨日、今日、明日」（蔡文浩）、「中國基督教為福音所作的見證」（曹聖潔）、「中國基督徒參加國家政治生活的體驗與領受」（韓文藻）。\n\n\n會議後，代表團與協進會負責人舉行座談會、聯合感恩崇拜，由唐馬太宣講「耶路撤冷會議的前後」，崇拜出席者包括香港各宗派及機構負責人。\n\n\n1981年7月，協進會將訪問團訪港內容結集出版，書名為《主愛我們到底》。\n\n\n(5) 香港教會辦學路向研討會1984（馮穎賢1984）\n\n\n香港基督教協進會因應香港前途問題及國際教育顧問團報告書所引發的轉變，於1984年4月與道風山基督教叢林合辦研討會，反省基督教辦學的路向。研討會的主題為「覓：香港教育的神學基礎」，會上，李清詞牧師不滿教會辦學已變成政府的教育承辦商，完全受政府的教育方針所牽制。協進會就香港教育所作的神學反省中，也承認教會成了政府的承辦商，對政府的教育政策唯命是從。研討會的內容，後來由協進會結集出版，題為《香港教育的神學反省》。\n\n\n(6)信念書及宗教自由聲明1984（郭偉聯2014：84-124；邢福增2018：178-185）\n\n\n1980年代開始，「九七」香港前途問題成為港人關注的焦點。早於1984年3月，廿多位關注香港前途問題的教會領袖及專業人士聚首一堂，探討基督徒應如何面對九七挑戰，成立了「關注香港前途小組」。經過多次討論後，小組於1984年4月30日，草擬了一份名為《香港基督徒在現今社會及政治變遷中所持的信念獻議》的立場書，標誌著香港基督徒對九七問題的回應與反省。5月20日，以「社會變遷與信徒更新」為主題的培靈會於九龍城浸信會舉行，並派發《信念書註釋》，當日出席聚會者近三千人，在在反映出教會對香港社會前途的關注。\n\n\n為了推廣〈信念書〉又出版《時代信念查考》。滕近輝牧師撰寫序文，承認「當香港基督徒面臨一九九七變動之際，引起處境與信仰相互關係的深切反省。」因此，他特別稱許〈信念書〉是「廿七位教牧人員及福音機構同工的思想結晶」，「也普遍的代表著香港一般教會領袖與信徒的觀點」。而《時代信念查考》一書，「根據聖經，作了適切的神學與處境上的分析和闡述，強化了它的聖經根據」。\n\n\n1984年5月，基督教協進會委任包括陳佐才、余達心、許道良等五人的工作小組，負責草擬宗教自由聲明。余氏指出，為了推動教會間不同宗派間的合作，避免「猜疑與信任」，特別在6月4日召開一次教牧研討會解釋這份聲明。會上，滕牧師、蕭克諧、趙天恩對聲明作出回應。聲明最後獲得240個教會機構及堂會聯署。9月1日，聲明正式公佈並經香港新華社轉交國務院總理趙紫陽。聲明重申宗教自由的重要性，以及當時教會享用有的宗教自由情況，最後表達對九七年後繼續享有宗教自由的期許。\n\n (7) Visit of the Hong Kong Christian Delegation to Beijing (1984)  \n\n\nDuring the Sino-British negotiations, various sectors in Hong Kong, including professionals, business leaders, social activists, educators, university students, and notable public figures, organized delegations to Beijing to express concerns about Hong Kong's future. However, the Christian delegation's visit to Beijing occurred at the proactive invitation of the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau.\n\n\nIn May 1984, the HKCC appointed a five-member working group, including Chan Cho-Choi, Yu Tat-Sum, and Hui Dao-Leung, to draft a Declaration on Religious Freedom. The declaration was officially released on September 1, 1984, and submitted to Premier Zhao Ziyang via Xinhua News Agency. Although the declaration was only formally published on September 1, the central government and Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong had already been made aware of the church’s concerns about post-1997 religious freedom. Consequently, the central government extended an invitation to Hong Kong’s Christian community to visit Beijing.\n\n\nSince the delegation was invited by the central government, the list of members was nominated by Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong and approved by the central government. The delegation was co-led by four prominent figures:  \n\n- Bishop Peter Kwong (Anglican Bishop of Hong Kong and Macau, the first Chinese bishop).  \n\n- Rev. Stephen Tong (President of the China Graduate School of Theology and Chair of the Christian and Missionary Alliance).  \n\n- Rev. Leung Lam-Hoi (President of the Methodist Church, Hong Kong, and former Chair of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union).  \n\n- Rev. Kwok Nai-Hung (General Secretary of the HKCC).  \n\n\nThis arrangement carried significant symbolism. Bishop Kwong represented the Anglican Church, historically prominent during the colonial era. The HKCC, although younger and lacking evangelical representation compared to the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union, had been more active in social affairs and engagement with the Chinese government. Including Rev. Stephen Tong, a key evangelical leader, balanced the delegation’s composition, which also included representatives from ecumenical and evangelical backgrounds.  \n\n\nThe delegation departed for Beijing on the morning of September 5, 1984. Notably, Rev. Stephen Tong did not appear at Kai Tak Airport on the day of departure. The HKCC later explained in its publication The Message that Tong could not join the trip due to \"health reasons,\" though subsequent accounts suggested he faced significant pressure and criticism, particularly from evangelical circles in North America.  \n\n\nDuring the visit, the delegation met with officials, including Ren Wuzhi, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau, and Ji Pengfei, Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. They presented a document titled Opinions of the Hong Kong Christian Delegation on Hong Kong’s Future, accompanied by the Declaration on Religious Freedom.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (8) Visit of the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau Director to Hong Kong (1986)  \n\n\nFrom April 1 to April 10, 1986, Ren Wuzhi, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau under China’s State Council, visited Hong Kong. This marked the first official visit by a director from the Religious Affairs Bureau. The visit centered on discussions with Hong Kong’s religious community about post-1997 relations and related policy issues.\n\n\nOn April 1, the leaders of Hong Kong’s six major religions hosted a welcoming banquet. A Buddhist representative, Venerable Sik Kok-Kwong, highlighted the contributions of the religious community to Hong Kong’s social welfare, stability, and prosperity. He emphasized the need for the Basic Law to explicitly guarantee religious freedom and to preserve Hong Kong’s existing religious systems and development. Ren Wuzhi acknowledged the growing mutual understanding and respect between the religious communities in China and Hong Kong, describing such exchanges as beneficial.\n\n\nDuring his visit, Ren engaged with various Christian organizations, including the HKCC, United Christian Hospital, the Breakthrough organization, and Methodist schools. At a meeting with Christian leaders at Kowloon Methodist Church, Ren stated that after 1997, churches in Hong Kong could continue their missionary work, develop freely, and maintain links with foreign religious groups. When asked whether foreign pastors could continue serving in Hong Kong post-1997, Ren replied that such decisions would be left to the churches. He also addressed questions about preaching to young people, confirming that the Chinese constitution did not prohibit it and that Hong Kong churches could continue their current practices.  \n\n\nOn April 3, Ren visited the Islamic Union of Hong Kong, where representatives expressed confidence in religious freedom after 1997. On April 4, he toured Catholic charitable facilities, where Cardinal John Baptist Wu introduced the Catholic Church’s contributions to evangelism, education, and social services in Hong Kong. Ren reiterated that China’s policy of religious freedom would remain unchanged.  \n\n\nRen also visited Buddhist, Confucian, and Taoist institutions, including the Buddhist Hospital, the Confucian Academy, and the Wong Tai Sin Temple, commending their contributions to Hong Kong society. On April 9, Ren met again with leaders of the six major religions, reaffirming that Hong Kong would retain religious freedom under the principles of \"non-interference, non-subordination, and mutual respect,\" as outlined in Annex I of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He praised the religious community’s efforts in education, healthcare, and social welfare, emphasizing their role in Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity.  \n\n\nRen concluded that under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, Hong Kong’s religious landscape would remain unchanged post-1997, and religious organizations would not fall under the jurisdiction of China’s Religious Affairs Bureau or any other association.  \n\n(7)香港基督教訪京團1984（邢福增2018：178-185）\n\n\n中英談判期間，香港各界人士紛紛組團北上，向中國領導人表達對香港前途的關注。這包括專業人士、工商界、社會活動家、教育界、專上學生、知名人士等等。不過，基督教人士訪京之行，卻是在國務院宗教事務局主動邀請下成行的。\n\n\n先是1984年5月，基督教協進會委任包括陳佐才、余達心、許道良等五人的工作小組，負責草擬宗教自由聲明。9月1日，聲明正式公佈並經香港新華社轉交國務院總理趙紫陽。雖然聲明在9月1日才公佈，但教會界對九七後宗教自由的關注，定為香港新華社及中央知悉。因此，中央主動邀請基督教界訪京。\n\n\n由於訪京團由中央邀請，故團員名單也是經香港新華社提名，再由中央確認，其中共同領隊的四人是：鄺廣傑主教（聖公會港澳教區主教）、滕近輝牧師（中國神學研究院院長、宣道會區聯會主席）、梁林開牧師（循道衛理聯合教會會長）及郭乃弘牧師（香港基督教協進會總幹事）。上述安排無疑具有深意：其一，傳統以來，聖公會在殖民地時代均有較獨特的地位，而鄺廣傑是首位華人主教。其二，香港較具代表性的基督教團體，是香港基督教協進會及香港華人基督教聯會，雖然前者的歷史較後者為短，也沒有包括福音派的成員，但協進會向來較積極參與社會事務，比聯會更積極與中國政府接觸。其三，正因為協進會不能代表福音派，故滕近輝這位具份量的福音派領袖便榜上有名。其四，梁林開是循道衛理聯合教會會長，但他曾任多屆聯會主席（1978-1980，1982-1983）。\n\n\n至於其他團員，名單及分類如下：\n\n\n| 宗派領袖denominational leaders | 謝約翰牧師（香港基督教信義會監督）、李偉韜牧師（香港路德會會長）、王溢中牧師（基督教復臨安息日會港澳區會會長）、蕭開理牧師（東南亞神召會港澳議會會長）Rev. John Tse (Supervisor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hong Kong),  Rev. Wei-To Lee (President of the Hong Kong Lutheran Church),  Rev.

Responding to the escalating situation of the Beijing student movement, the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau held a prayer meeting for the future of China and the well-being of the Chinese nation at St. John’s Cathedral on May 11. The Diocese called on the Chinese government to \"absolutely refrain from using force to address the student movement,\" \"seek a peaceful resolution promptly,\" and \"immediately restore freedom of the press.\" Around 600 pastors and congregants attended. Bishop Peter Kwong emphasized that the students' \"righteous call is an act of patriotism,\" and he prayed for \"the Lord to grant Chinese leaders wisdom, patience, and restraint.\"\n\n\nFollowing Beijing's declaration of martial law, Bishop Kwong urged the government not to use force against the student movement. On May 21, he resigned from his positions as a member of the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the Consultative Committee. According to the church newsletter Echo, Bishop Kwong explained that his resignation was due to observing the suppression of news coverage beginning on May 20, leaving him unable to track developments. He hoped his resignation would signal the impact of the government's actions. Kwong also noted that his role in the drafting process was nearing completion and that he had already strived to secure religious freedom and direct elections.\n\n\nOn May 28, the Diocese organized \"Prayer and Fasting Meetings for China\" at four churches across Hong Kong, Kowloon, the New Territories, and Macau. After the June Fourth Massacre, the Diocese issued a statement expressing \"deep mourning\" and \"grief and indignation\" over the Beijing authorities' violent suppression and mass killings of students and citizens. A memorial service was held at St. John’s Cathedral on June 11, and on June 7, church bells tolled for one minute at noon in memory of the victims.\n\n\nOn October 31, 1989, the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress reviewed changes to the membership of the Basic Law Drafting Committee during its tenth meeting. The committee approved the resignations of Louis Cha (Jin Yong) and Bishop Peter Kwong while expressing hope for their continued contributions to the drafting process.\n\n\nBetween the declaration of martial law on May 19 and the June 4 massacre, various sectors of Hong Kong society voiced their concerns. Many churches, Christian organizations, and believers issued urgent appeals and statements of mourning. The Hong Kong Christian Patriotic Democratic Movement Committee was also established on May 2, playing a vital role in mobilizing Christian concern for national affairs. Rev. Chu Yiu-Ming represented the movement by joining the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, serving as its vice-chairman.\n\n\nMotivated by support for the 1989 student movement and outrage over the Chinese Communist Party's violent suppression, many Hong Kong Christians, denominations, congregations, and organizations issued rare prayers and statements of concern, including those from Evangelical backgrounds. While debates persisted within individual churches over whether Christians and churches should participate in protests or issue statements, the overall response of Hong Kong's churches during the events surrounding June Fourth marked a significant chapter in the intersection of church and political issues.\n\n(10) 香港基督教與六四\n\n\n1989年的六四慘案激發香港人的移民潮，香港教會承受重大衝擊。因應北京學運局勢，聖公會港澳教區特別在5月11日在聖約翰座堂舉行為中國前途及中華民族整體幸福祈禱會，並呼籲中國政府「絕對不可使用武力處理學運事件」，「從速尋求和平解決之途徑」及「立即恢復新聞自由」。當日出席的牧師及教友約600多人，鄺廣傑主教致詞時認為中國學生「發出正義的呼聲是愛國愛民的行動」，祈求「上主賜中國領導人有智慧、忍耐及克制」。聖公會港澳教區主教鄺廣傑因應北京頒佈戒嚴令，呼籲北京「切勿武力處理學運」，並於5月21日起呈辭基本法草委及諮委職務。鄺請辭的原因，據《教聲》報導：「鄺主教稱其因觀察整件學運事件之過程及演變，直至五月廿日開始出現新聞封鎖的情況，導致他無從知悉事態進展，因此他呈辭行動，讓有關方面知道他們的措施，所引來的反應。鄺主教又稱，他在基本法的起草工作已接近尾聲，又已盡力爭取宗教自由及直選，所以留任作用不會太大。」\n\n\n港澳教區在5月28日在港九新界及澳門四所教會舉行「主愛中華禁食祈禱會」。六四屠殺發生後，教區發出「沉痛哀悼」聲明，對「北京當局以暴力鎮壓學生運動，濫殺同胞」，表示悲憤，並於6月11日假聖約翰座堂舉行追思禮拜。教區各禮拜堂更於6月7日中午12時為哀悼死難學生及市民鳴鐘一分鐘。\n\n\n1989年10月31日，七屆全國人大常委會十次會議審議基本法起草委員會部分委員變動的報告，決定「同意查良鏞、鄺廣傑辭去起草委員會委員職務。希望他們對基本法起草工作繼續作出貢獻」。\n\n\n從1989年5月19日北京頒佈戒嚴，至6月4日的屠殺清場，香港社會各界紛紛表達關注，不少基督教會、團體及信徒，紛紛刊登緊急哀悼及聲明。此外，香港基督徒支援愛國民主運動委員會也於5月2日成立，在推動基督徒關心國是方面，扮演重要角色。朱耀明牧師代表基督徒愛國民主運動參加「香港市民支援愛國民主運動聯合會」（支聯會），被選為副主席。\n\n\n出於對八九學運的支持，以及對中共暴力鎮壓的義憤，不少香港基督徒、宗派、堂會及機構均罕有地發表禱文及關注聲明，其中更包括不少福音派背景的宗派堂會。毋庸置疑，個別教會內仍有關於基督徒及教會應否參與遊行及發聲明的討論，但香港教會在六四前後的整體表現，也在教會與政治議題上寫下重要的篇章。 \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n1. The \"Sinned Against\" Theology (Fung 1980; Fung Wai-man 2014: 70–79)  \n\n\nThe theological concept of the \"Sinned Against,\" proposed by Fung Wai-man (1940–), the Director of the Christian Industrial Committee (1969–1979), emerged from his reflections on faith during his involvement in labor movements. After leaving the Committee in 1979, Fung served as the Mission Secretary of the Hong Kong Christian Council. In 1981, he was invited by the World Council of Churches (WCC) to become the Secretary for Evangelism for the Commission on World Mission and Evangelism (CWME) in Geneva, Switzerland. In July 1980, he published an article titled \"Compassion for the Sinned Against\" in the journal Theology Today at Princeton Theological Seminary, first introducing this concept during a WCC seminar in 1979.\n\n\nFung noted that Christianity often emphasizes humans as sinners rebelling against God, requiring repentance. The idea of the \"Sinned Against,\" however, highlights that humans are not only sinners but also victims of sin. The \"sin\" he referred to includes the evil forces wielded by those in power and other systemic injustices permeating human life and institutions. Fung argued, \"A gospel message that lacks the notion of people being sinned against will have no relevance to those who have suffered violations.\"  \n\n\nHe further explained that viewing people only as sinners might elicit care and sympathy but lacks the element of true compassion—\"a shared concern and solidarity.\" Evangelism, he argued, cannot bypass confronting the forces of oppression or offer ready-made solutions to eliminate them. Instead, the gospel must demystify these forces, enabling the \"sinned against\" to understand, confront, and grasp their own culpability amidst these forces.\n\n\nAfter returning to Hong Kong in 1991, Fung served as the Senior Executive Secretary of the Christian Institute.\n\n\n---\n\n\n 2. The Evangelical Debate on Social Concerns (1984)  \n\n\nOn March 16, 1984, the Social Concerns Group of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Christian Fellowship invited Rev. Teng Kin-fai, Senior Pastor of North Point Alliance Church, and Rev. Chang Mok-ai, President of Alliance Bible Seminary, to the seminar Rethinking Social Concerns. This event followed articles by both pastors in November 1983, which sparked debates among Christian university students regarding the relationship between evangelism and social engagement. Olive, a publication of the Hong Kong University Fellowship, described their perspectives as representing evangelical thought: prioritizing evangelism over social concerns. Similarly, Cry Out, a magazine run by young Christian intellectuals and students, published an article in January 1984 expressing dissatisfaction with their stance. This led to the seminar, where the pastors engaged with students on the issue.\n\n\nAt the seminar, Rev. Teng expanded on his position that \"evangelism is primary, and social concerns are secondary.\" He introduced the concepts of the Life Mission (concerning salvation within God's kingdom) as the \"core mission\" (Mission Proper) and the Radiation Mission (extending God's glory through believers to society). While inseparable, these missions have an \"intrinsic order,\" with salvation taking precedence. He also introduced the concept of the \"Shadow Kingdom,\" which reflects God's justice and love but is distinct from the eternal \"Kingdom of God.\" The church's mission, he argued, should prioritize establishing the eternal kingdom before addressing the temporary \"Shadow Kingdom.\" \n\n\nRev. Chang outlined various evangelical stances on social engagement:\n\n1. Holistic Evangelism: Evangelism and social concerns are inseparable.\n\n2. Classical Mission View: Evangelism is the church's sole mission; societal change is a byproduct of evangelism and personal transformation.\n\n3. Holistic Mission: While evangelism takes precedence, social concerns are important but secondary.  \n\n\nChang emphasized that the church's primary responsibility is fulfilling the Great Commission through evangelism, with social engagement focusing on service-oriented activities. Full-person care should prioritize spiritual needs.\n\n\nThe seminar prompted extensive questions from students, primarily regarding the prioritization of evangelism over social engagement. Rev. Teng reiterated that expanding the redeemed community necessitates prioritizing evangelism, warning against social concerns overshadowing evangelism, which could lead to the church's decline. Citing examples from American churches overly focused on social reform at the expense of evangelism, he warned of diminishing congregations and influence. While social achievements in the \"Shadow Kingdom\" are commendable, they must not hinder people from joining the \"Redeemed Community.\"  \n\n\nRev. Chang also clarified that social organizations like hospitals or counseling services should focus on their respective missions, while the church should prioritize evangelism and spiritual care. Christians, he suggested, could participate in social actions as individuals or through organizations, adhering to the principle of separating church and state.\n\n(1)被罪者（Sinned Against）1980（Fung 1980；馮煒文2014：70-79）\n\n\n「被罪者」的神學觀念，由基督教工業委員會主任（1969-1979）馮煒文（1940-）提出，主要源自他投身工運時的信仰反省。馮在1979年他離開工委會後，先於香港基督教協進會任宣教幹事，隨後在1981年接受普世教會協會邀請，前往瑞士日內瓦出任世界宣教佈道委員會（Commission on World Mission and Evangelism, CWME）佈道幹事（secretary for evangelism）。1979年，他在普世教會協會的研討會上提出，1980年7月，以 “Compassion for the Sinned Against”為題發表於普林斯頓神學院期刊Theology Today上。\n\n\n馮指出，基督教常強調人是叛逆上帝的罪人，需要悔改。但「被罪者」的觀念卻提醒我們，人不僅是罪人，也是「被罪惡所犯」。他指的「罪惡」，包括世上掌權者及有勢力的、各類的罪惡力量，這些力量滲入人類的生活及組織。「一個福音信息如果缺乏人是被侵犯的觀念，是不會對那曾被侵犯的人有意義的」。「如果我們看人是罪人（而非「被罪者」），我們可能會對他們關懷、愛護、同情，但卻缺少了憐憫，一份「患難與共，關懷扶持」的憐憫」。因此，傳福音「不能挪開那些侵犯我們的罪惡勢力，也不能提供任何預備好的方案來把它消滅。福音是要除去那罪惡勢力的神話色彩，使『被罪者』能了解它，掌握它，並在這勢力當中了解自己的罪惡」。\n\n\n馮煒文在1991年回港後，出任基督徒學會高級執行幹事。\n\n\n(2) 福音派與社關的爭論 1984（港大團契1984：22-31；邢福增2018：141-142，170-175）\n\n\n1984年3月16日，中大團契社關小組邀請宣道會北角堂主任滕近輝牧師及建道神學院張慕皚院長出席「社會關懷再思」研討會。研討會的背景，是兩人在1983年11月，分別撰文闡述關於基督徒與社關的問題，其立論引起大專基督徒的關注。香港大學團契出版的《橄欖》編者，形容「兩位福音派教會的代表人物不約而同地認為應以傳福音為主為先，社關為副為後，彷彿就成了福音派對社關的立場宣言」。另一份由青年基督徒知識分子及學生創辦的刊物《吶喊》，也在1984年1月號發表了三位讀者（以斯拉、約拿、亞倫）合撰的文章，對滕、張二人將傳福音置於社關之上的觀點表達不滿。於是，中大團契便特別主辦研討會，邀請兩人與學生對話。\n\n\n滕近輝在中大團契研討會上，進一步闡釋關於「傳福音為主，社會關懷為副」的立場。首先，他提出「生命性的使命」（Life Mission）與「放射性的使命」（Radiation concept of Mission）的概念，前者是關乎在神的國度中拯救人的問題，這是「使命的主體」（Mission Proper）。隨著得救人數的擴大，「這班人會自然地把神的榮耀從他們身上放射到其所處的社會中去」。他強調，這不是「二分法」，而是「Life Mission與Radiation 合成教會的總使命，彰顯神的榮耀」。兩者的關係既「不可分割」，但卻「有必然的先後次序（Intrinsic Order）」。其次，他提出「影子神國」（Shadow Kingdom）的概念。「神國」是神從世界中救贖出來的群體，而「影子神國」，則由「神形像的餘留」及「基督教文明」所構成，並形成「影子國度」（the Reflected Kingdom of God）。「影子國度」在「國度」之外，有神的公義和慈愛在其中。教會的使命首先是建立永恆的「國度」（得救群體），其次是建立暫時的「影子國度」。因此，「所以要將教會的貢獻擴大，必須先使救贖的群體增加。」傳福音是主，社關是副，並不是二元論的「機械性（mechanical）的次序」，而是「有機性（organic）的次序」。\n\n\n張慕皚在中大團契研討會上，疏理了福音派對社關的不同立場，包括（1）整全福音事工（Holistic Evangelism）：傳福音與社關不可分割；（2）傳統純福音主義（Classical View of Mission）：教會獨一使命是傳福音，而社會改變是傳福音和個人生命改變的副產品；（3）整全的差傳事工（Holistic Mission）：傳福音與社關並非同等重要，前者應被視為教會首要和優先的責任，同而社關也不等同傳福音。他指出，教會應以完成傳福音的大使命為首要任務，而把社會參與集中在社會服務性的工作上。教會重視全人關懷，使全人關懷應以照顧靈性需要為主。\n\n\n滕、張兩人分別講述後，引發了在座不少大專基督徒的提問。其中不少仍是涉及傳福音與社關的先後次序問題。滕牧師再次解釋他的立場，「我們要令社會關懷的影響繼續擴大，我們必須將得救的群體擴大，如要擴大這個群體，必須先傳福音」。相反，若以社會關懷為主，「喧賓奪主」，教會便有「收縮」的危機。他舉美國一些積極參與社會改革，卻忽略傳福音的教會為例，「這些宗派的基督徒的人數越來越少，影響也越來越少，教會對整個世界沒有決定性的作用。質言之，「影子國度」雖有成就，但卻「攔阻了加入這個Redeemed Community」，「聖經的價值就是如果最好的東西攔阻人得救，這個東西在神永恆的Evaluation裡就是負數」。滕牧師重申，「福音派的信仰並非不注重社會關懷」，但需要有「Concrete Programme」，這樣教會才能響應。他呼籲福音派教會成立研究關於教會參與社關的部門，「研究那些是我們應做的，那些是我們不應該做的」。\n\n\n張慕皚回應主次關係時，以靈實醫院及突破為例，指其主力集中在醫治及輔導等工作，而非傳福音。因此，教會便應以傳福音及屬靈關顧為主，容許及支持其他機構做好社會關懷。至於涉及社會行動，信徒應以個人身份參與，或透過機構參與，以確立政教分離的原則。\n\n\n (3) Theological Discourses on 1997  \n\n\nThe 1997 sovereignty handover of Hong Kong sparked discussions within local churches about their role and response. The ecumenical Christian Council (HKCC) took the lead, publishing Hong Kong Churches and the Future of Hong Kong in November 1982. This work included perspectives from both ecumenical and evangelical figures, exploring 1997 from biblical, theological, local church, and young Christian viewpoints. The Public Policy Committee of HKCC affirmed that Hong Kong’s sovereignty rightly belongs to China. It also identified challenges for the church, including contextualizing theology, fostering self-reliance within churches, redefining church-community relationships, and cultivating national consciousness (HKCC 1982).  \n\n\nOn November 23, 1982, a seminar titled Hong Kong Churches and the Future of Hong Kong was held at Tao Fong Shan, featuring Rev. Lam Yu-Sing (Anglican Church), Rev. Lee Ching-Tsz (Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China), and Rev. Lo Lung-Kwong (Methodist Church). Rev. Lam stressed the need to focus on the 98% of society’s lower classes rather than those planning to emigrate. He called on churches to provide stability through pastoral care, biblical teaching, and theological reflection. Rev. Lee proposed the \"Three Nos\" approach: avoiding untruthful comforting words, not believing that crises signify the end times, and not clinging to false hope. Rev. Lo urged churches to take the opportunity to reflect on their essence and mission (Catholic Youth Federation 1983: 107–115).  \n\n\nThe Divinity School of Chung Chi College, Chinese University of Hong Kong, also addressed 1997 through its Outspoken Series, publishing works such as 1997 and Hong Kong Theology (1983), Abundant Gospel: Reflections Triggered by 1997 (1984), Christians and Politics (1985), and Citizens and Civic Education (1987).  \n\n\nEvangelicals also actively engaged with the topic. The Hong Kong Student Evangelical Fellowship published 1997: Change and Renewal (1983) and its expanded edition (1984). In the preface, Tat-Sum Yu emphasized the need for churches to systematically explore the implications of 1997 from the perspective of their nature and mission (Yu 1983). The Christian Witness Theological Association also released a series of publications, including 1997 and the Mission of the Church (1984), The Practice of Social Concern (1984), The Three-Self Church and the Future of Hong Kong Churches (1984), A Biblical Perspective on Human Rights, Freedom, Democracy, and Rule of Law (1985), The Church’s Path (1986), The Basic Law and Religious Policies (1986), and Church-State Perspectives (1987). These books, often based on seminars, addressed theological reflections, church missions, the Three-Self Church, church-state relations, and religious policies within the context of 1997.\n\n\nWendell P. Karsen, a missionary from the Reformed Church in America, noted that even among evangelicals, discussions on 1997 reflected a newfound social consciousness. He quoted Lam Chak of HKCC, who described the Christian Witness Theological Association as representing \"the radical politicization of Hong Kong’s evangelicals,\" spurred by concerns over religious freedom post-1997 (Karsen 2020: 191). This social awakening was evident among both evangelicals and ecumenicals.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) The HKCC Directional Disputes (1986–1987)  \n\n\nThe HKCC, comprising various denominations and Christian organizations, faced internal conflicts over its political stance in the mid-1980s. Rev. Kwok Nai-Ho, who served as General Secretary from 1978, advocated for the church's active engagement in Hong Kong’s socio-political development. Kwok later reflected that his initiatives raised concerns among mainland Chinese authorities and led some church leaders to caution him against pursuing actions lacking broad consensus within Hong Kong’s churches.\n\n\nBy 1986, two opposing views emerged within HKCC:\n\n1. Some church leaders advocated for churches to align with or submit to governing authorities.\n\n2. Others, represented by Kwok, argued for maintaining a critical distance from authorities, intervening when necessary.  \n\n\nAt the HKCC’s annual meeting in September 1986, a reshuffle of the Executive Committee shifted its stance. According to Kwok, influential church leaders stopped nominating key contributors who supported his approach, such as Rev. Lee Chi-Cheung and Rev. Wu Ping-Kit from the Methodist Church and Anglican leaders like Canon Anthony Chan, Rev. Tsang Kei-Choi, and Rev. Chan Yin-Cheong. These changes resulted in a more conservative leadership, with Ms. Chiu-Wa Ko from the YWCA replacing the politically neutral Leung Lam-Hoi as Chairperson.\n\n\nThe new Executive Committee imposed stricter oversight, requiring all committee decisions to be approved by the Executive Committee before implementation. This significantly impacted the Public Policy Committee, established in 1981 to address social issues. Key initiatives were delayed or vetoed, including responding to Shum Wai-Sze's article on the Basic Law and religious freedom. Even seminar speaker lists required approval, and special committee members were restricted to those from HKCC-member congregations.\n\n\nIn September 1987, Public Policy Committee members, including Chairman Yu Tin-Yau, submitted a joint statement criticizing the Executive Committee for obstructing their initiatives, accusing HKCC of abandoning its responsibility to shape Hong Kong’s future and fulfill its prophetic role in society. This disagreement led to collective resignations from the committee and Kwok Nai-Ho stepping down as General Secretary in September 1988.\n\n\nJournalist Emily Lau reported in the Far Eastern Economic Review in December 1987 (later republished in Ming Pao), describing a growing divide between conservative and progressive factions in Hong Kong’s mainstream churches. She criticized certain church leaders for allegedly yielding to Beijing's influence. Leung Lam-Hoi acknowledged in the article that the new leadership sought to avoid transforming HKCC into an oppositional pressure group. He remarked, \"1997 hasn’t arrived yet, but some in Hong Kong are already dictating what can or cannot be done.\"\n\n(3) 九七神學論述\n\n\n隨著香港九七前途問題的出現，激發香港教會對九七的回應。在普世派方面，基督教協進會的公共政策委員會，率先於1982年11月，出版《香港教會與香港前途》一書，匯集了普世派及福音派人士，從聖經、神學、地方教會及青年基督徒的角度作探討。公共政策委員會也表明立場：認定香港作為中國的一部分，香港主權屬於中國是理所當然的。委員會又指出，九七正好對香港教會作出挑戰，特別是如何致力於神學的本色化及處境化，及教會如何自立的問題。同時，教會與社區的關係，以及建立國民意識，也是未來要反省及實踐的（基督教協進會1982）。\n\n\n1982年11月23日，道風山舉辦了「香港教會與香港前途教牧同工研討會」，由聖公會林汝升牧師、中華基督教會李清詞牧師及循道衛理會盧龍光牧師主講。林強調，教會要將關心重點放在98%中下層人士身上，而非那些將要離港的人。教會應在牧養、聖經及神學上安定人心。李則提出「三不」，即不說自己也不相信的安慰話，不應認為危急關頭，世界末日將至，以及為希望求存。盧則呼籲教會值此機會重新反省其本質與使命（天主教青年聯會1983：107-115）。\n\n\n此外，中文大學崇基神學組也出版「吐露叢書」作回應：《1997與香港神學》（1983）、《豐盛的福音：從九七所引發的反省》（1984）、《基督徒與政治》（1985）、《公民與公民教育》（1987）。\n\n\n除普世派外，福音派方面也積極探索，例如香港學生福音團契先後出版《1997：轉變與更新》（1983）及《1997：轉變與更新（增訂本）》（1984）。余達心在〈序〉中指出，教會需要有組織地去探討九七各種含意，從教會的本質與使命角度來看九七（余達心1983）。而福音證主協會更出版一系列的「正視集」：《1997與教會使命》（1984）、《社會關懷的實踐》（1984）、《三自與香港教會前景》（1984）、《從聖經看人權自由民主法制》（1985）、《教會前路》（1986）、《基本法與宗教政策》（1986）、《政教縱橫》（1987）。上述書籍，主要是由福音證主協會舉的研討會結集出版，內容不僅涉及香港教會的使命及神學反思，也包括對三自教會及政教關係、宗教政策，以及基本法的探討。\n\n\n美國歸正教會派駐香港的傳教士嘉偉德（Wendell P. Karsen），曾引述基督教協進會的林澤形容福音證主協會代表「香港福音派激進地政治化」（radical politicization of HK’s evangelicals）：「為甚麼他們突然變得這麼具社會意識(social conscious)？……答案是因為1997這令人生畏的年份快將臨到，而它會威脅到宗教的自由」（嘉偉德2020：191）。相信這不僅適用於福音派，也同樣可對應在普世派傳統。\n\n\n(4) 協進會路線之爭 1986-1987（邢福增2018：210-212）\n\n\n基督教協進會由香港不同的宗派及基督教團體組成，各會員教會及團體選派代表組成執委會。郭乃弘牧師自1978年起擔任總幹事，在其帶領下，協進會積極關注香港社會及政治的發展。郭在回憶錄中指出，其工作引起中方憂慮，並有香港教會領袖跟他表達：「他善意勸告我，我不當做香港教會沒有共識的事」。1986年開始，協進會出現兩種對立意見：（1）部分會員教會領袖認為教會「當依附甚至順服政權」；（2）以郭乃弘為代表的路線，認為教會「當與政權保持距離，並在有需要時對政權進行批判」。\n\n\n1986年9月協進會舉行周年大會，並改選執委會。由於個別宗派委派的人選有所改變，導致執委立場出現變化。據郭乃弘指出：「幾位教會領袖……停止繼續委派對協進會有貢獻但被視為支持我的教牧同工，如區會的李熾昌牧師、胡丙杰牧師和聖公會的陳佐才法政牧師、曾繼才牧師、陳衍昌牧師等分別代表區會和聖公會出席協進會並成為協進會的執委。」而執委會主席由也由基督教女青年會的高苕華出任，取代了政治中立的梁林開。協進會的改選事件，引起傳媒及學者廣泛關注，形容為保守勢力的冒起。\n\n\n新一屆的執委及領導層，主導了協進會的路線。1987年2月25日，執委就協進會路線召開座談會，出現了兩種不同意見，一是主張協進會工作不應涉及政治敏感問題，二是要適切回應不變轉變社會的需要。後來，執委會改變管理模式，由「授權」（delegation）改為「管束」（control），要求各委員會須獲執委同意才能進行各項工作。郭乃弘指出，此舉明顯是要針對公共政策委員會。\n\n\n協進會公共政策委員會早於1981年成立，在不同社會議題上積極表達意見。郭氏提及的管束管理，即1987年新一屆執委，要求各委員會工作，須獲執委會通過才能進行，結果公共政策委員會不少決定，因執委無法即時通過而擱置。此外，執委會於5月否決公共政策委員會在2月提出回應辛維思〈基本法與宗教自由〉一文的動議。甚至連委員會主辦研討會邀請講員名單，也要獲執委通過；又限制各委員會的特約委員所屬堂會須為協進會會員。\n\n\n1987年9月，公共政策委員會由主席袁天佑，連同陳立僑、陸漢思、黃永生、馮智活、郭達潮等成員，向協進會成員教會代表發出聲明，批評執委會「屢次拒絕或拖延討論本委員會提出的議案……令委員會事工無法推展」。聲明又指出，協進會處於香港的關鍵時刻，「失卻了對塑造香港未來政制的承擔，及教會作為社會先驅者的角色，不但是推卸了上帝交付的時代使命，實亦是倒退的做法」。由於協進會執委與公共政策委員會就關注社會的立場及行動在了解上無法一致，導致委員會委員的集體辭職。郭乃弘亦於1988年9月離任。\n\n\n時任新聞工作者的劉慧卿於1987年12月23日在Far Eastern Economic Review以英文發表“ ‘An Unholy Alliance’: Protestant Liberals Accuse Leaders of Bowing to Peking”一文（ 1988年1月4日於《明報》再發表〈基督教會的非神聖同盟〉），指香港主流教會出現保守派與開明派的政治分化，並點名批評個別教會領袖聽從北京的意見。梁林開接受劉氏訪問時，承認「現在的協進會執委會不希望該會變成與當局對抗的壓力團體」，教會存在「無形壓力」，「一九九七年還未到，但香港有些人已在規定甚麼可以或不可以做。」\n\n\n (5) The Controversy Over Decriminalizing Homosexuality in 1988  \n\n\nIn June 1988, the Hong Kong government released a consultation document titled Should the Laws on Homosexual Offenses Be Revised?, presenting three options for public consideration:  \n\n1. Retain the existing laws without changes.  \n\n2. Decriminalize consensual private homosexual acts between two men, applicable only to males aged 21 and above.  \n\n3. Reduce penalties for consensual private homosexual acts between adults, lowering the maximum sentence from life imprisonment to a fine of HK$5,000 and one year of imprisonment. Additionally, gross indecency offenses would see penalties reduced from two years’ imprisonment to a fine of HK$2,000 and three months’ imprisonment.  \n\n\nThe Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union, at its July board meeting, resolved to oppose any changes to the laws and established a task force to monitor developments. In September 1988, they released a position paper reiterating that homosexual behavior was \"contrary to truth, nature, psychology, and physiology, harming families and society.\" They advocated for stricter penalties and associated homosexuality with the spread of AIDS.  \n\n\nIn August, the Christian Industrial Committee hosted a seminar featuring Catholic Father Franco Mella, Anglican Rev. Philip Wickeri, Professor Albert Chen from the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Law, and clinical psychologist Tsang Ka-Tat, who all supported decriminalization on the grounds of personal freedom. However, Dr. Yuen-Wan Choi of the Breakthrough Organization strongly opposed the decriminalization, founding the Joint Committee on the Legal Reform of Homosexuality. Choi published A Perspective on Homosexuality, arguing that homosexuality was a psychological disorder requiring treatment and criticizing the Law Reform Commission for ignoring public opinion, public health, and social morality. Evangelical Pastor Stephen Su from Evangelical Free Church of China Yan Fook Church took a biblical stance, condemning homosexuality as a violation of divine law, \"shameful,\" and \"abominable\" in God's eyes.  \n\n\nIn October, groups including the Hong Kong Christian Students Movement, Hong Kong Women Christian Council, Christian Industrial Committee, and several community churches issued a joint statement. They opposed criminalizing individuals' private lives, asserting that laws should not govern morality. They expressed hope for a society that upholds human rights, freedom, and diversity, emphasizing that Christians should not impose their faith on non-believers through legislation. They also highlighted the broader social implications of decriminalization on Hong Kong’s future societal model.\n\n\nIn 1991, the law decriminalizing homosexuality was passed, with only six votes against.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) The Debate Over Christian Migration  \n\n\nThe emigration wave of the 1980s significantly impacted Hong Kong churches. A 1990 survey by Hong Kong Evangelical 2000 indicated that 2.1% of church members emigrated, compared to 1% of the general population. The migration of pastoral staff was particularly notable; statistics show that between 1982 and 1997, at least 2,000 active pastors emigrated.  \n\n\nSome pastors left under the guise of pursuing further studies, often with financial support from their churches, only to resign afterward, which disrupted their congregations. Hasty departures by pastors and church members sometimes damaged relationships within the faith community. In some cases, pastors rationalized their emigration with theological justifications, creating tensions between the notions of \"staying in God’s will\" (主留) and \"leaving in God’s will\" (主溜).  \n\n\nIn 1988, the China Graduate School of Theology hosted a seminar on this topic, later compiled into a publication titled To Stay or To Leave (1989). The migration trend sparked debates over the ethical and spiritual responsibilities of Christians and church leaders amidst the uncertainty of Hong Kong's future.  \n\n(5) 同性戀非刑事化爭議1988（聯會1988；中國與教會1988；時代論壇1988；蘇穎智1988a,1988b）\n\n\n1988年6月，政府推出諮詢文件《有關同性戀罪行的法律應否修改？》，文件中列出三個意見給市民選擇：（1）與當時行使法律一樣不變；（2兩名男子同意而私下進行的同性性行為活動，可以非刑事化，不過法律項目建議只適用於21歲以上的男性；（3）對彼此同意而私下進行同性性行為的成年人，減輕刑罰，即由最高刑罰終身監禁減為罰款五千元兼監禁一年。另外， 粗獷性行為由監禁兩年改為罰款二千元兼監禁三個月。\n\n\n香港華人基督教聯會於7月的董事會上，通過堅持同性戀法律不變，並成立專責小組跟進，1988年9月發表立場書，重申同性戀行為「有悖真理，違反自然，心理生理，殃及家人，影響社會」，應加重刑責。同時，也指同性戀有助傳播愛滋病。\n\n\n8月，教會工作者協會主辦研討會，天主教夏其龍神父、聖公會馮智活牧師及港大法律系陳文敏、臨床心理學家曾家達均以不應干涉人身自由而支持非刑事化。不過，「突破」 機構蔡元雲醫生強烈反對同性戀非刑事化，他成立「各界關注同性戀法例聯合委員會」，出版《同性戀透視》一書，認為同性戀是一種心理疾病，需要接受治療，並批評香港法律改革委員會漠視民意、公共衛生及社會道德。播道會恩福堂蘇穎智牧師，則從聖經的角度，指同性戀違反了神創造之律，且是「可恥」的行為，為神所「憎惡」。\n\n\n10月，香港基督教學生運動、香港婦女基督徒協會、教會工作者協會、朋輩神學團契、基督教工業委員會、深愛堂社關團契、官塘社區教會及西九龍社區教會聯合發表聲明，認為不應隨便定人以罪，並指法律難以處理私德，反對利用法律控制人的道德。盼望香港可以保障人權，成為自由進步和多元化的社會。基督徒不應利用法律將自己的信仰強加於非教徒身上。他們認為，同性戀能否非刑事化，不單影響同性戀者，對香港未來社會型態的發展，也有重大影響。\n\n\n1991年，有關非刑事化的法例，最終在只有6票反對下通過。\n\n\n(6) 基督徒及教牧移民之爭議（梁家麟1993：68-78；梁家麟2002：67-73；香港福音二千1991：35-38；吳羅瑜、許志賢1989）\n\n\n80年代香港的移民潮也對香港教會帶來衝擊。香港福音二千在1990年進行的調查，指信徒移民佔信徒人口比例2.1%，比香港移民佔人口比例的1%高。其中教牧同工移民的情況亦頗嚴重。有統計1982至1997年間，最少2000名在職教牧人員移民他國。個別牧者以進修為為名，甚至獲教會資助進修，然後辭職，對牧養群體帶來傷害。也有牧者或信徒，匆匆移民離港，破壞了信徒間的關係。甚至有牧者為合理化移民而提出神聖理由，「主留」與「主溜」在教會內也形成張力。1988年，中國神學研究院主辦了一次有關去留的研討會，內容結集以《去留之間》（1989）為名出版。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian leaders.\n\n此十年間，未有明顯的反基督教的領袖。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年間，未有明顯的反基督教的組織 \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n(1) The \"Xin Weisi\" Controversy on Church-State Separation (1986)  \n\n\nIn March 1986, a writer using the pseudonym \"Xin Weisi\" published a series of articles in the Ming Pao Freedom Forum, adopting a stance supportive of the Chinese government. Among these articles, Xin expressed his views on the Basic Law and religious freedom, criticizing the increasing politicization of Hong Kong churches and voicing concerns over \"church-state union\" (Xin Weisi 1986). He later expanded these ideas in articles titled Further Discussion on the Basic Law and Religious Freedom Parts I and II (Xin Weisi 1987).  \n\n\nDuring the consultation and drafting stages of the Basic Law, Xin advocated for the principle of church-state separation. He argued that religious groups \"should not participate in politics\" and that religious freedom should only encompass \"legitimate religious activities.\" Activities beyond this scope, particularly those involving \"church-state union\" or using religious platforms to undermine China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, should not be included. Citing Christianity’s historical ties to imperialism in China, Xin emphasized that the Chinese Constitution prohibits religious groups from being influenced by foreign powers. He argued that Hong Kong religious organizations should not interfere with China's religious policies, nor use the territory’s religious freedoms as a base for proselytization, recruiting believers, or forming secret religious organizations affiliated with foreign entities, as such actions would harm Hong Kong's religious institutions.  \n\n\nXin named specific Christian organizations, including the Christian Industrial Committee, the Tsuen Wan Ecumenical Social Service Center, the Hong Kong Christian Council, and the Catholic Social Communications Office. He also mentioned community organizations with indirect ties to Christianity, such as the Society for Community Organization and the Public Housing Tenants’ Association. He criticized their increasing politicization, particularly the Christian Industrial Committee's involvement in labor disputes, industrial issues, and socio-political events, positioning it as a cross-sector pressure group. Xin also highlighted the political engagement of church leaders such as Rev. Kwok Nai-Ho, General Secretary of the Hong Kong Christian Council, and Bishop Francis Hsu, Auxiliary Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, who had attended the High Hill Democratic Reform Conference to express opinions on constitutional reform.  \n\n\nXin's views, closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party’s position on religion and society, sparked significant responses from Christians. The Hong Kong Christian Watchmen Society provided a particularly strong rebuttal. Its theoretical group differentiated between various levels of church-state relationships: religion and politics, the church and politics, the government and religion, and the government and the church. They clarified that church-state separation pertains only to the institutional separation of churches and governments, not the disconnection of religion or churches from politics.  \n\n\nThe Watchmen Society argued that as faith communities practicing Christianity, churches are morally obligated to engage with political concerns. As civil organizations, churches also have the right to participate in lawful political activities. Thus, the principle of separation does not apply to the relationship between the church and politics. Xin’s conflation of these distinct concepts of church-state relations was seen as misleading.  \n\n\nAlthough Xin’s proposals were not included in any draft or final version of the Basic Law, his writings played a significant role in communicating the Chinese government's concerns about Hong Kong churches’ political engagement. Commentators have noted that Xin’s articles were a means to send a strong message, signaling Beijing's unease and dissatisfaction with the churches’ active participation in politics.  \n\n\nIt was widely speculated at the time that \"Xin Weisi\" represented a collective of writers from the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency. In 2003, with the founding of the pro-Beijing political party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) and Jasper Tsang Yok-Sing serving as its chairman, it was revealed that he was the author behind the pseudonym Xin Weisi.  \n\n(1)辛維思「政教分離」論爭1986（辛維思1986；1987；守望社理論組1987）\n\n\n1986年3月，有人以「辛維思」為筆名，於《明報》自由論壇發表大量文章，立場明顯傾向中國政府。其中，辛氏亦就基本法與宗教自由問題闡述他的觀點。他批評香港教會的政治化趨勢，表達了對「政教合一」的憂慮（辛維思1986）。後來他又發表了〈再談基本法與宗教自由〉（上）及（下），（辛維思1987）。\n\n\n當時正值基本法進行諮詢及起草階段，辛文主張基本法須確立「政教分離」原則，即宗教團體「不宜參與政治」。其所理解的宗教自由，只限於「合法的宗教活動」，「不應包括超越宗教活動以外的『政教合一』活動，當然也不應該包括借宗教活動來損害中國對香港行使主權的『自由』」。他特別提及基督教在歷史上與帝國主義侵華的關係，故中國憲法規定「宗教團體和宗教事務不受外國勢力的支配」。故此，香港的宗教組織不宜「干預中國在內地實行的宗教政策」，企圖以香港特區享有宗教自由來「攻擊中國政府的宗教政策」，或「以香港為基地，向內地人傳授教理、吸收信徒、甚至成立隸屬外國的宗教秘密組織」，這樣對香港宗教組織並「沒有好處」。\n\n\n辛文曾指名的基督宗教團體包括：基督教工業委員會、荃灣合一社會服務中心、基督教協進會、天主教社會傳播處，另與基督教關係較間接的社區組織協會及公屋評議會也包括在內。「這些以教會名義參與社會事務的團體便漸趨政治化。如基督教工業委員會，幾乎涉足於所有的工潮、工業事件、社會政治事件，成為跨越政、教、工業的壓力團體。另一方面，香港基督教協進會和天主教社會傳播處也經常組織基督徒議員的聚會，支持他們參政。」他又提及個別教職人士（特別是基督教協進會總幹事郭乃弘、天主教香港教區副主教曾慶文）出席民主政制高山大會，發表政制改革意見，反映出某些教職人士「希望教會作為一個整體直接參政」。\n\n\n查辛文的觀點，跟中共向來對宗教與社會關係的表述完全一致，其對政教分離的扭曲解釋，引起不少基督徒的回應，其中以基督徒香港守望社的反駁，最為有力。守望社理論組將「政」「教」關係區分為政治與宗教、政治與教會、政府與宗教、政府與教會四個不同層次，並指出政教分離的概念，僅指涉教會與政府在政制及權力來源上的分離，而非政治與宗教，或教會與政治的分離。就「政府」機構與「教會」組織的關係而言，政教是應該分離的。至於「教會」作為民間組織是否需要及是否有權利參與政治活動，理論組重申「教會作為實踐基督教信仰的群體，當然在責任上不能自絕於政治關懷的門外」，同時，教會作為民間組織，也具「權利」參與任何合法的政治活動。因此，分離的原則不適用於教會與政治的層面。辛文將不同概念的政教關係混淆，作出不必要的誤導。\n\n\n雖然辛維思的觀點並未見於基本法不同版本的討論稿及定稿內，但辛文的重要性及意義，其實並不是要將之納入基本法內，而是公開向香港教會傳達出中方的立場與憂慮，藉此影響香港教會往後對社會及政治議題的取態。有評論指出，辛文主要為中方「傳達一個強烈信息，表示他們對香港教會的積極參政深感憂慮和不滿」。\n\n\n當時許多人以為辛維思是中共駐港機構新華社香港分社的寫作班子，2003年底，香港左派成立政黨「民主建港聯盟」，馬力任主席，證實他就是辛維思。 ",
