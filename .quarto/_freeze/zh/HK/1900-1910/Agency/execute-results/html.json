Hoare (霍約瑟)**  \n\n(Source: Chung Yan Lap, 1951: 17–20; St. Paul’s College, n.d. a)  \n\n(1) 霍約瑟 Joseph C. Hoare（鍾仁立1951：17-20； St. Paul’s College n.d a）\n\n\n**Joseph C. Hoare (霍約瑟, 1851–1906)**  \n\n\nJoseph C. Hoare was the fourth bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Victoria (1898–1906). Born in 1851, he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was ordained into the clergy. Sent by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) to China, Hoare established Trinity Theological School in Ningbo, Zhejiang, where he served as principal. During his 20 years in Ningbo, he became proficient in the Ningbo dialect and developed a unique educational model, \"evangelical theory through ambulando\" (\"learning theology through missionary practice\"). This method emphasized hands-on training, with Hoare personally leading students on preaching journeys to remote villages. These missions often lasted up to ten weeks, blending demonstration and instruction. Under his leadership, Trinity Theological School trained dozens of Chinese missionaries, becoming a premier institution in the region.  \n\n\nOn June 11, 1898, Hoare was consecrated as the Bishop of Victoria at St. Paul's Cathedral in London and was posted to Hong Kong.  \n\n\nIn 1901, Hoare reorganized St. Paul’s College into a theological seminary focused on training Chinese clergy. He reached an agreement with the CMS, whereby the bishop directly managed the teaching while the CMS provided additional staff and resources. During his tenure, the Chinese Anglican community in Hong Kong expanded, adding Holy Trinity Church and All Saints' Church alongside St. Stephen’s Church. Hoare also established the Chinese Anglican Church Body in 1902, which was incorporated as a legal entity under his leadership as chairman.  \n\n\nIn September 1906, Hoare led four theology students from St. Paul’s College (Ho Dao-pei, Cheng Yung-chi, Leung Kam-po, and Wong Ting-sang) on a missionary trip to Castle Peak by sea. On their return journey on September 18, they encountered the “Bingwu Typhoon,” which capsized their boat. Both Hoare and the students perished, and their bodies were never recovered. Only Hoare’s prayer book was found, opened to Psalm 23:4:  \n\n*\"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\"*  \n\n\nOn September 30, 1906, memorial services for Hoare were held simultaneously at St. John’s Cathedral in Hong Kong and Holy Trinity Cathedral in Shanghai. A commemorative stone was later placed in the Anglican Bishop’s House in Hong Kong in honor of Bishop Hoare.  \n\n霍約瑟（Joseph C. Hoare, 1851-1906），聖公會維多利亞教區第四任主教(1898-1906)，生於1851年，於劍橋大學三一學院畢業後，按立為聖品。由聖公會海外傳道會派到中國，在浙江寧波籌建三一神道學校，並任校長。在寧波二十餘年間，霍約瑟學懂寧波話，並習得自身獨特的敎育模式：「evangelical theory through ambulando」（「修行佈道習神學」），主要圍繞出外鍛煉。霍約瑟曾親自帶領學徒到各偏僻村莊佈道，除了自身示範之餘又向學徒說敎，佈道團每次遠行可長達十週。三一書院在霍約瑟帶領期間，成功培育數十名華人傳敎士，於眾多地區中首屈一指。1898年6月11日，他在倫敦聖保羅座堂被祝聖為維多利亞教區主教，派駐香港。\n\n\n1901年，霍約瑟將聖保羅書院改組，重新轉型為神學院，旨在培訓華人神職人員。他與英國海外傳道會達成協議，敎學由主教親自管理，海外傳道會則提供額外人手及資源援助。在霍約瑟任內，香港聖公會華人牧區亦有所增加，除聖士提反堂外，亦有聖三一堂及諸聖堂。霍約瑟乃組織香港區議會（The Chinese Anglican Church Body），於1902年向政府立案為法人。區議會由教區主教任主席。\n\n\n1906年9月，霍約瑟帶領4位聖保羅書院神學生（賀道培、鄭容枝、梁芹波、王挺生）循海路到青山佈道，在9月18日回程時遇上「丙午風災」，主教及四位學生因翻船罹難，搜索遺體不獲，只找到主教使用的一本祈禱書，剛好翻開《詩篇》23篇第4節一頁：「我雖然行過死蔭的幽谷，也不怕遭害，因為你與我同在；你的杖，你的竿，都安慰我。」1906年9月30日，香港聖約翰座堂及上海聖三一座堂同日為霍約瑟舉行追思禮拜。在聖公會主教府內，亦置一紀念霍約瑟主教的碑石。\n\n\n**(2) Gerald H. Lander (倫義華)**  \n\n(Source: Chung Yan Lap, 1951: 21–22; St. Paul’s College, n.d. b)  \n\n(2) 倫義華 Gerald H. Lander（鍾仁立1951：21-22; St. Paul’s College n.d b）\n\n\n**Gerald H. Lander (倫義華, 1861–1934)**  \n\n\nGerald H. Lander served as the fifth Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Victoria (1907–1920). He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was ordained as a priest in 1885. In 1904, he became a pastor at Liverpool Cathedral, and in 1907, he was consecrated as bishop, succeeding Bishop Joseph C. Hoare, who had perished in the \"Bingwu Typhoon.\"  \n\n\nThe Church Missionary Society (CMS) sought to revive St. Paul’s College to provide Western-style education for Chinese students. They proposed relocating the existing seminary to China to attract more funding and students. In 1909, St. Paul’s College reopened under its original model, with the CMS taking full control of academic affairs. The bishop’s role became akin to that of a present-day school supervisor.  \n\n\nBeyond the college, Lander witnessed rapid growth in the Anglican Church in Hong Kong. In 1912, the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui (the Chinese Anglican Church) was established as an independent province separate from the Church of England. In 1915, St. Paul’s Girls’ College (now St. Paul’s Co-educational College) was founded. During the 1910s, both Diocesan Boys’ School and Diocesan Girls’ School acquired their current campuses, while St. Paul’s College itself expanded its facilities, doubling its enrollment capacity.  \n\n倫義華（Gerald H. Lander, 1861-1934）主教，聖公會維多利亞教區第五任主教（1907-1920），畢業於劍橋大學三一神學院，1885年按立為牧師。1904年任利物浦座堂牧師，1907年祝聖為主教，接替因「丙午風災」罹難的霍約瑟主教。\n\n\n英國海外傳道會計劃恢復聖保羅書院爲華人提供西式敎育，認爲將現有神學院遷往中國能有助募資收生。1909年，聖保羅書院以舊有模式重開，敎學方面由英國海外傳道會全面接管，會督的角色則與現今之校監相似。\n\n\n書院以外，倫義華見證敎會於香港急速成長：1912年中華聖公會創立，後成爲自身敎省，獨立於英格蘭敎會；聖保羅女書院（今聖保羅男女中學）於1915年創立；1910年代，拔萃女書院與男書院雙雙購獲現有校址，而聖保羅書院本身亦於同期擴建校園，收生量倍增。\n\n\n**(3) Matthew A-Jet (鄺日修)**  \n\n(Source: Xing Fuzeng, 2014a: 108–112; Chung Yan Lap, 1975: 7–11; Zhong Hua Xu Xing Wei Ban Hui, 1921: 269)  \n\n(3) 鄺日修 Matthew A-Jet（邢福增2014a：108-112；鍾仁立1975: 7-11；中華續行委辦會1921：269）\n\n\n**Matthew A-Jet (鄺日修, 1840–1921)**  \n\n\nMatthew A-Jet, a pastor, was born on September 3, 1840, in Shiliantang Village, Sanjia Market, Taishan County. In his early years, he worked at mines in Australia, where he became a Christian in Sydney in 1868 and later became a preacher. He returned to China in 1874 and joined Anglican missionaries on itinerant preaching tours in Zengcheng and Beihai. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he expressed his calling to Bishop John S. Burdon of the Anglican Church and enrolled in the theological program at St. Paul’s College. At the time, the London Missionary Society (LMS) in Hong Kong lacked Chinese preachers. Upon A-Jet’s graduation, the LMS borrowed him from the Anglican Church to serve as a missionary. LMS missionaries E. J. Eitel and John Chalmers held A-Jet in high regard.  \n\n\nAfter serving as an LMS missionary for seven years, A-Jet joined the Anglican Church in 1883. On July 8, 1883, he was ordained as a deacon, becoming the second Chinese cleric ordained by the Anglican Church in Hong Kong. On March 9, 1884, he was ordained as a pastor and succeeded Luo Xin Yuan, who had retired, in leading the ministry of St. Stephen’s Church. After moving to Kowloon in 1902, A-Jet became deeply involved in church work, actively promoting missionary and charitable efforts in Kowloon City and nearby areas. He made significant contributions to the establishment of the Holy Trinity Church parish.  \n\n\nWhile serving at Holy Trinity Church, A-Jet founded the Almshouse in 1902 to aid the poor, sick, and elderly. He later expanded it to include the Tian Guo Rescue Chapel. In 1903, he joined other Chinese pastors from the LMS and Baptist Church in petitioning the Hong Kong government to allocate land in Kowloon for a Chinese Christian cemetery. The government approved the request in 1904, creating the first Chinese Christian cemetery in Kowloon. In 1906, A-Jet established St. Paul’s Primary School (later renamed Tian Guo Primary School) in Kowloon Walled City to provide education for impoverished youth, teaching general subjects and vocational skills.  \n\n\nA-Jet also valued literary work and authored several books, including *True Doctrine Clarified*, *Discerning Right from Wrong*, and *Paths of Heaven*. He passed away on January 20, 1921, at the age of 81.  \n\n鄺日修（Matthew A-Jet, 1840 -1921）牧師，祖籍台山縣三夾墟石蓮塘村，生於1840年9月3日。鄺日修早年遠赴澳洲礦場工作，1868年間在悉梨信主，後任傳道。1874年回國，曾隨同聖公會傳教士於增城、北海等地巡迴佈道。到香港後，向當時聖公會的包爾騰主教（John S. Burdon）陳述心志，進入聖保羅書院神道班學道。當時香港倫敦會因缺乏華人傳道，適逢鄺氏畢業，乃向聖公會商借聘請他為宣教師。兩位主理倫敦會在港事務的傳教士歐德理（E. J. Eitel）及湛約翰（John Chalmers）對鄺日修評價甚高。\n\n\n鄺日修在倫敦會任宣教師七年後，於1883年加入聖公會任宣教師。1883年7月8日被按立為會吏，是聖公會在港按立的第二位華人聖品人員。1884年3月9日再被按立為牧師，接替當時已經年邁的羅心源，主理聖士提反堂的事工。鄺日修於1902年遷居九龍後，積極參與教會事工，大力推動九龍城及附近地區的宣教及慈惠事業，對聖三一堂牧區的建立，貢獻重大。\n\n\n在聖三一堂事奉時，鄺日修牧師於1902年開辦了廣蔭院（Almshouse），以服務貧苦、病疾及無助老人為宗旨。後來增設天國救道堂。1903年，鄺日修聯同其他倫敦會、浸信會華人牧者聯名上書香港政府，希望在九龍撥地建華人基督教墳場。1904年政府批地，成為九龍首個華人基督教墳場。1906年，他在九龍寨城建聖保羅小學（後易名天國小學），專收容貧苦少年，教授普通科及工藝知識。\n\n\n鄺日修亦重視文字工作，著有《真道明辨》、《辨別邪正》及《天道分流》等著作。鄺牧師於1921年1月20日安息，享年81歲。\n\n\n**(4) Wong Anang (王謙如)**  \n\n(Source: Li Zhigang, 2014: 133–136; Zhang Zhiwei, 2005: 143–180)  \n\n(4) 王謙如 Wong Anang（李志剛2014：133-136；張志偉2005：143-180）\n\n\n**Wong Anang (1847–1907)**  \n\n\nWong Anang, born in Hong Kong in 1847, hailed from Dongguan, Guangdong. His father, Wong Yuan-shen, was the first preacher of the Rhenish Mission, and his elder brother was Wong Yuk-chu. As a young man, Wong graduated from the Rhenish Mission School and aspired to become a preacher. He studied theology under Ferdinand Genahr and Adam Jrolczyk. Wong graduated from the missionary school in 1866 and was ordained as a pastor in Yongfu in 1884. Over the years, he established churches in nearly ten locations, including:  \n\n\n- 1877: Sun Wai Church  \n\n- 1879: Fuyong, Dongguan, Xin'an  \n\n- 1881: Shijia Village  \n\n- 1886: Dongguan  \n\n- 1895: Kaijingbei Church  \n\n- 1896: Tangxia Yeshan  \n\n- 1897: Taiping  \n\n- 1898: Hong Kong  \n\n- 1902: Shiqi  \n\n- 1906: Daliang Dalang  \n\n\nWong made significant contributions to the early missionary efforts of the Rhenish Mission.  \n\n\nIn 1898, while recuperating in Hong Kong, Wong noticed that many believers from Dongguan and Bao’an had moved to Hong Kong, congregating in the Sai Ying Pun area. He used a missionary's residence on Bonham Road West as a venue for Sunday sermons. After recovering, he returned to preach in Xiangshan, Shiqi, Daliang, and Xiaolan. In 1906, he settled in Hong Kong and participated in the planning and construction of the Rhenish Mission Church. Wong passed away in October 1907 at the age of 61. The church building was completed in 1911, laying the foundation for the Rhenish Mission’s development in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nBeyond preaching, Wong deeply reflected on the relationship between Christianity and Chinese culture. He moved beyond the \"Accommodation Theory\" and \"Supplementary Theory,\" striving to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity in all aspects over Confucianism—a perspective he called the \"Transcendence Theory.\" He argued that Christianity was incomparable to Confucianism and firmly believed that Christian faith could lead to national prosperity and strength. Wong contributed articles to *The Church News* and *A Review of the Times*. In his later years, he authored works such as *Christian and Confucian Monthly Commentary* and *The Measure of Three Religions*.  \n\n\n王謙如（1847-1907），廣東東莞人，1847年生於香港，父親是禮賢會首位傳道王元深，兄長王煜初。少年在禮賢會學堂畢業，後立志傳道，隨葉納清（Ferdinand Genahr）及公孫惠（Adam Jrolczyk）習神科。1866年傳教學校畢業，1884年於永福受按立為牧師。先後於近十處地方建立教會（1877年：新圍聖會； 1879年：福永、東莞、新安；1881年：石家村；1886年：東莞；1895 年：開逕背聖會；1896年：塘廈耶山；1897年：太平；1898年：香港；1902年：石歧；1906年：大良大欖） ，對禮賢會早期傳道事工，作出重大貢獻。\n\n\n1898年寓港養病期間，見東莞、寶安信徒來港謀生者眾，聚居西營盤一帶，乃在般含道西教士養病住所洋房開房，作主日講道之所。王謙如康復後，回到香山、石歧、大良、小欖等地佈道。1906年來香港定居後，參與禮賢會堂的籌建。1907年10月離世，亨年61歲。1911年，禮賢會堂落成，為該會在香港發展，奠下根基。\n\n\n除傳道外，王謙如對基督教與中國文化關係，亦多有省思，他在「合儒論」與「補儒論」外，更力圖闡明基督教各在各方面均優於勝家，儒家不能與基督教比擬（超儒論）。不僅如此，他更深信，基督教信仰有助國家富強。曾於《教會新報》及《萬國公報》刊文，晚年著作有《耶儒月旦》、《三教度鍼》等。\n\n\n**(5) Anna M. Deane (田安娜)**  \n\n(Source: Ye Xianqin, 2021: 69–70; Dai Guanhao, 2020: 89–96)  \n\n(5) 田安娜 Anna M. Deane（葉先秦2021：69-70；戴觀豪 2020：89-96）\n\n\n**Anna M. Deane (田安娜, ?–1918)**  \n\n\nAnna M. Deane arrived in Hong Kong in December 1909 as a member of the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church from Virginia, USA. After her arrival, she assisted Alfred G. Garr at the \"Missionary Home,\" serving as the matron of the women's dormitory. In April 1910, she collaborated with Mok Lai Chi to establish the \"Pentecostal English School,\" where she served as the head teacher.  \n\n\nIn February 1911, Deane felt a calling to evangelize among fishermen. In September 1912, she set up a mission base for fishermen in Shau Kei Wan, founding the \"American Pentecostal Mission.\" The mission included a chapel, a school, and a Sunday school. Additionally, she organized waterborne evangelism, regularly taking a small boat to preach the gospel to fishermen.  \n\n\nIn 1915, the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church merged with the Pentecostal Holiness Church, and the Shau Kei Wan chapel became the first Pentecostal Holiness Church in Hong Kong. Deane passed away in Hong Kong in 1918.  \n\n田安娜（Anna M. Deane, ?–1918），1909年12月抵達香港時，屬於美國維珍尼亞州會幕五旬節會（Tabernacle Pentecostal Church）。來港後，曾協助嘉活力（Alfred G. Garr）「宣教士訓練之家」（Missionary Home），任女舍監。1910年4月，與莫禮智合作開設「婦孺英文書塾」（Pentecostal English School），任首席教師（head teacher）。\n\n\n1911年2月，田方娜有感動要將福音傳給漁民，1912年9月以筲箕灣為漁民宣教據點，成立「美國五旬節會」（American Pentecostal Mission）。筲箕灣堂又設學校，並開辦主日學。同時，又有水面佈道，每週定期乘舢舨向漁民傳福音。\n\n\n1915年會幕五旬節會與五旬節聖潔會（Pentecostal Holiness Church）合併，筲箕灣堂成為五旬節聖潔會在港首間堂會。1918年，田安娜在香港病逝。\n\n\n**(6) Mok Lai Chi (莫禮智)**  \n\n(Source: Ye Xianqin, 2021: 66–75; Dai Guanhao, 2020: 76–99)  \n\n(6) 莫禮智Mok Lai Chi（葉先秦2021：66-75；戴觀豪2020：76-99）\n\n\n**Mok Lai Chi (莫禮智, 1867–1926)**  \n\n\nMok Lai Chi, a native of Xin'an, Guangdong, was born into a Christian family. His father, Mok Wai Kam, was involved in promoting the self-reliance of To Tsai Church. Mok graduated from Queen's College and worked as a civil servant, serving as a clerk at the Observatory, a police interpreter, and the chief translator for the Chinese Secretariat. He was originally a deacon and Sunday school principal at the American Congregational Church. Additionally, he founded Lok Kwan School, where he taught English to over 100 students.  \n\n\nIn 1907, Mok was hired as an interpreter for Alfred G. Garr. On November 10, 1907, he became the second individual to receive Spirit Baptism, making him a pioneer and founding figure of the Pentecostal movement in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nThe church was initially named the \"Apostolic Faith Church\" but was renamed the \"Hong Kong Pentecostal Mission\" in 1910. In 1908, Mok launched the first Chinese Pentecostal publication, *The Pentecostal Truth*, introducing Pentecostal beliefs in Chinese for the first time. He also established the Hong Kong Pentecostal Mission as a self-reliant Chinese church, playing a critical role in its growth and development.  \n\n莫禮智（1867–1926），廣東新安人，生於基督教家庭，父親莫惠錦曾庭曾參與推動道濟會堂的自立。畢業於皇仁書院，任職政府公務員（天文台書記、警屬通譯、華民政務司總翻譯）。原為美華自理會執事及主日學校長。開設樂群書塾，教授英文，學生多達百人。1907年，因受聘為嘉活力（Alfred G. Garr）傳譯，不僅成為第二位接受靈洗的信徒（1907年11月10日），更是香港五旬宗運動的先驅及開山祖。\n\n\n教會初期稱「使徒信心會」，1910年改名「香港五旬節會」。1908年創辦首份中文五旬宗報刊《五旬節真理報》，首次將五旬節信仰以中文呈現。同時，他又將香港五旬節會界定為華人自立教會，對於香港五旬節會的發展，扮演舉足輕重的角色。\n\n\n**(7) Sung Teng Man (宋鼎文)**  \n\n(Source: Ye Xianqin, 2021: 67–80; Dai Guanhao, 2020: 76–97)  \n\n(7) 宋鼎文 Sung Teng Man（葉先秦2021：67-80；戴觀豪 2020：76-97）\n\n\n**Sung Teng Man (宋鼎文, 1883–1958)**  \n\n\nSung Teng Man, a second-generation Christian, was baptized during his childhood in Guangzhou and later joined the American Congregational Church in Hong Kong. In 1901, after the completion of the new church building, disputes arose between Chinese members and the missionary society over property rights. Dissatisfied with how the issue was handled, Sung left the church.  \n\n\nIn 1907, when the Pentecostal movement reached Hong Kong, Pastor A. G. Garr and his wife arrived and borrowed the American Congregational Church on Ladder Street for meetings. They emphasized teachings on repentance, forgiveness, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Sung, who accompanied his wife to these gatherings, experienced a renewed infilling of the Holy Spirit and became the third believer to receive Spirit Baptism (on November 15, 1907). However, opponents accused the group of heresy and prohibited others from attending their services. In response, Garr, Mok Lai Chi, and Sung Teng Man co-founded the Pentecostal Mission (initially named the Apostolic Faith Church).  \n\n\nAfter Mok Lai Chi passed away in 1926, Sung became the leader of the church. In 1939, following his retirement from a senior civil service position, he was ordained as a pastor. Sung guided the church through the three years and eight months of Japanese occupation during World War II. He passed away in 1958.  \n\n\nFollowing his death, the Kowloon branch of the Pentecostal Mission experienced a split, leading some members to establish the \"Kowloon Pentecostal Church.\" A legal battle over property rights ensued.  \n\n宋鼎文（1883-1958），第二代基督徒，幼年於廣州受洗，後來港參加美華自理會。1901年，美華自理會新堂落成後，未幾華人與差會就產權問題出現爭執，宋不滿差會處理而離開教會。1907年，五旬節運動傳入香港時，嘉活力（A. G. Garr）牧師夫婦來港，商借樓梯街美華會堂聚會，強調認罪悔改，聖靈施洗的教導，宋由於陪同妻子參與聚會，經歷聖靈重滿，是第三位接受靈洗的信徒（1907年11月15日）。但不久反對者即斥為異端，禁止人赴會聽道。嘉活力與莫禮智及宋鼎文等即創立五旬節會（初名使徒信心會）。\n\n\n1926年，莫禮智離世後，宋成為教會領導人。1939年自政府高級公務員退休後，被按立為牧師。宋帶領教會經歷日治三年零八個月，至1958年離世。宋離世後，五旬節會九龍支堂出現分裂，信徒另立「九龍五旬節會」，並就產權問題對薄公堂。\n\n\n**(8) Fok Ching Shan (霍靜山)**  \n\n(Source: Liu Yue Sheng, 1996: 327–329; Chen Rui Wen, 2023: 47–59; Samuel, 1919: 17–18)  \n\n(8) 霍靜山 Fok Ching Shan（劉粵聲1996：327-329；陳睿文2023：47-59；撒母耳1919： 17-18）\n\n\n**Fok Ching Shan (霍靜山, 1851–1918)**  \n\n\nFok Ching Shan, born in 1851 in Shunde, Guangdong, moved to Hong Kong as a child and later decided to pursue theological studies. He enrolled in St. Paul’s Theological School under the Anglican Church in Hong Kong, where he remained as a teacher after graduation. Alongside teaching, he assisted with missionary work at St. Stephen’s Church.  \n\n\nIn 1902, when Pastor Matthew A-Jet (鄺日修) relocated to Kowloon to oversee the ministry at Holy Trinity Church, the need for a parish rector became urgent. At that time, Pastor A-Jet was managing both St. Stephen’s Church and Holy Trinity Church. In 1903, Fok was ordained as a deacon and became a pastor the following year, succeeding Matthew A-Jet as the rector of St. Stephen’s Church. During his tenure, Fok established a parish council to promote church autonomy and encouraged congregants to contribute financially to achieve self-sufficiency.  \n\n\nFok also established a women’s Bible school within the church to train female evangelists. Beyond St. Stephen’s Church, he managed All Saints’ Church in Yau Ma Tei and the newly established St. Paul’s Church. He also founded the Joint Parish Council, where he served as vice-chairman. Fok dedicated 50 years of his life to church service.  \n\n\nFok Ching Shan passed away in March 1918 at the age of 67. His passing was deeply mourned by the church community, with thousands of clergy and believers attending his funeral. On March 9, 1919, Bishop Gerald H. Lander of the Diocese of Hong Kong and South China presided over the dedication of a memorial plaque for Fok Ching Shan, recognizing his significant contributions to the church.  \n\n霍靜山（1851-1918），廣東順德人，年幼時受港，後立志攻讀神學。來港入讀聖公會聖保羅神學校學習，畢業後即留校任教。教學之餘，亦協助聖士提反堂宣道事工。1902年，鄺日修遷居九龍，負責九龍聖堂（聖三一堂）事工。隨著香港教區議會（The Chinese Anglican Church Body）在1902年成立，牧區議會亦正式組成。此時，最逼切的需要，是牧區主任牧師的人選。一直以來，鄺日修牧師須兼任香港兩所教會（聖士提反及九龍聖堂）的堂主任。1902年間，鄺牧師正式調離聖士提反堂，遷居九龍半島，全時間投入九龍聖堂（聖三一堂）的事奉。1903年霍靜山封會吏，翌年按立為牧師，接替鄺日修牧師主理聖士提反堂。任內成立牧區議會，推動教會自理，又鼓勵信徒奉獻，以謀自養。此外，他在堂內成立婦女聖經學校，培養女傳道人。除聖士提反堂外，他又兼理油麻地諸聖堂及後來新建的聖保羅堂。又成立牧區聯合議會，任副主席。服務教會長達50年。\n\n\n1918年3月，霍靜山牧師去世，終年六十七歲，由於他深得教會中人敬重，各公會牧師及信徒紛紛到場弔慰，達千人之多。1919年3月9日，港粵轄境倫治華主教（Bishop Gerald H. Lander）為霍靜山牧師立紀念碑並主持開幕禮，高度肯定霍靜山對教會的貢獻。\n\n\n**(9) Yung Park (翁挺生)**  \n\n(Source: Liu Rui Tao, 1975: 25–32)  \n\n（9）翁挺生 Yung Park（劉瑞滔1975：25-32 ）\n\n\n**Yung Park (翁挺生, 1865–1955)**  \n\n\nBorn in Taishan, Guangdong, Yung Park traveled to Hong Kong at the age of 17 before working in the gold mines of San Francisco for four years. He later transitioned to working as a laborer. During this time, he encountered Christianity while studying English at a Gospel Hall and was baptized at the Bethany Chapel in San Francisco in December 1891. The following year, he moved to New York for work and began attending the Congregational Church's True Seeking Hall.  \n\n\nAfter five years, feeling the need to bring the Gospel to his hometown, Yung raised over 800 gold dollars from fellow believers and returned to Taishan, where he established a Gospel Hall near a temple. In 1903, he moved to Hong Kong and was appointed to the American Congregational Church on Ladder Street. He was ordained as a pastor in 1904.  \n\n\nIn 1912, the American Congregational Church was renamed the \"Chinese Congregational Church.\" Under Yung’s leadership, the church established branches in Foshan, Mong Kok, Taishan, Zhongshan, Causeway Bay, and Shau Kei Wan. In 1918, he was elected as the chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Council, becoming the first Chinese to hold this position since the council's founding in 1915.  \n\n\nYung retired in 1947 due to a brain illness and passed away in February 1955 at the age of 91.  \n\n翁挺生（1865–1955），廣東台山人，17歲經香港到金山礦場工作四年，後轉當雜工。期間在福音堂學英文而接觸基督教，1891年12月於三藩市伯大尼禮拜堂受洗。翌年轉到紐約打工，並參與公理會求真堂聚會。五年後，有感家鄉福音需要，乃向同道籌得八百餘金回到台山廟邊，建立福音堂。1903年來港，受聘於美華自理會樓梯街堂，1904年按立為牧師。1912年，美華自理會易名「中華公理會」，帶領教會先後於佛山、旺角、台山、中山、銅鑼灣、筲箕灣成立支堂。1918年，當選為香港基督教聯會主席，是該會自1915年成立以來，首位華人主席。1947年因患腦病退休。1955年2月離世，享年91歲。 \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\n(1) Ma Ying-Biu and the Founding of Sincere Department Store, 1900\n\n(Lee Chi-Kwong 2006: 13-30; Wong Kin-Fai 2015)\n\nMa Ying-Biu (1864–1944), born in Xiangshan, Guangdong, in 1864, worked as a miner in Australia before founding the Wing Sang Company in Sydney. In 1894, he was baptized at the Sydney Chinese Presbyterian Church and later moved to Hong Kong, where he married Ho Hing-Tong, the second daughter of Anglican pastor Ho Ching-Shan. He also established Wing Cheong Gold Mountain Firm. In Hong Kong, Ma participated in the Anglican Church and was a founding member of the Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong. In 1900, he established Sincere Company, the first Western-style department store in Hong Kong, located on Queen’s Road. Ma emphasized \"business as a means of spreading the gospel.\" He passed away in Hong Kong in 1944.\n\nThe initial shareholders of Sincere Company included 13 overseas Chinese merchants from Australia, the Americas, and Xiangshan, many of whom were members of the To Tsai Church or the Chinese Congregational Church and also served as directors of the Chinese YMCA. The company established the Moral Education Department (1907), Intellectual Education Department (1911), and Hui Ai Society (1922). The Moral Education Department aimed to cultivate employees’ ethics and spread Christian teachings. The Intellectual Education Department offered evening classes to train business talent, while the Hui Ai Society collected donations from staff to fund charitable activities.\n\nAs a devout Christian, Ma ensured that Sincere Department Store closed on Sundays to allow employees to attend church services. The store set a precedent for the modern department store industry, earning Ma the title \"Father of Chinese Department Stores.\" Sincere was followed by the establishment of other major stores in Hong Kong, including True Light Department Store, Wing On Department Store (1907, founded by Kwok Chuen of the Chinese Congregational Church), and The Sun Company (1911, founded by Choi Cheong and Choi Hing of the Hop Yat Church). These \"Four Major Stores\" were all operated by Christian businessmen returning from Australia and America.\n\nFrom December 1922 to January 1923, during John Mott’s visit to Hong Kong, the Four Stores’ managers hosted a banquet at the Hongkong Hotel for Mott and local church leaders (Wah Tsz Yat Po, 1923).\n\n\n(2) John R. Mott’s Evangelistic Visit to Hong Kong, 1901\n\n(Yip Cham-Ming 2014: 88)\n\nJohn R. Mott (1865–1955), General Secretary of the World Student Christian Federation (W.S.C.F.), was a long-time leader of the YMCA and the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. During his 1901 visit to China, Mott spent two days in Hong Kong. Local Chinese churches organized two large-scale youth-focused evangelistic meetings.\n\nThe first meeting was held at Queen’s College, attracting around 400 to 500 attendees. Since the colonial government prohibited religious activities in government schools, follow-up counseling sessions were held at To Tsai Church, resulting in eight young people converting to Christianity. The second meeting drew 600 to 700 attendees, with 57 conversions. This marked the first large-scale gospel movement in Hong Kong.\n\n\n(3) Joint Publication of The Chinese Christian Monthly, 1908\n\n(Hing Fook-Tsang 2014b: 229-230)\n\nPublished in 1908, The Chinese Christian Monthly was a collaborative effort by three German missionary societies: the Basel Mission, the Rhenish Mission (Barmen), and the Berlin Mission. Edited by I. Genahr, a missionary of the Hong Kong Rhenish Church, the journal was produced at the Rhenish Mission office in Hong Kong and published twice a month.\n\nThe journal’s mission statement emphasized fostering unity among the three societies, likening their cooperation to \"a connecting cord gradually bringing harmony.\" Content included theological discussions, church news, biographies, novels, and general reports. Most contributors were Chinese pastors affiliated with the three societies, such as Mak Mui-Sang, Wong Yuen-Shum, and Cheung Sing-Wah.\n\nThe Basel and Rhenish Missions were active in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, with strong denominational ties reflected in the journal’s content. However, from July 1908, the journal expanded its reach by involving other denominations, such as the Wesleyan Church (represented by Chan Chuk-Nam) and To Tsai Church (represented by Cheung Chuk-Ling).\n\nDespite these efforts, The Chinese Christian Monthly ceased publication at the end of 1911 after four years. Subscription numbers had declined from a peak of 1,200 to fewer than 1,000, and editor Genahr planned to return to Germany in the spring of 1912, leaving no successor to continue the work.\n\n\n(1) 基督徒馬應彪創辨先施百貨公司 1900（李志剛2006：13-30；黃建輝2015）\n\n\n馬應彪（1864–1944），廣東香山人，1864年出生，後遠赴澳洲當礦工謀生，又在悉尼創立永生公司。1894年於雪梨華人長老會受洗，同年來港，與聖公會霍靜山牧師二女霍慶棠結婚，並創立永昌金山莊。馬在香港參加聖公會，並為香港中華基督教青年會創會會員。1900年在皇后大道創辦先施公司，是香港首間西式百貨公司，重視「藉商傳道」。1944年在港病逝。\n\n\n先施公司首批集資股東包括澳洲、美洲華僑及香山商人合共13人，其中多人均為道濟會堂或美華自理會信徒，亦兼任中華基督教青年會董事。因此，公司先後設德育部（1907）、智育部（1911）、惠愛會（1922）。德育部「以裁培同人道德為宗旨，並以闡揚基督真理，指引同人向道為依歸」。智育部則開設夜學，培養商業人才。至於惠愛會，則由公取同人捐款作基金，以利息作為慈善之用。由於馬應彪是基督徒，故先施百貨在禮拜日休業一天，讓員工可以到教會參加主日崇拜。\n\n\n先施公司的成立，開近代百貨業之先河，馬應彪也有「中國百貨商業之父」之譽。此後，真光百貨公司、永安百貨公司（1907，郭泉〔美華自理會〕創辦）及大新百貨公司（1911，蔡昌、蔡興〔合一堂〕創辦）先後在香港開設，均由澳美歸僑基督徒商人營辦，稱「四大公司」。1922年12月至1923年1月初，艾迪來港演講，期間四大公司司理董事等人，曾於大東酒店宴請艾迪及香港教會領袖（華字日報1923）。\n\n\n(2) 穆德訪港佈道1901（葉琛銘2014：88）\n\n\n穆德（John R. Mott，1865-1955）是世界基督徒學生聯盟（World Student Christian Federation，W.S.C.F.）總幹事、長期領導基督教青年會（Y.M.C.A.）和學生志願宣教運動（Student Volunteer Movement）。1901年藉訪問中國之便，抽出兩天時間訪問香港。香港華人教會為穆德安排兩場大型演講，對象是年青人。第一場在皇仁書院舉行，約有400至500人參與。由於港府禁止在政府學校進行宗教活動，因此大會商借道濟會堂進行陪談聚會，八位年青人歸信。另一場演講則有600至700人參與，其中57名年青人皈信。這是香港首次舉辦大型的福音運動。\n\n\n(3) 三巴會聯合出版《德華朔望報》1908（邢福增2014b：229-230）\n\n\n《德華朔望報》於1908年創刊，是一份由三個德國背景的差會（巴色會、禮賢會〔巴冕〕及巴陵會）合作出版的報刊，由香港禮賢會傳教士葉道勝（I. Genahr）負責主編，並以香港禮賢會為編輯所，每月出版兩冊。〈本報宗旨〉指出，該報的出版，主要希望「使三會有如聯絡之善帶，帶能漸合為一耳」，使「三會之人，知會名雖相異，而心則相印」。在內容方面，除經義的闡釋外，又有教務、小說、傳記、教會新聞等。撰稿者方面，大多為三會的華人教牧（如麥梅生、王元深、張聲和等）。\n\n\n巴色會、禮賢會及巴陵會均屬來華信義宗差會，並以廣東省為宣教區，其中巴色會及禮賢會均在香港傳教。故此，內容方面除一般教會及教義問題討論外，有較強烈的宗派色彩，對了解三會在華南地區的發展，裨益其大。不過，雖然該報有較強的宗派形象，但自1908年7月起，得到香港惠斯禮會陳祝南任代理人，數月後，再增加道濟會堂的張祝齡。從惠斯禮會堂及倫敦會道濟會堂願意擔任代理人可見，反映出該報雖仍具宗派形象，但又希望開拓宗派外的讀者。\n\n\n不過，1911年12月底，《德華朔望報》在出版四年後宣告停刊。究其原因，除訂閱數目從高峰期的1200份降至不足千份外，更重要的是主編葉道勝將於1912年春回國，「接理無人，不得己停辦耳」。 \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n(1) Non-Mainstream Pentecostal Movement\n\n(Yip Sin-Chuen 2021; Dai Koon-Ho 2020; Au 2019)\n\nIn the 1900s, alongside the Azusa Street Revival, the Pentecostal movement gained momentum, with Pentecostal missionaries arriving in Hong Kong. Undoubtedly, Hong Kong became one of the key regions for introducing the Pentecostal movement to China (Bays 1995: 129).\n\nThe Pentecostal movement in Hong Kong began in 1907 when Alfred G. Garr and his wife arrived, leading to the establishment of the Hong Kong Pentecostal Mission, a Chinese self-supporting church founded by Mok Lai-Chi and Sung Ting-Man. By the end of 1909, Anna M. Deane (?–1918) of the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church arrived in Hong Kong and gradually focused on ministering to fishermen, founding the American Pentecostal Mission, later renamed the Pentecostal Holiness Church.\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, other Pentecostal denominations, including the Assemblies of God, the Apostolic Faith Mission, and the Foursquare Gospel Church, established their presence in Hong Kong. These developments created a diverse Pentecostal landscape in the city.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the Pentecostal movement faced significant resistance from mainstream churches in Hong Kong, often labeled as heretical. However, by the 1920s, it began to gain acceptance from traditional denominations. According to a brief history of Pentecostal churches (Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union 1993: 189), \"In the early days, this church was mistakenly regarded by other believers in Hong Kong as heretical and was isolated. However, by 1927, the Hong Kong Christian Churches Union formally invited the church to join as a member congregation.\"\n\n\n(1)非主流傳統五旬節運動（葉先秦2021；戴觀豪 2020；Au 2019）\n\n\n1900年代，伴隨著亞蘇撒街復興，五旬節運動的興起，五旬宗背景的傳教士也來到香港。毋庸置疑，香港是五旬節運動入華的其中一個重要區域（Bays 1995:129）。香港五旬節運動，肇始於1907年嘉活力（Alfred G. Garr）夫婦抵港，並由莫禮智及宋鼎文成立華人自立的「香港五旬節會」。1909年底，會幕五旬節會（Tabernacle Pentecostal Church）的田安娜（Anna M. Deane, ?–1918）來港後，逐漸確立以漁民為宣教目標，建立「美國五旬節會」（後改稱五旬節聖潔會）。1920年代至1940年代，神召會（Assembly of God）、使徒信心會及四方福音會傳教士先後抵港開基，一幅多元的香港五旬宗運動圖像於焉建立起來。五旬節運動在二十世紀初入香港，受到主流教會的抵制，甚至被扣上「異端」之污名。不過，到二十年代以降，已漸獲主流教派接納。據五旬節堂的簡史（華人基督教聯會1993：189）指出，「本會成立初期，曾遭本港其他信徒誤認完全福音為異端而孤立」，但到1927年，香港基督教聯會「特別來函邀請本會加入聯會為會員堂」。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nThis decade did not witness any prominent anti-Christian leaders.\n\n此十年未有明顯反基督教的領袖 \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nThis decade did not witness any prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年未有明顯反基督教的組織 \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n### (1) **Conflict Between Evangelism and Traditional Culture in the New Territories**  \n\n(Lu Pui-Yee 2009)\n\n\nAfter the establishment of the **New Territories Evangelization Society**, the mission inevitably encountered resistance from traditional village religious cultures during its evangelistic efforts. For example, the 1910 annual report mentioned significant challenges faced by missionaries preaching in Sheung Shui. In one village, a family that chose to convert to Christianity was ostracized by other villagers. The father and son of the family were unable to sustain their livelihood within the village.\n\n\nThe 1912 report further noted that there remained strong opposition to Christianity in the villages of Sheung Shui. A colporteur who traveled around Yuen Long distributing religious books, along with his family, was driven out by villagers. The house they lived in was even barricaded.\n\n\nLater, tensions arose between the New Territories Evangelization Society and villagers in Tsuen Wan. At the time, not every household owned weighing tools for goods, so public scales were provided for villagers to weigh items such as pineapples and pork. Villagers paid a fee for this service, and the collected funds were used to maintain local temples. However, some villagers who converted to Christianity objected to their money being used to repair what they considered \"pagan\" temples and refused to pay the fees. This refusal sparked dissatisfaction and led to boycotts by other villagers.\n\n\nThe tensions and conflicts between the New Territories Evangelization Society and traditional village society illustrate the inevitable challenges faced by Christianity as it sought to spread within Chinese communities.\n\n\n(1)新界宣教與傳統文化的衝突（盧佩儀2009）\n\n\n新界傳道會成立後，在新界地區宣教過程中，難免會受到鄉村傳統宗教文化的排斥。例如在1910年的年報中，曾提及及傳教士在上水傳福音遇到相當的困難。在他們接觸的村落中，有一家庭因着願意成為基督徒，導致整個家庭遭到其他村民的杯葛，家庭中的父親和兒子，不能在村內繼續維持生計。1912年的報告再提及在上水的村落裏，仍然有強烈反對基督教信仰的氣氛。有一位在元朗到處傳教的派聖書員，他及其家人被村民驅趕，他們所居住的屋甚至被封鎖。\n\n\n後來，新界傳道會在荃灣又與村民發生張力。當時不是每家每戶都有秤貨物的工具，所以村內設置公秤為村民秤菠蘿及豬肉等物品，然後向村民收取金錢，所收取的金錢是用作維修寺廟之用。及後，有皈信了基督教的村民，不滿那些金錢用作維修所謂異教的廟宇時，他們拒絕付錢，因此便惹來其他村民的不滿，引起杯葛行動。\n\n\n新界傳道會與傳統社會間的張力與矛盾，可說是基督教在華人社會傳播時，必然面對的挑戰。 ",
