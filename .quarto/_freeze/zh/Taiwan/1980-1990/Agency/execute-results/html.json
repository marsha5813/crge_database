He initially worked as a foreign affairs police officer but later converted to Christianity under the missionary work of Helen Elizabeth Gilkerson. He began participating in Bible study sessions at Gilkerson’s Bilaka Church in Hsinchu and subsequently enrolled in the Baptist Theological Seminary.  \n\n\nAfter graduating, he pioneered Miaoli Baptist Church in 1958, the first Hakka-speaking Baptist church in Taiwan. He later worked with Campus Crusade for Christ, promoting the booklet *The Four Spiritual Laws* as part of Taiwan’s \"Evangelistic Explosion\" movement, which helped him establish connections with numerous churches.  \n\n\nIn 1974, Dai attended a large-scale prayer gathering in South Korea, where he witnessed 1.5 million people praying for their nation, which deeply moved him. Inspired by this, he began overnight prayer meetings in 1975, starting with just four people in his home. The gatherings quickly grew, sometimes accommodating 20 to 30 people in a small space, praying continuously day and night. After another visit to Korea in 1978, he envisioned establishing large-scale prayer venues in Taiwan similar to Korea's prayer mountains.  \n\n\nIn 1981, Yeh Rong-chao, a believer who had accompanied Dai to Korea, responded to this vision by donating land near Tanwen Lake in Zaoqiao Township, Miaoli County, to build a prayer mountain. In June of the same year, the site was officially named the \"China Christian Prayer Institute,\" with Dai serving as its director.  \n\n\nThis institution played a crucial role in the development of Protestantism in Taiwan from the 1980s to the 2000s, particularly in advancing the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. It also significantly influenced indigenous churches. Many pastors and believers from indigenous congregations, such as the Amis Guangfu Church (now Mataian Church), the Bunun Qingshui Church, the Mayuan Church, the Paiwan Caopu Holiness Church, and the Atayal Tianpu Church, participated in gatherings at the prayer mountain. These experiences exposed them to the charismatic dimension of the Holy Spirit's work, which subsequently shaped their respective churches. Moreover, various \"prayer mountains\" and \"prayer institutes\" across indigenous communities were largely inspired by this movement (Shih 2012a: 120-132; Yeh 2012: 93; Rubinstein 1996: 356-357; Tan n.d.: 2-4; Chang 2009: 548-549).\n\n\n蘇南洲（Chris Su, 1953.10.14～2020.2.27）。生於台北，基督徒社會運動者，雅歌出版社與《曠野》雜誌社創辦人兼社長。東海大學建築學士，台灣大學土木所（今建築與城鄉研究所）碩士。其在就讀大學期間歸信基督教，並廣泛接觸文史哲書籍，奠定思想基礎，同時擔任校內基督教刊物《葡萄園》雜誌社長，養成對文字工作的濃厚興趣與使命感。1982年與彭海瑩結婚，婚後開放家庭，成立團契，開始邀集基督教界好友，討論、反思各樣教會與社會議題。1987年與康來新、彭海瑩共同創辦雅歌出版社與《曠野》雜誌，所出版之書籍以及刊登之文章，有別於當時其他基督教報刊，其議題不限於靈修、信徒生活、教會事務，更涉及信仰思辯、社會參與、生態環保、文學藝術、公共神學。他個人積極投身社會公義事務，1989年年底，他發起「聲援劉俠 關懷殘障」研討祈禱會，支持因身障未能升學以致學歷不符考選部認可而未能投入立法委員選舉的著名作家劉俠參選。而後又發起「二二八平安運動／禮拜」、「反雛妓宣言」，並關心環境保護、古蹟保存等議題。1975年蔣介石過世後，若干「黨國基督徒」籌劃在濟南長老教會現址興建「中正紀念教堂」，至1989年已募得建築經費。1988年蘇南洲在撰寫碩士論文時，以濟南教會建築空間為研究議題，意外獲得「中正紀念教堂」的計畫內容，他將資料轉給翁修恭牧師，其覺得事態嚴重，遂告知當時已是總統的李登輝，1990年李登輝指示將該教堂列為古蹟，終止了前述計畫。蘇南洲的碩士論文研究可謂間接阻止「中正紀念教堂」的計畫，讓濟南長老教會的古蹟禮拜堂得以保存。蘇南洲最為人所知的貢獻，要數在1980年代尚未解嚴之前，即開始著手瞭解、關懷二二八受難者家屬。其《曠野》雜誌從1989年初起，每期談論「二二八」，隨後著手籌辦於1990年12月8日舉行的「尊重人權、 紀念二二八」平安禮拜，開啟其推動之「二二八平安運動」的序幕。該運動以和解、關懷受苦者此般較為軟性、柔性的取徑為基調，避免直接衝撞政權，有別於當時長老教會路線所倡「公義與和平，且公義應先於和平」的取徑。後來他也與二二八受難者林茂生之子林宗義共同促成政府公開向二二八受難家屬致歉、賠償，以及設立紀念碑（曾慶豹2016：339-343；彭海瑩2020：1-2；林淑芬2024：55-57；王昭文2010；梁敬彥2020：1）。\n\n\nChris Su (蘇南洲, October 14, 1953 – February 27, 2020)  \n\n\nBorn in Taipei, Chris Su was a Christian social activist, the founder and president of Agape Publishing House and *The Wilderness* magazine. He earned a bachelor's degree in architecture from Tunghai University and a master's degree from National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Civil Engineering (now the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning).  \n\n\nDuring his university years, Su converted to Christianity and extensively engaged with literature, history, and philosophy, which laid the foundation for his intellectual pursuits. He also served as the editor-in-chief of the Christian campus magazine *The Vineyard*, fostering his deep passion and sense of mission for writing. In 1982, he married Peng Hai-ying, and together they opened their home for fellowship, gathering Christian friends to discuss and reflect on various church and social issues.  \n\n\nIn 1987, Su co-founded Agape Publishing House and *The Wilderness* magazine with Kang Lai-hsin and Peng Hai-ying. Unlike other Christian publications at the time, their works extended beyond devotional literature, Christian living, and church affairs to cover faith-based critical thinking, social engagement, environmental conservation, literature, art, and public theology.  \n\n\nSu was actively involved in social justice issues. In late 1989, he organized the \"Support Liu Xia, Care for the Disabled\" seminar and prayer meeting to advocate for the famous disabled writer Liu Xia, who was barred from running for the Legislative Yuan due to academic qualifications requirements. He also initiated the \"February 28 Peace Movement/Worship Service,\" the \"Anti-Child Prostitution Manifesto,\" and supported environmental protection and historic preservation efforts.  \n\n\nIn 1975, after Chiang Kai-shek’s death, certain \"Party-State Christians\" planned to construct the \"Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Church\" on the site of Jinan Presbyterian Church. By 1989, fundraising for the project was nearly complete. While working on his master's thesis in 1988, Su studied the architectural space of Jinan Church and unexpectedly discovered plans for the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Church. He passed the information to Pastor Ong Siu-kiong, who deemed it a serious matter and informed President Lee Teng-hui. In 1990, Lee ordered the church to be designated a historical site, halting the construction project. Su’s thesis research indirectly led to the preservation of Jinan Presbyterian Church’s historic sanctuary.  \n\n\nSu is best known for his advocacy for the families of the victims of the February 28 Incident. Before Taiwan’s martial law was lifted in the late 1980s, he had already begun researching and supporting these families. Beginning in early 1989, *The Wilderness* magazine featured discussions on the February 28 Incident in every issue. This effort culminated in the \"Respect Human Rights, Commemorate 228\" peace worship service on December 8, 1990, marking the beginning of the \"February 28 Peace Movement.\" This movement took a softer, more conciliatory approach centered on reconciliation and care for the suffering, contrasting with the Presbyterian Church’s stance of \"justice and peace, with justice preceding peace.\" Later, Su collaborated with Lin Tsung-yi, the son of February 28 victim Lin Mao-sheng, to push for the government's public apology, compensation for victims' families, and the establishment of a memorial monument (Tseng Ching-pao 2016: 339-343; Peng Hai-ying 2020: 1-2; Lin Shu-fen 2024: 55-57; Wang Chao-wen 2010; Liang Ching-yen 2020: 1).\n\n\n江鵬堅（1940.4.25~2000.12.15）。生於台北。政治家、人權律師，並為民主進步黨創黨十人小組成員與首任黨主席。曾任立法委員、監察委員。1958年考入國立臺灣大學法律系， 1964年通過專門職業及技術人員高等考試律師考試，成為執業律師。1980年美麗島事件被捕者中的部分主要人物被警總軍法處以叛亂罪起訴，在軍事法庭審判中，江鵬堅為林義雄辯護，亦就此展開其政治生涯。1983年當選為立法委員，誓言戒嚴令不除，絕不競選連任。三年任期屆滿後，不忘選先前舉諾言，聲明放棄競選連任。1986年9月，在其參與籌組工作下，民主進步黨正式成立於台北圓山飯店，而當時黨禁尚未解除。同年11月10日，他以一票之差擊敗費希平，當選民進黨的首任黨主席。之所以出現江鵬堅與費希平雙雄競逐的情況，其中一項原因是兩人均為立法委員，國民黨政府不敢貿然逮捕，為新政黨有力的保護傘。1987年立法院制訂「國家安全法」，將容忍民進黨成立的三個條件列入：「不得違背憲法；不得主張共產主義；不得分裂國土」，然而蔣經國仍不承認此一新成立的黨派，在同年年底還曾召見參謀總長郝柏村，指示「軍隊應完成應變準備」。江鵬堅擔任民進黨主席雖然只有一年時間，但為草創的民進黨訂立許多重要制度，例如中央黨部和地方黨部的建立，以及主張黨內民主運作。此外，他也建立黨內協商機制，協調立院黨團與黨工、黨中央之間的衝突，也調停草創時期黨內議會路線和群眾路線的張力。他在卸任黨主席後，陸續擔任立法委員、監察委員，在監察委員任內重新調查林宅血案、美麗島事件、蘇炳坤冤案等重大案件（陳順珍2007：133-183）。江鵬堅在早年常與長老教會人士往來，但是到臨終前始正式受洗歸信。\n\n\nChiang Peng-chien (江鵬堅, April 25, 1940 – December 15, 2000)  \n\n\nBorn in Taipei, Chiang Peng-chien was a politician, human rights lawyer, and a founding member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), serving as its first party chairperson. He was also a legislator and a member of the Control Yuan.  \n\n\nIn 1958, Chiang entered the Department of Law at National Taiwan University. He passed the national bar exam in 1964 and became a practicing lawyer. His political career began in 1980 when he defended Lin Yi-hsiung, one of the main defendants in the *Kaohsiung Incident* trial, where key figures were charged with sedition in a military court.  \n\n\nIn 1983, Chiang was elected as a legislator, vowing not to seek re-election unless martial law was lifted. True to his promise, he declined to run again after his three-year term ended. In September 1986, despite the continued ban on opposition parties, he helped establish the DPP at the Grand Hotel Taipei. On November 10 of the same year, he narrowly defeated Fei Hsi-ping by one vote to become the party’s first chairperson. The competition between Chiang and Fei arose partly because both were legislators, making them less vulnerable to immediate arrest by the Kuomintang (KMT) government, which indirectly provided a degree of protection for the nascent party.  \n\n\nIn 1987, the Legislative Yuan passed the *National Security Law*, which imposed three restrictions on the DPP: it could not violate the Constitution, advocate communism, or promote national division. Nevertheless, President Chiang Ching-kuo refused to recognize the DPP, and by the end of the year, he instructed Chief of the General Staff Hau Pei-tsun to ensure the military was prepared for potential unrest.  \n\n\nAlthough Chiang Peng-chien served as DPP chair for only one year, he played a crucial role in shaping the party’s foundational structure. He established both the central and local party offices and advocated for internal democratic processes. He also created a negotiation mechanism within the party to mediate conflicts between the legislative caucus, party staff, and party leadership, as well as to ease tensions between the parliamentary and grassroots factions.  \n\n\nAfter stepping down as party chair, Chiang continued to serve as a legislator and later as a member of the Control Yuan. During his tenure in the Control Yuan, he reopened investigations into major cases such as the *Lin Family Massacre*, the *Kaohsiung Incident*, and the *Su Bing-kun wrongful conviction case* (Chen Shun-chen 2007: 133-183).  \n\n\nAlthough Chiang frequently interacted with members of the Presbyterian Church in his early years, he formally converted to Christianity and was baptized only shortly before his passing.\n\n\n林宗正（1950.3.4~）出生於台南，為台灣基督長老教會牧師、社會運動者。其父林占鰲受蔡培火影響，加入以文化抗日為目標的台灣文化協會並受洗成為基督徒。林宗正1979年畢業於台南神學院研究所，在學期間受該院老師王憲治的「鄉土神學」影響，另外兩位老師謝秀雄和謝敏川則分別引其進入民主運動領域和台灣URM（Urban Rural Mission 城鄉宣教委員會）組織。1985 年，林宗正出國接受為期一個月的第四屆「基督教城鄉宣教運動（URM）」訓練，此一運動不僅與宣教有關，也涉及非暴力抗爭理念的傳達，他回台後擔任URM主席，以此精神從事社會運動與政治抗爭。1980年起，他開始參與黨外民主運動，先後為美麗島事件受難者家屬演講與助選，曾遭高雄地檢署指控違反選舉罷免法，煽動他人觸犯內亂外患罪，但後來因「罪證不足」不予起訴。同年，他擔任長老教會台南大專中心傳道師，其間帶領學生關懷環保以及原住民的困境，他意識到1970年代後期展開的十大建設中，許多廉價勞工均為原住民，此外，1984年海山煤礦爆炸，許多罹難礦工是原住民。此後他開始投入與原住民議題相關的抗爭運動。例如1987年3月，南投縣政府為了提供土地給觀光飯店蓋停車場之用，遂以「妨礙風景區觀瞻與地方繁榮」為由，將信義鄉東埔村布農族的祖墳挖出，並將屍骨任意曝曬，引發布農族人上街抗議。林宗正當時協助組織街頭抗議，是為首次原住民集體示威遊行抗爭。此外，尤以1988年12月31日「拆除吳鳳銅像事件」最為人知，該次行動由他與十一族原住民代表、長老教會人士與幾位民進黨黨員共同策劃，旨在破除侮辱鄒族原住民的「吳鳳神話」。他與相關人士遭起訴、羈押，後被無罪開釋。在該案件的處理過程中，當時任職於比利時魯汶大學的台獨聯盟成員何康美透過天主教和平公義小組，將此事件轉知教宗若望保祿二世，教宗因此致函總統府。1989年，是時編寫、出版教科書的國立編譯館將吳鳳的故事從教科書刪除，內政部亦將吳鳳鄉改名阿里山鄉。1987年2月25日，鄭南榕發起首場「二二八和平日遊行活動」，林宗正亦參與其中。同年《台灣教會公報》遭警備總部沒收，林宗正發動八十多位牧師上街抗議，而後警總終於同意歸還。1988年，曾因政治因素移民海外的陳翠玉逝世並在台舉行告別禮拜，林宗正刻意引領送葬隊伍向總統府前進，以抗議國民黨政府過去對陳翠玉的迫害。林宗正在1980年多次參與重要抗爭運動，是這段期間台灣基督長老教會神職人員投身社會運動的代表性人物（邱斐顯2012：122-147）。\n\n\nLin Tsung-cheng (林宗正, March 4, 1950 – )  \n\n\nBorn in Tainan, Lin Tsung-cheng is a pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan and a social activist. His father, Lin Chan-ao, was influenced by Tsai Pei-huo and joined the Taiwan Cultural Association, which aimed to resist Japanese rule through cultural activism. He later converted to Christianity.  \n\n\nLin Tsung-cheng graduated from the graduate program at Tainan Theological College and Seminary in 1979. During his studies, he was influenced by Professor Wang Hsien-chih’s *Contextual Theology* and was introduced to the democratic movement by Professor Hsieh Hsiu-hsiung and to Taiwan’s Urban Rural Mission (URM) by Professor Hsieh Min-chuan. In 1985, he traveled abroad to participate in the fourth session of the *Christian Urban Rural Mission (URM)* training, a movement that extended beyond evangelism to include the promotion of nonviolent resistance. After returning to Taiwan, he became the chairman of URM, incorporating its principles into his social activism and political resistance.  \n\n\nSince 1980, Lin was actively involved in the democratic movement outside the KMT’s control, giving speeches and campaigning for the families of those persecuted in the *Kaohsiung Incident*. He was accused by the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office of violating election laws and inciting sedition, but the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence. That same year, he became a minister at the Tainan Presbyterian University Student Center, where he led students in addressing environmental and Indigenous issues. He became increasingly aware that many of the cheap laborers recruited for Taiwan’s *Ten Major Construction Projects* in the late 1970s were Indigenous people. Additionally, after the 1984 Haishan Coal Mine explosion, which claimed many Indigenous workers' lives, he dedicated himself to Indigenous rights advocacy.  \n\n\nOne of his early contributions to Indigenous activism occurred in March 1987 when the Nantou County government forcibly exhumed the ancestral graves of the Bunun people in Dongpu Village, citing their obstruction of a planned parking lot for a tourist hotel. The government left the remains exposed, prompting Indigenous protests. Lin helped organize the demonstration, marking the first large-scale Indigenous protest in Taiwan’s history.  \n\n\nHis most well-known activism took place on December 31, 1988, with the *Removal of the Wufeng Statue*. This protest, planned alongside representatives from eleven Indigenous tribes, members of the Presbyterian Church, and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) members, aimed to dismantle the statue of Wufeng and challenge the discriminatory *Wufeng Myth*, which depicted the Tsou people as savages. Lin and other participants were arrested but were later acquitted. During the case proceedings, Ho Kang-mei, a Taiwan independence advocate based at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, informed Pope John Paul II of the event through the Catholic Peace and Justice Committee, prompting the Pope to send a letter to Taiwan’s Presidential Office. In 1989, the National Institute for Compilation and Translation removed the Wufeng story from school textbooks, and the Ministry of the Interior renamed Wufeng Township as Alishan Township.  \n\n\nOn February 25, 1987, Lin participated in *Cheng Nan-jung’s 228 Peace Memorial March*, the first public commemoration of the February 28 Incident. That same year, when *The Taiwan Church News* was confiscated by the Taiwan Garrison Command, Lin organized a protest involving over eighty pastors, which ultimately pressured the authorities to return the publication.  \n\n\nIn 1988, when political exile Chen Tsui-yu passed away and a funeral service was held in Taiwan, Lin deliberately led the funeral procession toward the Presidential Office to protest the KMT government’s past persecution of Chen.  \n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Lin Tsung-cheng played a crucial role in major protests, making him one of the most representative figures among Presbyterian clergy involved in Taiwan’s social movements (Chiu Fei-hsien 2012: 122-147). \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\n反雛妓運動\n\n1985年台灣基督教長老教會舉辦「觀光與賣春」研討會，在9月份的一次籌備座談會中，「婦女新知」理事長李元貞，建議以教會力量來協助雛妓。促使長老教會彩虹婦女事工中心主任廖碧英在1986年，派員前往台北著名華西街進行實地調查，發現雛妓問題的嚴重性，遂成立「彩虹專案」，開始從事救援雛妓的工作。1987年1月11日，該會和31個婦女人權團體、宗教團體、政治團體，動員一萬五千人在台北華西街發起「關懷雛妓、打擊人口販賣」遊行。這場社會運動所針對的不僅是兒少性剝削、販賣人口問題，實際上更涉及原住民。由於原住民在經濟上的弱勢，許多未滿十六歲的少女，被其父母賣到台北華西街的私娼寮，淪為雛妓。這場反雛妓運動，尤其抗議政府縱容「販賣人口及山地雛妓」，因按照法律：逼良為娼是告訴乃論罪，若無人提出告訴，這些利用雛妓經營各種行業的業者和人口販運者就不會受到法律的制裁。1987年3月，警政署終於在各方的壓力之下，成立了「正風專案」，以取締人口買賣、救援雛妓為任務，但不見警方大力取締和改善。1988的1月9日，以「救援雛妓再出擊」聯名抗議的團體，由31個增加為55個，再度踏入華西街示威抗議。長老教會在這場反雛妓運動扮演重要角色，並成功推動「兒少性交易防治法」（起初名為「雛妓防治法」）迅速在1995年通過（邱萬興2016）。\n\n\nAnti-Child Prostitution Movement (反雛妓運動)  \n\n\nIn 1985, the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) held a seminar titled *Tourism and Prostitution*. During a preparatory meeting in September, Lee Yuan-chen, chairperson of the Awakening Foundation, suggested that churches should take an active role in helping child prostitutes. This proposal prompted Liao Bi-ying, director of the PCT Rainbow Women's Center, to launch an investigation in 1986. Her team conducted field research in Huaxi Street, Taipei's well-known red-light district, uncovering the severity of child prostitution in Taiwan. As a result, the \"Rainbow Project\" was established, initiating efforts to rescue child prostitutes.  \n\n\nOn January 11, 1987, the Presbyterian Church, along with 31 women's rights, religious, and political groups, mobilized 15,000 people to march in Huaxi Street, demanding action under the slogan: *\"Care for Child Prostitutes, Crack Down on Human Trafficking.\"*  \n\n\nThis social movement addressed not only child sexual exploitation and human trafficking but also the plight of Indigenous girls. Many underage Indigenous girls, especially those under 16, were sold by their families—often due to extreme poverty—into brothels in Huaxi Street, where they were forced into prostitution. The Anti-Child Prostitution Movement strongly condemned the government’s tacit approval of human trafficking and Indigenous child prostitution.  \n\n\nAt the time, Taiwanese law treated forced prostitution as a \"complaint-based offense\", meaning that unless a formal complaint was filed, brothel operators and traffickers exploiting child prostitutes could not be prosecuted. This loophole allowed the child prostitution industry to persist with government inaction.  \n\n\nIn March 1987, under mounting public pressure, the National Police Agency launched Project Zhengfeng (正風專案), an initiative aimed at cracking down on human trafficking and rescuing child prostitutes. However, enforcement remained weak and ineffective.  \n\n\nOn January 9, 1988, the movement staged a second \"Rescue Child Prostitutes\" protest, with 55 organizations—up from the original 31—joining the demonstration in Huaxi Street.  \n\n\nThe Presbyterian Church in Taiwan played a crucial role in the Anti-Child Prostitution Movement, ultimately contributing to the passage of the Child and Youth Sexual Transaction Prevention Act in 1995 (initially called the *Child Prostitution Prevention Act*). This marked a major legal victory in the fight against child sexual exploitation in Taiwan (Chiu Wan-hsing 2016).\n\n\n台灣基督長老教會信仰告白發布\n\n1985年4月9日-12日，台灣基督長老教會第三十二屆總會通常年會通過〈台灣基督長老教會信仰告白〉，4月11日全體議員逐句宣讀，並經過三讀通過，在同年5月9日由信仰與教制委員會校定。事實上，早在1918年4月16日第七屆台灣大會時，當時的議長陳清義已提出並在隨後設置「信經起草委員會」，研究信仰告白條文，以送南北中會審議，但後來未有結果。至1978年，該會再次研擬、起草信仰告白，且強調這份信仰告白必須釘根本土，向全臺灣人民表白該會的信仰立場，因此不只是對宗派和教會界內部發出的認信宣言。可謂其來台宣教120年的里程碑。第三段強調教會是「上帝子民的團契，蒙召來宣揚耶穌基督的拯救，做和解的使者，是普世的，且根植於本地，認同所有的住民，通過愛和受苦，而成為盼望的記號」。另外提及「祂要使人從罪惡中得釋放，使受壓制的人得自由、平等，在基督裡成為新創造的人，使世界成為祂的國度，充滿公義、平安與歡喜」（《認識台灣基督長老教會》編輯小組2010：31-32）。這些內容明顯有別於其他多數著重教義正統性、客觀性的信仰宣言，更多注重當下處境，進行一種處境神學的詮釋並付諸實踐。此外，前述內容也呼應1970年代以來台灣基督長老教會的整全信仰關懷，即是將社會公義、政治關懷視為基督教信仰的一部分。\n\n\nThe Confession of Faith of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) (台灣基督長老教會信仰告白發布)  \n\n\nFrom April 9 to 12, 1985, the 32nd General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) passed the *Confession of Faith of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan*. On April 11, all assembly members read it aloud sentence by sentence, and after a third reading, it was officially approved. The final text was confirmed on May 9, 1985, by the Committee on Faith and Church Order.  \n\n\nIn fact, as early as April 16, 1918, during the 7th Taiwan Assembly, Moderator Tan Chheng-gi proposed drafting a confession of faith, leading to the establishment of a Confession Drafting Committee to prepare a statement for review by the North, Central, and South Presbyteries. However, no conclusion was reached at the time.  \n\n\nBy 1978, the PCT reinitiated the drafting process, emphasizing that the confession should be deeply rooted in Taiwan and serve as a public declaration of faith to all Taiwanese people, rather than merely a doctrinal statement for the denomination or the wider Christian community. The adoption of this confession marked the 120th anniversary of the church’s mission in Taiwan, symbolizing a historic milestone.  \n\n\nThe third section of the confession states that the church is a fellowship of God’s people, called to proclaim the salvation of Jesus Christ, to be agents of reconciliation, universal yet locally rooted, identifying with all inhabitants, becoming a sign of hope through love and suffering. It further declares:  \n\n\n*\"He will set people free from sin, bring liberation and equality to the oppressed, renew humanity in Christ, and transform the world into His kingdom, filled with justice, peace, and joy.\"* (*Understanding the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan*, Editorial Team 2010: 31-32).  \n\n\nThis theological stance differs significantly from many other Christian confessions, which primarily emphasize doctrinal orthodoxy and objectivity. Instead, the PCT’s confession places a strong focus on contemporary social contexts, adopting a contextual theological interpretation that is actively practiced.  \n\n\nMoreover, this confession aligns with the PCT’s longstanding commitment to holistic faith, which, since the 1970s, has regarded social justice and political engagement as integral to Christian faith.\n\n\n〈人權宣言〉紀念大會\n\n1987年12月，台灣基督長老教會在全台分區舉辦「人權宣言十週年感恩紀念大會」，是首次紀念〈人權宣言〉的活動，由該會的總會「世界教會關係小組」負責籌劃。各地紀念大會的日期和地點分別為花蓮光復教會（12月6日）、台東更生教會（12月6日）、台北馬偕醫院大禮堂（12月6日）、台中柳原教會（12月13日）、彰化教會（12月13日）、台南市體育館前廣場（12月13日）、鳳山市國父紀念館（12月13日）。此次大會的呼籲是「內求民主改革、內爭獨立國格、政權歸返人民、國會全面改選、實施地方自治、省市長民選、消除文化歧視、建立本土共識、堅持住民自決、開創台灣前途」。台北地區紀念大會由李約翰證道，會後請尤清演講，他主張「建立新而獨立的國家」、「台灣前途除了自決以外無別路」。身為長老教會信徒的立委張俊雄在東部中會南區紀念大會亦提及自決。教會公報社社長李健福在嘉南區紀念大會上呼籲群眾以實際行動關懷因主張台獨而入獄的政治受難者蔡有全和許曹德及其家屬。由一系列活動的發言來看，此一時期長老教會對〈人權宣言〉的詮釋和論述集中在「自決」，認同方面仍然停留在「鄉土」，以及聲援蔡有全、許曹德主張台灣獨立的「言論自由」，尚未明顯表態支持台灣獨立，至1989年鄭南榕自焚事件後，該會立場才正式從「自決」轉向「獨立建國」（鄭睦群2017：125-126）。\n\n\n Commemoration of the 10th Anniversary of the *Declaration on Human Rights* (〈人權宣言〉紀念大會)  \n\n\nIn December 1987, the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) held regional commemorative services across Taiwan to mark the 10th anniversary of its *Declaration on Human Rights* (1977). This was the first official commemoration of the declaration, organized by the PCT General Assembly’s World Church Relations Committee.  \n\n\nThe events were held at the following locations and dates:  \n\n- December 6: Guangfu Church (Hualien), Gengsheng Church (Taitung), Mackay Memorial Hospital Auditorium (Taipei)  \n\n- December 13: Liuyuan Church (Taichung), Changhua Church, Tainan City Stadium Square, National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (Fengshan)  \n\n\n Key Messages and Political Demands  \n\nThe event’s central appeal was:  \n\n*\"Pursue democratic reforms, fight for Taiwan’s independent national status, return political power to the people, hold full parliamentary re-elections, implement local self-governance, elect provincial and municipal governors, eliminate cultural discrimination, establish local consensus, uphold residents’ right to self-determination, and shape Taiwan’s future.\"*  \n\n\n Notable Speakers and Themes  \n\n- In Taipei, the main sermon was delivered by John Lee (李約翰), followed by a speech from You Ching (尤清), who called for the establishment of *\"a new and independent state\"* and declared that *\"Taiwan’s future has no other path but self-determination.\"*  \n\n- In Eastern Taiwan (South District of the East Presbytery), legislator Chang Chun-hsiung (張俊雄), a PCT member, also spoke on the importance of *self-determination*.  \n\n- In the Chia-Nan region, Lee Chien-fu (李健福), director of *Taiwan Church News*, urged participants to take concrete action to support political prisoners Tsai You-chuan (蔡有全) and Hsu Tsao-te (許曹德), who had been imprisoned for advocating Taiwan independence.  \n\n\n PCT’s Interpretation of the *Declaration on Human Rights*  \n\nAt this stage, the PCT’s discourse on human rights focused primarily on self-determination, framing its identity within \"local consciousness\" (鄉土意識) while advocating freedom of speech, particularly in defense of pro-independence voices like Tsai You-chuan and Hsu Tsao-te. However, the church had not yet explicitly endorsed Taiwanese independence as its official stance.  \n\n\nIt was only after the self-immolation of Cheng Nan-jung (鄭南榕) in 1989, who died defending freedom of speech and Taiwan’s independence, that the PCT officially shifted its position from advocating \"self-determination\" to explicitly supporting \"nationhood and independence.\" (Cheng Mu-qun 2017: 125-126).\n\n\n二二八平安禮拜\n\n1990年12月8日晚上七點半，具里程碑意義的「二二八平安禮拜」在懷恩堂舉行。二二八事件在解嚴前的台灣社會，向來是諱莫如深的敏感議題，解嚴後氛圍丕變，各界討論二二八的事例漸增。在教會界亦有一群人士開始從和解的角度談論此一事件，如1989年時任曠野社社長的蘇南洲即有意籌劃「二二八平安禮拜」，他先後得到常為李登輝舉行家庭禮拜的濟南長老教會牧師翁修恭以及蔣介石的家庭牧師周聯華支持，他認為兩人可以調停雙方陣營中的異議。蘇南洲擔任大會總幹事，其曠野社負責主要籌備工作，以「止痛療傷，再造生機」、「承擔苦難與責任，見證基督的愛、接納與饒恕的福音」為主旨進行籌備。曠野社當時成立僅兩年多，卻擔負聯絡二二八遺族之責，更聯合共60 多位教會領袖共同籌備。在當時的時空脈絡下，籌備此般活動並不容易，因其涉及「宗教與政治」、「國語教會與台語教會」的問題。籌辦過程中，有國語教會人士反對「平安禮拜」，甚至寄匿名黑函攻擊周聯華和翁修恭兩位牧師，箇中原因可能是認為此活動過於政治化且偏向本省人；部分長老教會人士則憂慮此活動動機不純，可能會遭國民黨政府利用。10 月19 日籌備會中蘇南洲徵求周、翁兩位牧師同意，分別以自身不甚熟練的台、國語證道，以表示國語教會和台語教會之間的和解，蘇氏表示此為其從建築學領悟出來的一種處理社會上結構性難題的方式。當日兩位牧師的信息圍繞和好與認罪，隨後的環節包括會眾默哀、詩班獻詩、向受難家屬獻花、全體齊唱「以馬內利來臨」，最後以在「平安夜」歌聲中傳遞燭光結束禮拜。行政院長郝柏村、內政部長許水德、總統副秘書長邱進益、民進黨前後任主席施明德與許信良、人權醫師陳永興等人均主動到場，足見此次平安禮拜受到朝野關注，也是台灣教會界對於二二八此一台灣社會集體傷痛做出的回應與貢獻（吳國安2015：71-78）。\n\n\nThe 228 Peace Service  \n\n\nOn the evening of December 8, 1990, at 7:30 PM, the landmark *228 Peace Service* was held at the Wesley Grove Chapel. Prior to the lifting of martial law, the 228 Incident had long been a taboo and sensitive topic in Taiwanese society. However, after martial law was lifted, the atmosphere shifted dramatically, and discussions about the 228 Incident gradually increased across various sectors. Within the church community, some individuals began addressing the event from a perspective of reconciliation. In 1989, Su Nanzhou, then the president of *Wilderness Society*, conceived the idea of organizing a *228 Peace Service*. He gained support from Ong Siu-kiong, the pastor of Jinan Presbyterian Church, who frequently led family worship services for Lee Teng-hui, as well as Chou Lien-hua, the personal pastor of Chiang Kai-shek’s family. Su believed that these two figures could help mediate the differing perspectives between opposing factions.  \n\n\nServing as the secretary-general of the event, Su and *Wilderness Society* took charge of the primary preparations. The event was organized under the themes *\"Healing pain and rebuilding hope\"* and *\"Bearing suffering and responsibility, witnessing Christ’s love, acceptance, and the gospel of forgiveness.\"* At the time, *Wilderness Society* had been established for just over two years, yet it took on the significant task of reaching out to the families of 228 victims. Additionally, over 60 church leaders collaborated in organizing the service. Given the sociopolitical context of the time, planning such an event was not easy, as it involved sensitive issues related to *religion and politics* as well as the *Mandarin-speaking churches and Taiwanese-speaking churches* divide.  \n\n\nDuring the preparation process, some members of Mandarin-speaking churches opposed the *Peace Service*, even sending anonymous letters attacking Pastors Chou Lien-hua and Ong Siu-kiong. The opposition may have stemmed from concerns that the event was overly political and biased toward native Taiwanese. Conversely, some within the Presbyterian Church worried that the event's intentions were not pure and that it might be exploited by the Kuomintang government. At a preparatory meeting on October 19, Su Nanzhou sought the agreement of Pastors Chou and Ong to preach in Taiwanese and Mandarin, respectively, despite their limited proficiency in those languages. This symbolic gesture was meant to demonstrate reconciliation between the Mandarin-speaking and Taiwanese-speaking church communities. Su noted that he drew inspiration for this approach from his architectural background, applying its principles to address structural social challenges.  \n\n\nThe service centered on themes of reconciliation and repentance. The program included a moment of silence, a choral performance, a floral tribute to the families of victims, and a collective singing of *\"O Come, Emmanuel.\"* The service concluded with the congregation passing candlelight to one another while singing *\"Silent Night.\"* Notably, several prominent political figures attended voluntarily, including Premier Hau Pei-tsun, Minister of the Interior Hsu Shui-teh, Presidential Deputy Secretary-General Chiu Chin-i, former and incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairmen Shih Ming-teh and Hsu Hsin-liang, and human rights activist Dr. Chen Yung-hsing. The event garnered significant attention from both the ruling and opposition parties, marking an important response and contribution by Taiwan’s church community to the collective trauma of the 228 Incident. (Wu Guo'an, 2015: 71-78). \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n移位神學\n\n是一種歷史神學觀點，意即強調一種從將聖經中的以色列視為中心的歷史觀到將其他民族也視為上帝歷史構建組成要素的置換、轉移。此觀點由宋泉盛提出，承續其之前強調「道成肉身」概念而來的處境神學論述，他在1980年代進一步指出上帝的道應須有亞洲之「肉身」，以及上帝的救贖對亞洲人民的意義，意即探究古代以色列民族和西方基督教會所體現的救贖歷史對亞洲人民有何具體意義。他主張透過文化故事論來將西方世界的基督教傳統、神學表達方式和複雜的想法轉換成亞洲人民可接受的語言，而且融入亞洲的文化之中。他指出以色列民族的歷史是「上帝也會以一種救贖的方式與其他民族相關聯」的象徵，同時，他認為從以色列人「出埃及」的獨特體驗中，其他民族也應該辨識出自己的「出埃及」經驗，由此找到自身在「上帝的救贖」中與以色列人並列的位置。這種新的歷史神學思考模式將以色列在救贖歷史扮演的角色「去中心化」，聲稱每個民族的敘事和歷史都具有獨特性，也可與上帝的救贖關聯。他認為長久以來在中心主義的宰制下，基督教神學在以色列─教會史（history of Israel-church）與其他國家和民族之間製造衝突點，唯有這個衝突點形成的障礙被挪開，人類才能不分種族、宗教信仰、國籍而展開一種「愛的交流」。因此，相較於將以色列視為中心的「申命記神學」，宋泉盛更欣賞「第二以賽亞神學」，認為其中蘊含全球視域的神學，他在上帝呼召居魯士為其「牧人」、「膏居魯士統轄列國」的經文中，看到一種具決定意義的神學突破。他對於「選民」的概念也有新的認識，即將「揀選」與「置換」相聯繫，從中悟出可能有多種「揀選」，形成不同「置換」（卓新平2007：227-228；歐力仁2007：51-52；Song 1982: 16-17）。\n\nDisplacement Theology  \n\n\nDisplacement Theology is a historical theological perspective that emphasizes a shift from viewing biblical Israel as the central focus of history to recognizing other nations as integral components of God’s historical construction. This concept was proposed by Shoki Coe (宋泉盛) and builds upon his earlier contextual theology discussions, which emphasized the concept of *incarnation*. In the 1980s, he further argued that the *Word of God* must take on an *Asian flesh* and that God's redemption must hold specific significance for the Asian people. This perspective seeks to explore the concrete meaning of the redemptive history embodied by ancient Israel and the Western Christian Church for the peoples of Asia.  \n\n\nCoe advocated for *narrative theology* as a means to translate the Christian traditions, theological expressions, and complex ideas of the Western world into a language that Asian peoples could understand and integrate into their own cultural contexts. He pointed out that the history of the Israelites serves as a *symbol* indicating that *God also engages with other nations in a redemptive manner*. Furthermore, he suggested that other nations should recognize their own *Exodus experiences* from the Israelites’ unique journey out of Egypt, thereby finding their rightful place alongside Israel in God's redemptive plan.  \n\n\nThis new historical-theological framework *decentralizes* Israel's role in salvation history, asserting that every nation's narrative and history possess unique value and can be connected to God's redemption. Coe argued that, under the dominance of *centrism*, Christian theology has historically created points of conflict between the *history of Israel and the Church* and the histories of other nations and peoples. He believed that only by removing the obstacles formed by these conflicts could humanity engage in an *exchange of love* beyond distinctions of race, religion, and nationality.  \n\n\nThus, in contrast to *Deuteronomic Theology*, which centers on Israel, Coe favored *Second Isaiah Theology*, recognizing within it a theological vision of *global scope*. He saw a decisive theological breakthrough in the biblical passages where God calls Cyrus *His shepherd* and anoints him to *rule over nations*. Coe also introduced a new understanding of the concept of *election*, linking *divine selection* to *displacement*, thereby suggesting the possibility of multiple forms of *election*, leading to various *displacements* (Zhuo Xinping 2007: 227-228; Olli Rin 2007: 51-52; Song 1982: 16-17).\n\n。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\n蔡仁厚（Ren-Hou Tsai, 1930-2019.6.4）\n\n生於江西省雩都梓山鎮，曾就讀廣州大學，新儒家第三代代表人物之一，師承牟宗三。曾任中國文化大學、東海大學哲學系教授，講授「宋明理學」、「陸王哲學」、「王陽明專題」及「中國哲學史」等課程。2004年特聘為東海大學首屆榮譽教授。1970年代，天主教以輔仁大學為中心，開啟從多瑪斯哲學體系以及中國哲學兩條進路去解讀中國文化，其中一位神父在論文中主張非基督宗教只是「自然宗教」，即基督福音的「前驅」，待與基督宗教會面之後，非基督宗教的使命便告完成，而應讓位。此論引發蔡仁厚的批評。1980年他在輔仁大學主辦的「國際哲學會議」發表論文〈儒家精神與道德宗教〉，對基督教入華以來的本色化運動提出六項批評和質疑：1. 人人皆可以成為基督嗎？2. 耶穌是人，還是神？是「神而人」？3. 除了接受耶穌作救主，人還有沒有自我救贖的可能？4. 在宗教會通的立場上，是耶穌獨尊呢？還是與孔子、釋迦……同尊？ 5. 非基督宗教，是否只具有接觸基督福音的那種「合法」的地位，而最後由於完成了預備階段的使命，就必須讓位？還是非基督宗教也同樣有它永恆的獨立的地位？6. 在宗教的會通上，是基督宗教中國化？還是中國基督教化？蔡仁厚指出，外來宗教傳入，必須尊重儒家在中國文化中的主位性，而不可喧賓奪主、偷樑換柱，他認為「儒家不只是諸子百家中之一家，它代表中華民族的民族文化之統」。前四個問題，他是探討基督教和儒、釋、道的根本差異，因此對基督教本色化提出的「會通」表達懷疑。第五個問題則是批評基督教對待其他宗教、文化時的「唯我獨尊」姿態。第六個問題是其這六大質疑的核心，他認為基督教應融入中國文化，而非使中國文化基督教化。他的表態除了從新儒家學者出發，亦站在中國本位的角度，故此主張「中國人」應是眾人的第一性，「宗教徒」乃是第二性。雖然第一性與第二性，有時合一，有時分離，但第一第二的順序，無論如何均不能倒轉。蔡仁厚的評論引起學界廣泛注意，這篇論文陸續刊載於《哲學與文化》、《鵝湖》、《中國文化月刊》等期刊。教界方面，向來重視耶穌對話的天主教會並未直接回應，而是由新教的周聯華出面。宇宙光雜誌社的林治平在1982年邀請周聯華於其雜誌發表〈新儒家與基督教的對話〉一文，逐條回覆蔡仁厚的質疑，惟他並非以護教態度和語言回應蔡仁厚，而是採取對談的方式，之後蔡仁厚不甚認同，於是再予回應。雙方的對話稍後集結成《會通與轉化：基督教與新儒家的對話》一書，1985年由宇宙光雜誌社出版。這場對話雖被認為「各說各話」，未有達致「會通與轉化」，卻是台灣首度新教與新儒家的對話（林金水2003：423-425；梁燕城2014：80-93）。\n\nRen-Hou Tsai (1930 – June 4, 2019)  \n\n\nBorn in Zishan Town, Yudu County, Jiangxi Province, Ren-Hou Tsai was a representative figure of the third generation of New Confucianism and a disciple of Mou Zongsan. He studied at Guangzhou University and later served as a professor in the Department of Philosophy at both Chinese Culture University and Tunghai University, where he taught courses such as *Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming Dynasties*, *Lu-Wang Philosophy*, *Special Topics on Wang Yangming*, and *History of Chinese Philosophy*. In 2004, he was appointed as the first Honorary Professor at Tunghai University.  \n\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Catholic Church, centered around Fu Jen Catholic University, initiated efforts to interpret Chinese culture through two approaches: Thomistic philosophy and Chinese philosophy. In this context, a Catholic priest argued in a paper that non-Christian religions were merely *\"natural religions\"*, serving as *precursors* to the Christian gospel, and that once they encountered Christianity, their mission would be completed and should give way to Christianity. This claim sparked criticism from Tsai.  \n\n\nIn 1980, at the *International Philosophy Conference* hosted by Fu Jen Catholic University, Tsai presented a paper titled *Confucian Spirit and Moral Religion*, in which he raised six critiques and challenges against the indigenization movement of Christianity in China:  \n\n\n1. Can everyone become Christ?  \n\n2. Is Jesus human, divine, or *both divine and human*?  \n\n3. Besides accepting Jesus as the Savior, does humanity have the possibility of self-salvation?  \n\n4. From the perspective of religious syncretism, should Jesus be uniquely revered, or should he be honored alongside Confucius and the Buddha?  \n\n5. Do non-Christian religions merely have a *legitimate* status as preparatory steps toward Christianity, after which they must yield once their mission is fulfilled? Or do non-Christian religions possess their own eternal and independent standing?  \n\n6. In the integration of religions, should Christianity be *Sinicized*, or should Chinese culture be *Christianized*?  \n\n\nTsai argued that the introduction of foreign religions must respect the primacy of Confucianism within Chinese culture and should not *displace the host with the guest* or *replace pillars with beams*. He asserted that *Confucianism is not merely one among the many schools of Chinese thought but rather represents the unifying cultural tradition of the Chinese nation.*  \n\n\nThe first four questions explored fundamental differences between Christianity and Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, expressing skepticism toward the *syncretic approach* of Christian indigenization. The fifth critique targeted Christianity’s *exclusive and dominant stance* toward other religions and cultures. The sixth issue was central to his argument, as he believed Christianity should integrate into Chinese culture rather than transform Chinese culture into Christianity. His stance, while rooted in New Confucianism, also reflected a *Chinese-centered perspective*, emphasizing that *being Chinese* should be *primary*, while *being a religious adherent* should be *secondary*. Although the two identities may sometimes merge or separate, their order, he insisted, must never be reversed.  \n\n\nTsai’s critiques gained widespread attention in academic circles, and his paper was later published in *Philosophy and Culture*, *Goose Lake Monthly*, and *Chinese Culture Monthly*. Within the Christian community, the Catholic Church, which traditionally values interfaith dialogue, did not directly respond. Instead, the Protestant pastor Chou Lien-hua addressed Tsai’s arguments. In 1982, Lin Chih-ping of *Cosmic Light Magazine* invited Chou to publish an article titled *A Dialogue Between New Confucianism and Christianity*, in which he systematically responded to Tsai’s challenges. However, rather than adopting an apologetic stance, Chou engaged in a *dialogical approach*. Tsai, unsatisfied with Chou’s response, issued a further reply.  \n\n\nTheir exchange was later compiled into the book *Integration and Transformation: A Dialogue Between Christianity and New Confucianism*, published by *Cosmic Light Magazine* in 1985. Although the dialogue was often seen as *talking past each other* rather than achieving true *integration and transformation*, it marked the first formal dialogue between Protestant Christianity and New Confucianism in Taiwan (Lin Jinshui 2003: 423-425; Liang Yancheng 2014: 80-93). \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\n中華民國政府（ROC Regime）\n\n1980年代台灣仍在戒嚴期間，宗教團體仍無法擺脫威權體制的掌控。國民黨政權當時仍持續運用已存的情報網，在情治單位的主導下長期嚴密監控、管理各個宗教團體，其原因不外乎擔心宗教團體有被「匪諜」利用的可能性。尤其，對於不甚瞭解、無從掌握的宗教組織，如一貫道、耶和華見證人、新約教會等，動輒扣以「邪教」、「非法組織」的標籤或控為「匪諜」，並予以取締以及運用「行政程序」、「法律審判」進行制裁。當時國民黨政府對宗教團體的收編和管理，可分為兩種型態：對傳統本土宗教，依「監督寺廟條例」作個別管理；對於制度性宗教如佛教、道教、基督教，則按「人民團體組織法」、「民法」集體拉攏。對於難以有效監控、介入的宗教團體，就運用各種政治手段處理，例如有國外聯繫關係的台灣基督長老教會，國民黨當局採取政策上壓制以及監控的方式處理，甚至派人滲入運作（薛化元2022：29-30）。例如透過情治單位成立「導從專案」，專案從1983年長老教會總會舉行30 屆年會前開始，一直持續到解嚴後，至警總改制的1992 年舉行39 屆年會後為止。策略則是透過操弄每年總會年會的副書記選舉，以達成改造長老教會的任務（黃克先2021：43）。「導從專案」同樣用於新約教會，像該會這類難以掌控且邊緣的宗教團體，就指控其為「邪異」、「匪諜」。若干檔案證實，黨國體系在1980年代刻意對前述兩個基督宗教團體分別以滲透和嚴厲打擊的方式進行控管，尤其以戶籍、山地管制區為由驅逐信徒、拆毀房舍對付新約教會實為政府遂行其政策性清除的藉口。且政府對該會信徒更是數次採取肢體暴力手段，尤以1982年和1983年小林河灘強制拆除以及1985年桃園機場事件為甚。\n\n\nRepublic of China (ROC) Regime  \n\n\nDuring the 1980s, Taiwan was still under martial law, and religious groups remained under the control of the authoritarian regime. The Kuomintang (KMT) government continued to employ its existing intelligence network to tightly monitor and manage religious organizations under the direction of security agencies. The primary concern was the potential infiltration of these groups by *“Communist spies”*. In particular, religious organizations that the government did not fully understand or could not control—such as *I-Kuan Tao*, *Jehovah’s Witnesses*, and the *New Testament Church*—were frequently labeled as *“cults”*, *“illegal organizations”*, or even accused of harboring *“Communist spies”*. These groups faced suppression, including bans, administrative penalties, and legal prosecution.  \n\n\nAt the time, the KMT government employed two main strategies for managing religious organizations. Traditional indigenous religions were regulated individually under the *Temple Supervision Ordinance*. Meanwhile, institutionalized religions such as Buddhism, Daoism, and Christianity were collectively incorporated under the *People’s Organization Law* and the *Civil Code*. For religious groups that were difficult to effectively monitor or control, the government resorted to various political measures. For example, in the case of the *Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT)*—which had international connections—the KMT government adopted policies of suppression and surveillance, even infiltrating its operations (Hsueh Hua-yuan 2022: 29-30).  \n\n\nOne such infiltration effort was the *Dao Cong Project*, initiated by security agencies. This project began in 1983, just before the 30th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, and continued until after martial law was lifted, concluding with the 39th General Assembly in 1992 when the *Garrison Command* was reorganized. The strategy involved manipulating the annual election for vice secretary of the General Assembly in order to reshape the Presbyterian Church to align with the government's interests (Huang Kexian 2021: 43).  \n\n\nThe *Dao Cong Project* was also applied to the *New Testament Church*, which, like other marginal and difficult-to-control religious groups, was accused of being *“heretical”* and *“Communist-infiltrated”*. Declassified documents confirm that during the 1980s, the *party-state apparatus* deliberately subjected these two Christian groups to distinct forms of control: infiltration for the Presbyterian Church and severe crackdowns for the New Testament Church. The government used administrative excuses—such as household registration regulations and mountain area control policies—to expel believers and demolish their residences, effectively carrying out a policy-driven purge.  \n\n\nAdditionally, the government repeatedly employed physical violence against the New Testament Church’s followers. Notable incidents include the 1982 and 1983 forced demolitions at Xiaolin Riverside and the 1985 Taoyuan Airport Incident, where state authorities carried out particularly severe crackdowns on the group. \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n政治迫害新約教會信徒\n\n台灣新約教會早期領袖洪以利亞（洪三期）等人在1963年高雄市那瑪夏區（原稱高雄縣甲仙鄉）的雙連堀山坡地墾荒，隔年台灣省政府公布「台灣省公有山坡地推行水土保持辦法」，洪以利亞等人依法申報辦理，並按期向甲仙鄉繳納相關規費，以此取得該公有山坡地的合法承租權。1967年新約教會領袖張路得將這片山坡地取名為「錫安山」，派遣信徒在此開墾、居住，住民在此過著「凡物公用」的生活，自此該地也在宗教意義上成為新約教會的聖山。此時遷入的信徒均按行政程序申請戶籍遷入。1979年洪以利亞更宣稱「神已廢棄中東的耶路撒冷，另揀選了遠東的錫安山」、「錫安山必永遠堅立」。然而國民黨政府對於錫安山的集體生活方式產生疑慮，認為該會「在南部山區建立基地，活動可疑」，又懷疑創辦人江端儀與共產黨有聯繫，指其為「匪」、「左傾份子」，故1970年代至1980年代台灣警備總司令部持續對錫安山住民和新約教會展開專案偵查，1974年成立「清岳專案」強化偵調並進行實際干涉行動。因錫安住民原先設籍的平地行政區甲仙鄉小林村在1973年被變更為屬於山地管制區的三民鄉，而政府卻未將居民的戶籍變更為三民鄉，更認定其為「虛報戶籍」、「空口空戶」，1980年1月高雄縣政府警察局以此為由，在「清岳專案」之下展開大規模驅逐行動，勒令錫安山住民下山，指其違反「戒嚴時期台灣省山地管制辦法」及「平地人民在山地管制區申請戶籍處理要點」之規定。然而洪以利亞和信徒認其乃合法設籍，故訴諸法律。1980年4月1日行政法院判決撤銷警察局「虛報戶籍」之行政處分，但也提及雙連崛現為山地管制區，住民不能因誤認該地為平地行政區而主張居住於此為合法。1980年到1983年信徒談昭興、劉再賜、劉陽得三家人暫居小林河灘，許多國內外新約教會信徒也來此探望、暫居並舉辦聚會，警方先後前往臨檢並拆除其建立的帳棚、草屋，又控告談、劉三家人「竊佔河床地」，1983年談昭興、劉再賜、劉陽得被判處有期徒刑6個月，於同年入監執行，其部分家人在1984年也遭判同樣刑期，另一部分家人獲判緩刑。面對種種迫害，洪以利亞和信徒訴諸法律、街頭抗爭予以反抗，1981年10月10日加州新約教會更在《紐約時報》刊登廣告對國民黨政府進行控訴。1985年情治單位為因應海外新約教會信徒來台「朝聖」，成立「1206專案」，在桃園機場疏處新約教會信徒迎接馬來西亞該會信徒入境。同年12月7日，第二批「南洋朝聖團」未獲准入境而被遣返，部分遭到毆打。前去接機的本地新約教會信徒以及第一批成聖團成員獲報後在機場靜坐，警方對其展開盤查並予以「清場」，部分信徒在身份查核後被施以圍毆毒打，包括以鋼盔、電擊棒、木棍攻擊，其中某些信徒是馬來西亞籍。1986年洪三期帶領信徒重返錫安山，在3月8日、4月6日、5月10日爆發三次衝突，警方再度暴力鎮壓，甚至洪三期亦遭毆打成重傷，住民房舍也被破壞、夷平。由於來自國內外各界的壓力，政府另立「綠野專案」，並於同年10月21日宣布開放雙連崛山地管制區為山地管制遊覽區，信徒始得以回歸錫安山重建家園。1980年代新約教會信徒不時動員大批信徒進行街頭抗爭，並常現身在黨外活動之中。該會與黨外人士雖非立場完全一致，然而因自覺「同受國民黨政權迫害」，在街頭抗爭中時而互相協助（薛化元2022：49-186）。 ",
