He graduated from Changhua First Public School in 1903 and later from the Taiwan Governor-General's National Language School in 1907. From 1918 to 1923, he studied political economy at Waseda University in Japan.  \n\n\nHuang was actively involved in various social movements. During his studies in Japan, he participated in associations of Taiwanese students studying abroad. In 1919, he joined the *Qifa Hui* (啟發會), which was reorganized into the *Xinmin Hui* (新民會) the following year, where he was elected as an officer. In 1921, he served as the general affairs officer of the *Taiwan Youth Association* (臺灣青年會) and the chief administrative officer of *Taiwan Magazine Company* (臺灣雜誌社) in Tokyo, the publisher of *Taiwan Youth* (《台灣青年》), which supported the petition movement for establishing a Taiwanese parliament.  \n\n\nIn 1920, Huang was appointed as the first village head of Xianxi Village in Taichung Prefecture. However, the following year, he and other village leaders from Changhua jointly petitioned Governor-General Kenjiro Den to abolish the *baojia* system, which enforced collective punishment. In addition, he was deeply concerned about Taiwan’s societal and economic issues under colonial rule and expressed opinions on Taiwan’s cultural identity and future. Due to his political activism, his family was implicated, leading his father, Huang Xiuliang, to relocate the entire family to Zhangzhou, Fujian (Deng Hui’en 2012: 17-37; Huang Songxian 2014: 47-54).  \n\n\nHuang’s family originally had a Presbyterian background, but while in China, his younger brother, Huang Chengchao, converted to the True Jesus Church, influencing Huang Chengcong to do the same. In 1926, Huang led a group of eight, including church missionaries and Taiwanese believers from Fujian, to Taiwan for missionary work, successfully establishing three churches. After his conversion, he frequently traveled between Taiwan and China, attending the church’s Nanjing Seminary and assisting with the *Holy Spirit Newspaper* (《聖靈報》). He played a crucial role in the church’s sixth general assembly, which initiated a review of the church’s origins and raised doubts about the founding narrative of Zhang Barnabas (Ye Xianqin & Cai Yanren 2020: 47).  \n\n\nFrom a secular perspective, Huang contributed to social and political reform through participation in movements advocating a moderate cultural resistance against Japanese colonial rule. Masataka Wakabayashi identified Huang as a member of the \"waiting faction\" (待機派) among the local landowning bourgeoisie—those who did not engage in direct resistance against Japan but instead sought to contribute to China’s modernization with their acquired modern knowledge, believing that Taiwan’s liberation would only come once China grew stronger. This view acknowledged the unfavorable political situation in China at the time and urged patience for future changes (Wakabayashi 1987: 41).  \n\n\nFrom a religious perspective, Huang was a foundational missionary of the True Jesus Church in Taiwan, playing a key role in both its organizational and theological development. After cross-strait relations were severed in 1949 due to political tensions, the True Jesus Church in Taiwan assumed a central leadership role, a development that owed much to Huang’s foundational work. He was also instrumental in introducing the True Jesus Church to Japan. To him, the church, founded by Chinese believers, was part of a broader nationalist movement, symbolizing the restoration of the true faith in China. This belief positioned China as the new center of global Christianity, allowing Huang to sustain his spiritual connection to China through religion (Deng Hui’en 2012: 44).\n\n\n井上伊之助（Inosuke Inoue, 1882.9.2-1966.6.20），漢名高天命。醫師、傳道者，台灣早期進行山地傳道者。1900年就讀大成學館夜間部，1905年至1907年就讀東洋宣教會聖書學院，。其父1906年在台灣花蓮山區被太魯閣族原住民殺害，後在一宗教經驗中體悟「最好的報復方式，就是用愛勝過惡」，遂立志到台灣向原住民宣教。惟當時日本政府的「理蕃政策」，正計畫將原住民的宗教信仰「神道化」，因此禁止任何傳道者進入原住民部落傳基督教。井上決定以醫療方式為掩護以利傳教，故此1910年入伊豆戶田寶血堂醫院從事醫學研究和實習，1911年取得醫師證，同年抵台，以山地囑託身份進入新竹加拉排部落，後因病回國。1922年再度來台，被任命為新竹市日本基督教會傳道，並前往山地巡迴傳道，1926年、1931年再次進入原住民部落（井上伊之助2016：42-45、324-328）。井上在台期間不斷呼籲以傳教教化原住民，例如在1923年12月和1924年1月的台北聯合祈禱會上，他不但重申自己乃為原住民而來，且主張日本人既然善於模仿，就應學習他國向外國人和不同種族傳教，並斥責日本今時已有幾處殖民地，日本基督徒卻不曾擬定向其人民傳道的計畫（井上伊之助2016：149-152）。戰後他繼續留在台灣直到1947年始返日，擔任大學講師並進行傳道工作。井上伊之助被稱為「臺灣原住民醫療與宣教之父」，其著作《生蕃記》為原住民研究的第一手資料，尤為再現馘首文化的珍貴風俗誌，並反映對日本理蕃政策的不同意見──反討蕃、不流血、宗教同化、原住民族獨立自主主義，也表明其為基督教社會主義或世界主義傾向的人權運動者（柳書琴2019：152）。1928 年起，井上利用報紙書評或最新媒體電臺，宣揚《生蕃記》相關理念。1929 年4 月，他在法制邊緣的長期遊戰，終因在電臺廣播《生蕃記》一事遭嚴重處分，勒令停職，中止其山地事務（柳書琴2019：155）。伊藤邦幸認為井上伊之助對原住民的再現，跳脫當時的種族主義視角，他廢止「生蕃」一詞，普及「高砂族」之稱，並以相對客觀的立場看待原住民習俗，對於公平分配、男女平等、貞操觀念給予正面評價。他更形容井上伊之助為緩和中國人（包括臺灣人）和日本人之間仇怨的「祭品」（井上伊之助2016：336-337、341）。\n\n\nInosuke Inoue (1882.9.2 – 1966.6.20)  \n\n\nChinese Name: Gao Tianming  \n\n\nInosuke Inoue was a physician, missionary, and one of the early pioneers of Christian missionary work among the indigenous peoples of Taiwan. In 1900, he enrolled in the evening program at Taisei Gakkan (大成學館), and from 1905 to 1907, he studied at the Bible College of the Oriental Missionary Society (東洋宣教會聖書學院).  \n\n\nIn 1906, his father was killed by the Truku indigenous people in the mountainous region of Hualien, Taiwan. However, through a profound religious experience, Inoue came to believe that \"the best form of revenge is to overcome evil with love.\" This realization led him to dedicate his life to missionary work among Taiwan's indigenous communities. However, at the time, the Japanese government's *Indigenous Control Policy* (*理蕃政策*) sought to assimilate indigenous religious beliefs into Shintoism, strictly prohibiting Christian missionaries from entering indigenous settlements.  \n\n\nDetermined to find an alternative approach, Inoue chose to use medical services as a cover for his missionary efforts. In 1910, he joined the Izu Heda Sacred Heart Hospital (伊豆戶田寶血堂醫院) for medical training and research. In 1911, after obtaining his medical license, he arrived in Taiwan and gained access to the indigenous *Kara Pai* settlement in Hsinchu under the guise of a mountain district medical officer. However, he later had to return to Japan due to illness.  \n\n\nIn 1922, Inoue returned to Taiwan and was appointed as a preacher at the Japanese Christian Church in Hsinchu, where he continued his missionary work among indigenous communities. He made additional missionary expeditions into the indigenous territories in 1926 and 1931 (Inoue 2016: 42-45, 324-328). During his time in Taiwan, he actively advocated for the evangelization of indigenous peoples. At the Taipei United Prayer Meetings in December 1923 and January 1924, he reiterated his commitment to indigenous missions. He argued that since the Japanese were skilled at imitation, they should learn from Western missionaries who spread Christianity to foreigners and different ethnic groups. He also criticized the fact that, despite Japan having several colonies, Japanese Christians had never formulated a plan to evangelize the indigenous people in those territories (Inoue 2016: 149-152).  \n\n\nAfter World War II, Inoue remained in Taiwan until 1947, when he returned to Japan. There, he became a university lecturer while continuing his missionary work. Known as the \"Father of Indigenous Medical Missions in Taiwan,\" Inoue wrote *Records of the Raw Savages* (《生蕃記》), a first-hand ethnographic account of Taiwan's indigenous peoples. This work is particularly valuable for its documentation of indigenous headhunting traditions and offers a unique perspective on Japan’s indigenous policies. Unlike mainstream colonial views that promoted violent subjugation, Inoue opposed military suppression of indigenous peoples, advocating instead for non-violent religious assimilation and indigenous self-governance. His writings reveal his leanings toward Christian socialism and cosmopolitan human rights activism (Liu Shuqin 2019: 152).  \n\n\nFrom 1928, Inoue used newspapers, book reviews, and radio broadcasts to promote the ideas in *Records of the Raw Savages*. However, in April 1929, after a prolonged struggle at the legal margins, he was severely penalized for broadcasting its content over the radio. He was forced to resign and was barred from continuing his work in indigenous communities (Liu Shuqin 2019: 155).  \n\n\nAccording to Itō Kuniyuki, Inoue's representation of Taiwan’s indigenous people departed from the racialist perspectives of his time. He abandoned the derogatory term *shengfan* (生蕃, \"raw savages\") in favor of *Takasago-zu* (高砂族, \"Takasago people\"), a more neutral term. He also adopted a relatively objective stance on indigenous customs, offering positive evaluations of their principles of fairness, gender equality, and chastity. Furthermore, Itō characterized Inoue as a \"sacrificial figure\" who sought to ease the tensions and hostility between the Chinese (including Taiwanese) and the Japanese (Inoue 2016: 336-337, 341).\n\n\n中田重治（Juji Nakada, 1870.11.20- 1939.9.24），牧師、商人、新聞工作者、奮興主義者。1888年-1892年在東京英和學校（青山學院前身）神學部就讀，1896年負笈美國芝加哥慕迪聖經學院。在美期間在恩惠衛理公會衛理公會認識牧師高滿（Charles E. Cowman），1901年高滿夫婦與中田在日本東京建立「中央福音傳道館」，而後創設「東京聖經學院」、「遠東宣教會」，1917年創立日本聖潔教會。「遠東宣教會」為一海外宣教團體，宣教範圍遍及東亞、南亞、中美、南美、歐洲。1926年1月中田在東京聖經學院主張台灣傳道時機已然成熟，呼籲前往開拓，同月11日他和安部藤夫從東京到神戶，再搭船到基隆，井上伊之助、龜山、陳芳本、陳溪圳在基隆岸上迎接，之後作全島西部巡迴佈道，聚會多在長老教會禮拜堂舉行。中田此行不但正式開拓聖教會在台灣的工作，也奠定該會日後在台灣發展的根基（陳主培1989）。中田的主要貢獻在於引進揉合聖潔運動和宣道會信仰的日本聖潔教會並設立台灣聖教會，讓台灣的新教市場不再一元，雖稍早有日本聖公會傳入，但以日人信徒為其對象。從此台灣存在持亞米念主義的宗派，無異豐富台灣的神學景觀，增添神學多元性。其創立的「遠東宣教會」也創立了台灣在戰後的第一間神學院「中台神學院」，培養許多本地傳道者。不過，中田和聖教會對長老教會信徒的拉攏，使得長老教會與其發生芥蒂，曾改入聖教會後回到長老教會的傳道者賴仁聲即曾撰文批評該會和中田（賴仁聲 1934：4-5；賴仁聲 1934：2-3）。\n\n\nJuji Nakada (1870.11.20 – 1939.9.24)  \n\n\nJuji Nakada was a pastor, businessman, journalist, and revivalist. From 1888 to 1892, he studied theology at Tokyo Eiwa School (the predecessor of Aoyama Gakuin University). In 1896, he traveled to the United States to study at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. During his time in the U.S., he met Pastor Charles E. Cowman of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1901, Nakada and the Cowmans established the *Central Gospel Mission Hall* in Tokyo, which later led to the founding of *Tokyo Bible Institute* and the *Oriental Missionary Society*. In 1917, Nakada formally established the *Japan Holiness Church*.  \n\n\nThe *Oriental Missionary Society* was an overseas missionary organization with outreach efforts spanning East Asia, South Asia, Central America, South America, and Europe. In January 1926, Nakada, speaking at Tokyo Bible Institute, asserted that Taiwan was now ripe for evangelization and called for missionary efforts there. On January 11 of the same year, he and Abe Fujio traveled from Tokyo to Kobe, then took a ship to Keelung, where they were greeted by Inosuke Inoue, Kameyama, Chen Fangben, and Chen Xizhen. Following their arrival, they conducted a missionary tour along Taiwan’s western coast, holding gatherings primarily in Presbyterian Church chapels. This journey not only marked the official expansion of the Holiness Church’s work in Taiwan but also laid the foundation for its future development (Chen Zhubei, 1989).  \n\n\nNakada’s key contribution was the introduction of the *Japan Holiness Church*, which blended the doctrines of the Holiness Movement and the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and the establishment of the *Taiwan Holiness Church*. This diversified Taiwan’s Protestant landscape, breaking the previous monopoly of a single Protestant denomination. Although the Anglican Church had arrived in Taiwan earlier, it primarily served Japanese congregants. Nakada’s efforts brought an Arminian theological tradition to Taiwan, enriching its theological diversity. Additionally, the *Oriental Missionary Society* later founded Taiwan’s first post-war theological seminary, *China Taiwan Theological Seminary* (*中台神學院*), which played a vital role in training local ministers.  \n\n\nHowever, tensions arose between Nakada’s Holiness Church and the Presbyterian Church, particularly due to efforts to convert Presbyterian believers. This friction led to criticism from those who switched denominations and later returned to the Presbyterian Church. One such figure, Lai Ren-sheng, wrote articles criticizing both Nakada and the Holiness Church for their proselytization efforts (Lai Ren-sheng, 1934: 4-5; 2-3).\n\n\n巴克禮（Thomas Barclay, 1849-1935），巴克禮1921年獲選英國長老教會總會議長。1925年聖經公會決定改譯廈門音舊約白話字聖經，因念及巴克禮稍早翻譯新約之成效，故聘其擔任此項工作。巴克禮先回國休息，1927年春到廈門著手改譯，至1930年12月30日完成改譯工作，交付上海商務印書館印刷。未料1932年上海發生一二八事變，商務印書館被日本轟炸，所印舊約悉數毀於戰火，其工作成果化為烏有。幸而巴克禮之前另抄一份原稿，始避免前功盡棄。巴克禮回台後，仍不時馳函上海打探消息，詢問復工時間。1932年10月巴克禮親自前往上海尋求解決，終得順利進行，於1933年8月4日印刷工作告一段落，12月25日收到印妥之舊約聖經。至此，巴克禮從創世記到啟示錄的白話字聖經改譯工作終告完成，此本聖經在台灣、福建、東南亞閩南語使用者之中流通甚廣，時間亦久。此外，巴克禮亦增補杜嘉德（Carstairs Douglas）編著之《廈門音漢英大辭典》，乃因本辭典付梓經過五十年，其間許多新字和科學用詞未收其中，需要增補。巴克禮為此向傳道局請求派傳道師楊士養至台南協助。1922年5月兩人前往上海進行增補工作並同時校對印刷原稿，1923年《廈門音漢英大辭典增補版》（Supplement to Dictionary Amoy Vernacular）於商務印書館出版（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：136-137；井川直衛1936：81-85）。巴克禮改譯聖經、編修辭典，其意義不僅限於宗教層面，對台灣文學亦有重要貢獻。\n\n\nThomas Barclay (1849–1935)  \n\n\nIn 1921, Thomas Barclay was elected as the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of England. In 1925, the Bible Society decided to retranslate the Old Testament into the *Pe̍h-ōe-jī* (POJ) Romanized Xiamen dialect, considering Barclay’s earlier success in translating the New Testament. He accepted the task but first returned to his home country for a period of rest. In the spring of 1927, he arrived in Xiamen to begin the retranslation work, completing it on December 30, 1930, and submitting it for printing at the Commercial Press in Shanghai.  \n\n\nHowever, in 1932, the January 28 Incident (*Ichihatsu Jiken*) occurred in Shanghai, during which the Commercial Press was bombed by the Japanese military. The entire printed stock of the Old Testament was destroyed in the fire, wiping out years of Barclay’s painstaking work. Fortunately, he had made an additional handwritten copy of the manuscript, preventing the complete loss of his translation.  \n\n\nUpon returning to Taiwan, Barclay persistently corresponded with contacts in Shanghai to inquire about the resumption of printing. In October 1932, he personally traveled to Shanghai to resolve the issue. Printing was finally completed on August 4, 1933, and on December 25 of the same year, he received the newly printed Old Testament. With this, the full *Pe̍h-ōe-jī* Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, was finally completed. This translation was widely circulated among *Hokkien*-speaking communities in Taiwan, Fujian, and Southeast Asia for many years.  \n\n\nIn addition to his biblical translation work, Barclay also contributed to lexicography by expanding *The Chinese-English Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of Amoy*, originally compiled by Carstairs Douglas. Given that half a century had passed since its first publication, numerous new words and scientific terms had emerged that were not included in the original edition. Recognizing the need for an updated version, Barclay requested the missionary George S. White (楊士養) to assist him in Tainan. In May 1922, the two traveled to Shanghai to work on the supplement, simultaneously proofreading the printing manuscript. In 1923, the *Supplement to the Dictionary of Amoy Vernacular* was published by the Commercial Press (Historical Committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, 1965: 136-137; Ikawa Naoe, 1936: 81-85).  \n\n\nBarclay’s contributions extended beyond religious matters. His efforts in translating the Bible and compiling dictionaries significantly influenced Taiwanese literature, language development, and cultural preservation. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\n教廷使節Mario Giardini來台巡視（Apostolic Nuncio Mario Giardini visited Taiwan）。1913年台灣天主教會脫離廈門監牧區，獨立成台灣監牧區，開始與日本四國監牧區西班牙道明會士多有交流，逐漸去中國化。1923年春駐日教廷使節Mario Giardini來台巡視，1月15日抵達基隆，總督府人員予以接待，並與英、美、荷蘭領事等外國駐台官員會面，此外參觀道明會建立的靜修女中。後轉往台中，參觀，再往南部高雄，參觀孤兒院，又到屏東萬金，訪問原住民教友，再回高雄，並贈金五百元重建五塊厝教堂。後北上臺南，再參加台語佈道會；訪畢由台南前往埔羌崙教會，途中順便經過斗南教會，接受台糖公司接待，再到斗六教會，再赴田中教會，從田中到員林教會，再到羅厝莊，最後才取道員林返回臺北，2月1日從基隆返日。Giardini表示對道明會在台灣的傳教工作印象深刻。此次教廷使節巡視由秘書早坂久之助神父陪同，並就此行寫下〈台灣拾掇：伴隨使節記行〉，分為三次在日本天主教刊物《聲》刊登，向日本天主教界反映台灣天主教會實況。本文同時報導台灣風土民情，對此有一些個人詮釋，難免略有殖民者觀點或東方主義的再現。此次巡訪凸顯台灣天主教會的全球在地化，也凸顯其已脫離中國的天主教會教階制度體系而獨立，並與日本教會建立關係（古偉瀛2008：315-347；古偉瀛2008：166）。\n\n\n加拿大聯合教會成立（Establishment of the United Church of Canada）。北部長老教會的母會加拿大長老教會在二十世紀初協議與衛理公會、公理會聯合。1924年9月分裂為贊成聯合的「加拿大聯合教會」（United Church of Canada）和不贊成聯合而主張維持原來見制的「加拿大長老教會」（Presbyterian Church in Canada ）。至1925年6月10日，衛理公會有4797所教會，公理會有166所教會，長老教會有3728所教會，共8691所教會參加「聯合教會」 ，而未加入「聯合教會」的有784間。而三個教派駐在海外之傳教士，其加入「 聯合教會」者有655名，未加入者僅有17名。「加拿大長老教會」於1925年9月在劃定異邦宣道區時，臺灣北部宣道區仍舊歸屬於「長老教會」，並訂於1927年初起「加拿大長老教會」擬承擔臺灣北部宣道區的管理。此事造成「加拿大聯合教會」之北部臺灣的宣教士的進退問題，而後有的離開，有的轉往南部。北部長老教會宣教士因而驟減，失去不少經驗豐富的資深宣教士，為該會發展帶來衝擊（黃武東、徐謙信1962：174-175）。\n\n\n Apostolic Nuncio Mario Giardini Visited Taiwan  \n\n\nIn 1913, the Catholic Church in Taiwan separated from the Xiamen Apostolic Vicariate and became the independent *Taiwan Apostolic Prefecture*. This shift led to increased interactions with Spanish Dominican missionaries from the *Shikoku Apostolic Prefecture* in Japan, gradually reducing its ties with China.  \n\n\nIn the spring of 1923, *Apostolic Nuncio to Japan*, Mario Giardini, visited Taiwan for an inspection tour. He arrived in Keelung on January 15, where he was received by officials from the Governor-General's Office. During his visit, he met with foreign consular representatives from Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. Additionally, he toured *Sacred Heart Girls' School*, which had been established by the Dominican Order.  \n\n\nGiardini then traveled to Taichung and later to Kaohsiung, where he visited an orphanage. From there, he proceeded to Wanchin, Pingtung, where he met with indigenous Catholic believers. Returning to Kaohsiung, he donated 500 yen for the reconstruction of the Wukuaicuo Church. Continuing his journey northward, he stopped in Tainan, where he attended a Taiwanese-language evangelistic meeting. He then traveled to Puqianlun Church, stopping briefly at Dounan Church, where he was received by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. He continued his tour to Douliu Church, Tianzhong Church, Yuanlin Church, and finally Luocuo Village, before making his way back to Taipei. On February 1, he departed from Keelung and returned to Japan.  \n\n\nGiardini expressed deep admiration for the Dominican mission work in Taiwan. He was accompanied by his secretary, Fr. Hisanosuke Hayasaka, who documented the journey in an article titled *\"Taiwan Gatherings: Accompanying the Nuncio's Journey\"*, which was published in three installments in the Japanese Catholic journal *Voice* (《聲》). His writings provided the Japanese Catholic community with insights into the state of the Catholic Church in Taiwan, while also including descriptions of Taiwan's social customs. However, some of his interpretations reflected a colonial perspective and Orientalist discourse.  \n\n\nThis visit highlighted the global-localization (*glocalization*) of the Catholic Church in Taiwan. It also underscored Taiwan’s increasing independence from the Chinese Catholic hierarchy, solidifying its connection with the Japanese Church instead (Gu Wei-ying, 2008: 315-347; 166).  \n\n\n---\n\n\n Establishment of the United Church of Canada  \n\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Presbyterian Church in Canada negotiated a merger with the Methodist Church and the Congregational Church. On September 1924, the church officially split into two factions:  \n\n\n- The United Church of Canada (UCC) – composed of those who supported the union.  \n\n- The Presbyterian Church in Canada (PCC) – comprised of those who opposed the merger and insisted on maintaining Presbyterian doctrine and governance.  \n\n\nBy June 10, 1925, the merger resulted in:  \n\n- 4,797 Methodist congregations,  \n\n- 166 Congregationalist congregations, and  \n\n- 3,728 Presbyterian congregations  \n\njoining the *United Church of Canada*, totaling 8,691 churches.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, 784 Presbyterian churches declined to join.  \n\n\nAmong missionaries stationed overseas, 655 joined the *United Church of Canada*, while only 17 chose to remain with the *Presbyterian Church in Canada*.  \n\n\nIn September 1925, when delineating foreign mission fields, northern Taiwan remained under the jurisdiction of the *Presbyterian Church in Canada*. Beginning in early 1927, the PCC assumed administrative responsibility for the northern Taiwan mission field. This decision created challenges for missionaries in northern Taiwan who had aligned with the *United Church of Canada*, leading some to leave Taiwan while others relocated to southern Taiwan.  \n\n\nAs a result, the number of Presbyterian missionaries in northern Taiwan sharply declined, leading to a loss of many experienced senior missionaries, which significantly impacted the church’s development in the region (Huang Wu-dong & Xu Qianxin, 1962: 174-175). \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n無教會主義。主張相信基督不必然要透過制度和儀式，即不用藉參加教會來實踐信仰。此論創始者為內村鑑三，1891他在擔任代課教師期間，於「教育敕語奉讀式」中未對天皇在敕語旁的簽名行鞠躬禮，而被師生攻擊，因而強烈意識到身為「日本人與基督徒」的張力。在日清和日俄戰爭中，內村開始反思戰爭的正當性，決意「效法基督的不抵抗主義」。在持續思考基督教信仰和日本的關係後，他發現單將教會獨立理解為脫離西方差會的控制，往往可能衍生成狹隘的愛國主義，失去以神為中心獨立思考民族方向的能力，因此最終也需脫離其他日本教會的民族主義和愛國主義思維桎梏，然而，內村及其無教會主義仍帶有國族情感，鼓勵尋找專屬日本的基督教樣貌。他意識到信仰的獨立不是孤立或是孤獨，而是「依賴心中的神」，這是內村與社會保持關係，但又不被統屬的交通方式。他從廣義的角度定義教會，反對從狹義、體制化的角度去理解。意即主張相信基督不必然要透過制度和儀式，不需藉參加教會聚會以實踐信仰。間而言之，無教會主義有三大特徵：單單推崇基督與十字架的教會觀；獨立精神；具國族情感的基督教思想。幾位無教會主義運動者在1920年代曾經在台活動，例如井上伊之助、矢內原忠雄、政池仁、松本巍等人。其中矢內原忠雄對台灣無教會主義思想影響最直接，1929年以王受祿、蔡榮華、黃履鰲、林添水共四人為中心，開始了最初台灣人的無教會聚會，第一次聚會大約有四十人參與。1920年代臺灣人尚有郭芳欽（長老教會信徒）、謝萬安、蔡海清等加入。相對於其他日本來台宣教的教會，無教會主義在台灣的傳道活動一直是以台灣人為主要對象，不同於其他教會所做的宣教事工（陳志忠2005：45-54；廖本恩2024：40-51）。\n\n\n Non-Church Movement (無教會主義)  \n\n\nThe *Non-Church Movement* asserts that belief in Christ does not necessitate adherence to institutionalized rituals or church participation. It was founded by Kanzō Uchimura, who, in 1891, while serving as a substitute teacher, refused to bow to the Emperor’s signature during the *Imperial Rescript on Education Reading Ceremony*. This act led to widespread criticism from both teachers and students, deeply impressing upon him the tension of being both Japanese and Christian.  \n\n\nDuring the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Uchimura began questioning the legitimacy of war and resolved to follow Christ’s principle of non-resistance. As he continued contemplating the relationship between Christianity and Japan, he realized that simply making churches independent from Western mission societies often resulted in narrow nationalism, which could obscure a God-centered perspective on national identity. Therefore, he argued that Japanese Christians should also detach themselves from Japanese nationalism and patriotic ideologies within Japanese churches. However, despite his opposition to nationalism, Uchimura’s *Non-Church Movement* still retained a sense of national identity, encouraging the search for a uniquely Japanese form of Christianity.  \n\n\nUchimura emphasized that faith-based independence was not synonymous with isolation or loneliness; rather, it meant relying on God within oneself. This approach allowed him to engage with society while maintaining autonomy. He broadly defined \"church\", opposing institutionalized and ritualistic interpretations. In essence, he believed that faith in Christ did not require structured institutions or formal church gatherings for worship.  \n\n\nThe *Non-Church Movement* has three main characteristics:  \n\n1. A Christ-centered ecclesiology, focusing solely on Christ and the Cross.  \n\n2. Spiritual independence, rejecting formalized church structures.  \n\n3. A Christian theology infused with national identity, seeking a uniquely Japanese Christian expression.  \n\n\nDuring the 1920s, several prominent figures of the *Non-Church Movement* were active in Taiwan, including Inosuke Inoue, Tadanao Yanaihara, Masaki Hitoshi, and Matsumoto Takashi. Among them, Tadanao Yanaihara had the most direct influence on the development of *Non-Church Christianity* in Taiwan.  \n\n\nIn 1929, four Taiwanese individuals—Wang Shoulu, Cai Ronghua, Huang Lü'ao, and Lin Tianshui—initiated the first Taiwanese-led *Non-Church* gatherings, with approximately 40 participants attending the first meeting. Other notable Taiwanese involved in the movement during the 1920s included Guo Fangqin (a Presbyterian), Xie Wan'an, and Cai Haiqing.  \n\n\nUnlike other Japanese missionary efforts in Taiwan, which primarily focused on Japanese residents or sought institutional church expansion, the *Non-Church Movement* in Taiwan directly targeted Taiwanese believers. This distinction set it apart from other mission-based evangelistic activities (Chen Zhizhong, 2005: 45-54; Liao Ben'en, 2024: 40-51). \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\n日本殖民政權領台底定之後，清末時常出現的反教事件已消聲匿跡，並無組織性的反教運動和反教領袖。1920年代的日治中期許多基督徒已成為社會中堅份子，雖佔少數但深具影響力，不復如清末地方仕紳那般容易煽動民眾予以攻擊，過去地方官府與仕紳連成一氣的情況也不復見。\n\n\nAfter the establishment of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan, anti-Christian incidents, which were frequent during the late Qing period, gradually disappeared, and no organized anti-Christian movements or prominent anti-Christian leaders emerged.  \n\n\nBy the 1920s, during the mid-Japanese colonial period, many Christians had become influential figures in society. Although they remained a minority, their social status and impact had grown significantly. As a result, they were no longer as vulnerable to attacks as they had been during the late Qing era when local gentry could easily incite hostility against them. Additionally, the previous collusion between local officials and gentry, which had facilitated such persecution, was no longer present under Japanese rule. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\n日本殖民政府（Japanese Colonial Regime）。1896年以後，1930年之前，日本殖民政府與基督教之間的關係相對和諧，也允許宗教自由，使基督教得到較清朝時期更好的發展。然而日本政權禁止基督教會以及其他宗教向原住民傳教，在其「理蕃政策」框架下試圖以日本的佛教與神道教的傳播同化原住民，達到有效治理的目標。有學者指出，自 1895年後，日本成為亞洲惟一的殖民國家，殖民經驗的不足，使日本思考與仿傚過去西方荷、英等殖民國家的殖民經驗，宗教上的殖民效用遂受重視。佛教與殖民的合作由淨土宗、曹洞宗開始，在隨軍佈教的情形下，一些佈教使曾於各蕃界內佈教。其後在日本政府支持下，蕃地的佈道工作以真宗本願寺派為主（范純武 1999：255）。日本政府除了藉已然為台灣熟悉的佛教諸派以外為合作對象以外，尤其運用本身的國教神道教宣傳愛國意識並予以征服，因其不獨是宗教且為日本國族與皇室象徵，主張效忠皇室、拜祭皇室祖先。日本政府在山地廣設神社，強迫膜拜，其他宗教宣傳一概被禁止（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：206、365）。在此情況下，原住民傳統宗教受到明顯削弱，各種祭典傳統被禁絕。教會在台灣從二十世紀初即積極籌劃進入山地傳教，但都遭到禁止，傳教工作無法開展。但其中有部分山地原住民在外接觸基督教，成為山地傳教先驅，如姬望、許南免、高添旺、打歪等人（林金水2003：268-269）。\n\n\n Japanese Colonial Regime (日本殖民政府)  \n\n\nBetween 1896 and 1930, the Japanese colonial government maintained a relatively harmonious relationship with Christianity, allowing religious freedom and enabling Christianity to develop more significantly than during the Qing Dynasty.  \n\n\nHowever, Christian missionary efforts among indigenous peoples were strictly prohibited. Under Japan’s *Indigenous Control Policy* (理蕃政策), the government sought to assimilate indigenous communities through the promotion of Buddhism and Shintoism, aiming for more effective governance.  \n\n\nScholars have noted that after 1895, Japan became the only colonial power in Asia. Due to its lack of colonial experience, Japan sought to imitate Western colonial models, particularly those of the Dutch and British, recognizing the strategic role of religion in colonial administration. As a result, Buddhism was actively integrated into colonial governance, with Jōdo-shū (Pure Land Sect) and Sōtō-shū (Sōtō Zen) initially leading missionary efforts, sometimes accompanying the military into indigenous territories. Later, with official government backing, Jōdo Shinshū Honganji-ha (True Pure Land Sect) became the dominant religious group conducting missionary work among indigenous communities (Fan Chunwu, 1999: 255).  \n\n\nIn addition to leveraging Buddhist sects already familiar to the Taiwanese population, the Japanese government aggressively promoted Shintoism as a means of instilling nationalist ideology and loyalty to the imperial family. Since Shinto was not merely a religion but also a symbol of Japanese national identity and the emperor, it became a tool for colonial rule, emphasizing allegiance to the imperial family and ancestor worship.  \n\n\nThe government established Shinto shrines across Taiwan’s mountainous regions and enforced compulsory worship. All other religious activities and proselytization efforts among indigenous peoples were strictly prohibited (Historical Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, 1965: 206, 365). Consequently, traditional indigenous religious practices were severely weakened, and various ceremonial traditions were outlawed.  \n\n\nDespite this restrictive environment, Christian churches in Taiwan had already begun planning missionary work among indigenous communities in the early 20th century. However, their efforts were repeatedly blocked by the Japanese government, preventing large-scale mission work.  \n\n\nNonetheless, some indigenous individuals who encountered Christianity outside their communities became pioneers of indigenous evangelization. Figures such as Ji-wang (姬望), Xu Nanmian (許南免), Gao Tianwang (高添旺), and Da-wai (打歪) later played key roles in introducing Christianity to indigenous groups (Lin Jinshui, 2003: 268-269). \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n中國的非基運動（Anti-Christian Movement）。中國在1920年代發生可分為四個時期的反基督教運動：1922年非上海基督教學生同盟、北京非宗教大同盟發起的抗議；1924-1925年五卅慘案前，以收回教育權為主線；五卅慘案後的反帝運動；1926年秋至1927年春的北伐期間（羅偉虹2014：387）。雖然中國的反教浪潮並未直接影響台灣社會，帶來連動效果，然而1926-1927年以北伐軍策動的反教和排外風潮，衝擊許多宣教士在中國大陸的工作，因而暫時避難到日本和台灣。同時，1927年由於加拿大聯合教會事件風波，不少台灣北部教會宣教士陸續離開，而前述暫時離開中國避難的宣教士，即獲邀在台工作，正好補足加拿大聯合教會事件導致的宣教士短缺問題。例如加拿大聯合教會河南宣道會傅理明（John F. Fleming）與羅明遠（Robert B. McClure）在北台灣服務一年。前者在淡水教英文，後者協助馬偕的醫療工作。然而，這些宣教士只能短期服務，加拿大長老教會因此又陸續差派宣教士來台（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：203）。非基運動雖未直接影響臺灣，但其導致的宣教士逃離，其中部分來台；加上加拿大聯合教會事件導致宣教士離開，兩件國際事件匯合在臺灣，可見其間接影響，是為全球化之結果。\n\n\n Anti-Christian Movement in China (中國的非基運動)  \n\n\nDuring the 1920s, China experienced a series of anti-Christian movements, which can be divided into four phases:  \n\n\n1. 1922 – Protests initiated by the Shanghai Anti-Christian Student Federation and the Beijing Anti-Religious Grand Alliance.  \n\n2. 1924-1925 – A movement centered around the demand to reclaim control over education, leading up to the *May Thirtieth Massacre* (*五卅慘案*).  \n\n3. Post-May Thirtieth Massacre (1925-1926) – Anti-imperialist movements, in which Christian institutions were often targeted as symbols of foreign influence.  \n\n4. Autumn 1926 to Spring 1927 – Anti-Christian and anti-foreign sentiment escalated during the Northern Expedition, with the National Revolutionary Army leading the charge (Luo Weihong, 2014: 387).  \n\n\nAlthough these anti-Christian movements in China did not directly influence Taiwanese society, they had indirect global repercussions, particularly in relation to missionary activities in Taiwan.  \n\n\n Impact on Taiwan  \n\n\nDuring the 1926-1927 anti-Christian and xenophobic wave linked to the Northern Expedition, many missionaries in China faced persecution and were forced to temporarily seek refuge in Japan and Taiwan.  \n\n\nAt the same time, Taiwan’s Presbyterian Church in northern Taiwan was experiencing a missionary shortage due to the United Church of Canada controversy (1927), which led to the departure of several missionaries. This situation created an unexpected opportunity for missionaries fleeing China to temporarily fill the gap left by departing Canadian missionaries.  \n\n\nFor instance, missionaries from the Canadian United Church’s Henan Mission, such as John F. Fleming and Robert B. McClure, were invited to serve in northern Taiwan for a year.  \n\n- Fleming taught English in Tamsui,  \n\n- McClure assisted with Mackay Memorial Hospital's medical work.  \n\n\nHowever, these missionaries could only provide short-term service, prompting the Presbyterian Church in Canada to dispatch additional missionaries to Taiwan later (Historical Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, 1965: 203).  \n\n\nThus, while the Anti-Christian Movement in China did not directly impact Taiwan, it influenced missionary dynamics by forcing some missionaries to relocate to Taiwan. Combined with the missionary exodus caused by the Canadian United Church controversy, these two international events converged in Taiwan, highlighting the globalized nature of religious movements and missionary work.
