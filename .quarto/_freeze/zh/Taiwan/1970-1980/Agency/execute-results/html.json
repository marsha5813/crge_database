In 1936, he enrolled at Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist institution, but later transferred to Florida Bible Institute due to difficulties adapting to the strict fundamentalist environment. In 1940, he attended Wheaton College. Initially from a Presbyterian background, he shifted toward the Baptist tradition during his studies at Florida Bible Institute and was ordained as an evangelist in 1939 by the St. John’s Baptist Association.  \n\n\nIn 1950, Graham founded the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and began conducting evangelistic crusades worldwide, becoming an internationally recognized figure in evangelical circles. During the 1950s, his relatively open and inclusive attitude towards doctrinal interpretation and toward groups often rejected by fundamentalists, such as Catholics and Pentecostals, contributed to the emergence of the \"New Evangelical\" movement. Although still within the conservative faith tradition, the New Evangelicals were comparatively more open and resisted anti-intellectualism. In 1956, Graham established *Christianity Today*, a publication representing the New Evangelical perspective (Martin 2020: 259-260; Dong Jiangyang 2004: 32).  \n\n\nGraham held a staunch anti-communist stance and became involved in Taiwan's political and diplomatic affairs in the 1970s. In 1971, when the Republic of China withdrew from the United Nations, he played a mediatory role between Taiwan and Washington, engaging with figures such as Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon. After the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975, Graham presided over a memorial service for him in Washington, D.C. Later that year, from late October to early November, he visited Taiwan to hold large-scale evangelistic meetings. These events were originally planned to coincide with Chiang Kai-shek’s birthday, incorporating a celebration and tribute delegation to the Presidential Office. However, Chiang passed away in April.  \n\n\nResearcher Zeng Qingbao (2016: 236-239) argues that Taiwan’s pro-Kuomintang (KMT) \"party-state Christians\" leveraged Graham’s influence for both missionary and diplomatic purposes, linking his evangelistic crusades with Chiang Kai-shek’s birthday celebrations. However, since Graham distanced himself from fundamentalism, theologically fundamentalist \"party-state Christians\" gradually grew apart from him.\n\n高俊明（Kao Chun-ming, 1929.6.6-2019.2.14）。台南人，臺灣基督長老教會牧師，為高長之孫。畢業於臺南神學院，曾就讀英國伯明罕雪梨奧克學院（Selly Oak College）。1957年至1970年間擔任玉山神學院院長。1970年-1989年間擔任臺灣基督長老教會總幹事，任內總會發表三個著名宣言：〈台灣基督長老教會對國是的聲明與建議〉（1971年）、〈我們的呼籲〉（1975年）與〈台灣基督長老教會人權宣言〉（1977年）。三次宣言討論期間或發表之後，當時仍在威權時期的國民黨政府對此高度關注，進行錄音、跟監、威脅利誘，甚至介入長老教會會議的議案討論。由於是總幹事又是起草人之一，高俊明遭受政府而來的極大壓力，也曾派人勸說其辭去總幹事之職並離台，由於隨時可能遭受不測，高俊明也因此留下遺書明志。在發表第三個宣言後，其遭政府跟監，但得宣教士花祥、花可玲（Mr. & Mrs. Dan Whallon）夫婦庇護（高俊明2001：262-263；林芳仲2007：249，339）。事實上，由於第三項宣言被政府理解為「台獨」主張，8月19日警總保安處偵防指揮室立即組成「819 專案」指揮部，邀集有關單位，協商處理方式。警政署更稱高俊明為「陰謀份子」，主張誘導其「悔改」，並結合教內「愛國人士」罷黜其地位，如果未能奏效，建議將高俊明和其「黨羽」「放逐國外」，或搜取其不法事證後繩之以法（黃克先2021：30）。1979年發生美麗島事件，政府全力捉捕相關人士，其中重要人物施明德逃亡多日後始被逮捕。在施明德逃亡期間，高俊明與長老林文珍為其提供住所予以庇護，高俊明在1980年4月24日因藏匿罪犯為由被捕，後判處七年有期徒刑，褫奪公權五年，但在1984年8月提前出獄。服刑期間教宗若望保祿二世更曾派駐臺大使葛錫迪（Monsignor Paul Giglio）探監，足見國際對此事之重視（無作者 1982：54-55；高俊明2001：271-275）。高俊明在臺灣局勢驟變且仍是威權時期的1970年代，敢於為人權、民主、國家前途等議題而與威權政府對抗，至今仍被視為臺灣基督長老教會社會公義路線的象徵人物。此外，他非常關注原住民福音及宣教，培養多位原住民傳道者。\n\n\nKao Chun-ming (1929.6.6–2019.2.14) was a native of Tainan and a pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan. He was the grandson of Kao Chang. Kao graduated from Tainan Theological College and Seminary and studied at Selly Oak College in Birmingham, UK. From 1957 to 1970, he served as the president of Yu-Shan Theological College and Seminary. Between 1970 and 1989, he was the General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, during which the General Assembly issued three significant declarations: *A Declaration and Recommendations on the National Affairs of Taiwan* (1971), *Our Appeal* (1975), and *The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan Human Rights Declaration* (1977). \n\n\nDuring the discussions and after the publication of these declarations, the Kuomintang (KMT) government, which was still under authoritarian rule, closely monitored the church, conducting surveillance, recording meetings, and employing threats and inducements, even intervening in church agenda discussions. As the General Secretary and one of the drafters of these declarations, Kao Chun-ming faced immense pressure from the government. He was urged to resign from his position and leave Taiwan. Aware of the constant danger, he even prepared a farewell letter in case of unforeseen circumstances. After the third declaration, Kao was under government surveillance but was sheltered by missionaries Mr. and Mrs. Dan Whallon (Kao 2001: 262-263; Lin 2007: 249, 339).\n\n\nIn fact, because the government interpreted the third declaration as advocating \"Taiwan independence,\" the Security Bureau's Investigation and Prevention Command Office established the \"819 Project\" Command Center on August 19, convening relevant agencies to discuss countermeasures. The National Police Agency labeled Kao Chun-ming a \"conspirator,\" advocating for his \"repentance\" through persuasion and attempting to remove him from office with the help of \"patriotic figures\" within the church. If these efforts failed, they suggested either \"exiling him abroad\" or prosecuting him based on alleged illegal activities (Huang Kexian 2021: 30).\n\n\nIn 1979, the Kaohsiung Incident occurred, and the government launched a full-scale crackdown on those involved. One of the key figures, Shih Ming-teh, evaded capture for several days before being arrested. During his time in hiding, Kao Chun-ming and Elder Lin Wen-chen provided him with shelter. On April 24, 1980, Kao was arrested for harboring a fugitive and later sentenced to seven years in prison with five years of civil rights deprivation. However, he was released early in August 1984. During his imprisonment, Pope John Paul II sent the Vatican's envoy to Taiwan, Monsignor Paul Giglio, to visit Kao, highlighting the international concern over the case (Anonymous 1982: 54-55; Kao 2001: 271-275).\n\n\nIn the 1970s, during Taiwan’s rapidly changing political landscape and ongoing authoritarian rule, Kao Chun-ming courageously opposed the government on issues of human rights, democracy, and national destiny. He remains a symbol of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan’s commitment to social justice. Additionally, he was deeply devoted to indigenous evangelism and missionary work, nurturing many indigenous preachers.\n\n\n王憲治（1941.6.6-1996.3.29）。高雄人，聖公會牧師，1963年在信義會真理堂受洗。1968年畢業於台南神學院，並從1975年-1993年在此任教；1973年獲得紐約聖公會總會神學院神學碩士；1978年取得東南亞神學院神學博士，是東南亞神學研究院第一位神學博士，指導教授為谷寒松。主要著作有《道德經之自然觀及其神學意義》、《台灣鄉土神學論文集》等書，為本土神學重要學者。1977年長老教會發表〈台灣基督長老教會人權宣言〉，在隔年二十五屆總會年會通過該項宣言，聘其以神學顧問身份參與此次會議，面對列席的政府官員，他從民主政治的精神與基督教神學的立場詮釋台灣基督長老教會的「人權宣言」。王憲治不但致力於神學的本土化，也參與民主運動。1978年，美國與中國建交，他於1979年受長老教會總會高層人士之託，與彭明敏、黃彰輝等人出席美國國會為制定台灣關係法所舉行的聽證會。1979年台灣基督長老教會與亞洲教會協會神學委員會舉行的研討會上，他正式提出「鄉土神學」一名，此為一以「鄉土」為核心觀念的處境化神學，主張「鄉」指家鄉或人民，「土」指土地或自然資源。「鄉土」加上「主權」即構成國家，他以此為臺灣國族神學的基礎（莊雅棠1997：21-25）。\n\n\nWang Hsien-chih (1941.6.6–1996.3.29) was a native of Kaohsiung and an Anglican pastor. He was baptized in 1963 at the Evangelical Lutheran Truth Church. In 1968, he graduated from Tainan Theological College and Seminary, where he later taught from 1975 to 1993. In 1973, he obtained a Master of Theology degree from the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church in New York. In 1978, he earned a Doctor of Theology degree from the South East Asia Graduate School of Theology, becoming its first Doctor of Theology, under the guidance of Professor Kosuke Koyama. His major works include *The Concept of Nature in the Dao De Jing and Its Theological Significance* and *Collected Essays on Taiwanese Contextual Theology*, establishing him as a key scholar in indigenous theology.\n\n\nIn 1977, when the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan issued *The Human Rights Declaration of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan*, the declaration was officially adopted at the 25th General Assembly the following year. Wang was invited as a theological advisor to participate in the meeting, where he interpreted the declaration from the perspectives of democratic political principles and Christian theology, addressing the attending government officials.\n\n\nWang Hsien-chih was not only dedicated to the localization of theology but also actively participated in the democratic movement. In 1978, following the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, he was entrusted by senior leaders of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan to attend a U.S. congressional hearing on the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, alongside Peng Ming-min and Huang Chang-hui. \n\n\nAt a 1979 theological seminar jointly organized by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan and the Theological Committee of the Christian Conference of Asia, Wang officially introduced the term \"Contextual Theology of the Homeland\" (*Xiangtu Theology*). This theology centers on the concept of *xiangtu* (\"homeland\"), where *xiang* represents the people and their native place, and *tu* signifies the land and natural resources. He argued that \"homeland\" combined with \"sovereignty\" constitutes a nation, forming the foundation of his theological framework for Taiwan's national identity (Chuang Yat-tang 1997: 21-25).\n\n\n王敬弘（Wang Richard Ching-hung, 1934-1999.2.21）。漢口人，神父，天主教耶穌會修士。台大土木工程系畢業，1958年決定成為神職人員並進入修院，1962年在菲律賓碧瑤神學院就讀。1971年晉鐸後投入天主教神恩復興運動（Catholic Charismatic Renewal Movement），是該運動1967年進入天主教後第一位參與的華人司鐸。然而1970年代臺灣的天主教中國主教團對神恩復興運動一度採取保留態度，王敬弘的工作因也此遭到質疑，尤其他在耕莘文教院為人做「釋放」禱告的舉措被耶穌會領袖禁止。直到張春申按羅馬額我略大學神學教授蘇利文（Francis Sulivan）的看法向主教團說明，神恩復興運動才獲主教團接納，而耶穌會直到1990年代對王敬弘和此一運動的負面印象才得改觀，由於當時王敬弘到輔仁神學院從事研究，與該院耶穌會士共同生活，藉著近距離相處與交談，化解許多會士的疑慮，並且吸引年輕會士吳晶器、吳伯仁、蘇阿元等人投入此運動，他們成為王敬弘過世後，神恩復興運動在臺灣的主要帶領者。王敬弘雖然致力推動神恩復興，強調「在聖神內受洗」、醫治禱告等靈恩向度的聖靈活動，但其信仰並非二分「此世」和「他世」或因強調靈性層面而忽略社會參與。他在開始從事「心靈醫治」（或稱內在醫治）祈禱後，發現接受禱告和輔導的個案承載各種創傷故事，包括：省籍衝突、族群對立、外省人和本省人聯姻不被祝福、勞工待遇偏低等，使他不但單從個人靈性理解這類問題，也嘗試理解背後的社會結構。1980年代後期，他開始關心人權問題，包括為二二八事件受難者家屬發聲，並與各種宗派、體系的基督徒合作，舉辦二二八紀念禮拜、圖文展、座談會。而二二八事件在當時仍是敏感議題，主教團也明令神父、修女不得涉入政治性的活動，他因此遭受從黨國體制和主教團而來的巨大壓力。王敬弘更指出天主教會在臺灣幾乎以外省人為主體，容易認同國民黨政府，對本省人歷史傷痛的理解和體會頗為有限，因此主張以深入瞭解本省人的痛苦為心靈醫治的開端。由於他的部分父執輩親戚有黨國背景，深知其若干沈痾與問題，故此在擔任耕莘文教院院長期間拉高分貝批判國民黨，他因此遭到教友辱罵。此外，其「心靈醫治」服務也被認為某種程度上補足臺灣社會在1980年代之前精神醫療資源不足的缺失，他從1978年開始與華明心理輔導中心專家合作，將祈禱與心理輔導結合，相輔相成，據稱成效頗為理想（林靜宜2018：116-122；耶穌會青年使徒工作小組2004：127-129、284-286）。王敬弘的貢獻除了在臺灣推動神恩復興運動的靈性層面，同時也涵蓋結構性的社會議題並尋求社會公義，可見其信仰關懷的整全性，顛覆了靈恩運動和社會公義無法共存的既定印象。\n\n\nWang Richard Ching-hung (1934–1999.2.21) was born in Hankou and was a Catholic priest and a Jesuit brother. He graduated from the Civil Engineering Department at National Taiwan University and decided to enter the priesthood in 1958, joining the seminary. In 1962, he studied at the Baguio Theological Seminary in the Philippines. After his ordination in 1971, he became actively involved in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal Movement, becoming the first ethnic Chinese priest to participate in the movement since it was introduced to the Catholic Church in 1967.\n\n\nHowever, during the 1970s, the Chinese Regional Bishops’ Conference in Taiwan initially took a cautious stance toward the Charismatic Renewal Movement, which led to skepticism regarding Wang’s work. His practice of conducting \"deliverance\" prayers at the Kuangchi Cultural Center was particularly controversial and was even prohibited by Jesuit leadership. It was only after Zhang Chun-shen explained the movement to the bishops based on the theological perspective of Francis Sullivan, a professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, that the movement gained acceptance within the church. Nevertheless, it was not until the 1990s that the Jesuits’ negative perception of Wang and the movement began to change. During this period, Wang conducted research at Fu Jen Theological College and lived among Jesuits, fostering close interactions that helped ease concerns. His influence also inspired younger Jesuits, including Wu Ching-chi, Wu Po-jen, and Su A-yuan, who later became key leaders of the Charismatic Renewal Movement in Taiwan after Wang’s passing.\n\n\nAlthough Wang was dedicated to promoting the Charismatic Renewal Movement, emphasizing \"baptism in the Holy Spirit\" and healing prayers, his faith did not dichotomize \"this world\" and \"the next\" or prioritize spirituality at the expense of social engagement. When he began practicing \"inner healing\" prayers, he encountered individuals whose personal trauma was deeply intertwined with broader social issues, including provincial conflicts, ethnic tensions, intermarriage discrimination between mainlanders and Taiwanese, and labor exploitation. This led him to explore the structural social factors behind these personal struggles rather than viewing them solely through a spiritual lens.\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Wang became increasingly involved in human rights advocacy, speaking out for the families of victims of the February 28 Incident. He collaborated with Christians from different denominations to organize commemorative worship services, exhibitions, and forums. Given the political sensitivity of the issue at the time, the bishops’ conference explicitly prohibited priests and nuns from engaging in politically related activities, subjecting Wang to immense pressure from both the ruling party and the church hierarchy. Wang also critically observed that Taiwan’s Catholic Church was predominantly composed of mainlanders, making it inclined to sympathize with the Kuomintang government while lacking understanding of the historical suffering of native Taiwanese. He argued that true inner healing must begin with a deep acknowledgment of the pain endured by native Taiwanese.\n\n\nBecause some of his relatives had ties to the Kuomintang regime, Wang was well aware of its systemic problems. As director of the Kuangchi Cultural Center, he took an outspoken stance against the Kuomintang, which led to backlash from certain church members. Additionally, his inner healing ministry was seen as filling a gap in Taiwan’s mental health resources before the 1980s. Since 1978, he had collaborated with experts from the Hua-Ming Psychological Counseling Center, integrating prayer with psychological counseling, reportedly yielding significant results (Lin Jing-yi 2018: 116-122; Jesuit Youth Apostolate Working Group 2004: 127-129, 284-286).\n\n\nWang Richard Ching-hung’s contributions extended beyond the spiritual aspects of the Charismatic Renewal Movement. He also addressed structural social issues and sought social justice, demonstrating the holistic nature of his faith. His work challenged the conventional notion that the Charismatic Movement and social justice were incompatible, proving that spirituality and activism could coexist.\n\n\n林治平（Lin Chi-Ping, 1938.5.22-2024.4.27）。生於湖南長沙，1949年移居臺灣。基督教史學者、《宇宙光》雜誌共同創辦者、中原大學宗教研究所創辦者、中華民國第十二屆十大傑出青年。1966年畢業於政大外交所，論文題目為《律勞卑事件之研究》。1973年，資深基督教文字工作者劉翼凌致函林治平，望其創辦《宇宙光》雜誌，接續1970年停刊的福音雜誌《燈塔》。林治平接下創刊工作，以「福音預工」的文化宣教進路辦理該份刊物，在當時保守的華人教會界可謂新猷，惟與劉翼凌所預設直接宣傳基督教信仰的路線相左，並受到來自包括吳勇在內教會領袖質疑。但林治平認為過於鮮明的基督教符號以及對中國文化的直接抨擊，對傳教並無益處（林治平2023：114-126）。除了福音預工雜誌的創辦，林治平在1970年代開始引領中國基督教史研究的風潮，他在1970 年和 1975年分別出版《基督教與中國近代化論集》和《基督教與中國》兩本重要的代表性著作。林治平在此時中國基督教史研究的主要問題意識在於通過本色化和現代化兩方面的議題來回應反教運動的言論，他也因此從中英外交關係史轉向中國教會史研究。尤其在《基督教與中國近代化論集》，林治平以馬禮遜、丁韙良、孫中山等人為例證，指出基督教與中國現代化的關連，以此為基督教辯護。他認為基督教在當時漢語學界未受到公允的對待，尤以忽略其貢獻，他又指出基督教與中國文化的衝突可能源於某種在深層的文化中早已存在的元素，因此他也強調本色化（陶飛亞、楊衛華2009：169；曾慶豹2011：19-25）。此外，當時他在住處成立文史團契，鼓勵基督徒學生投考文史科系，也邀約大學文史科系學生一起研讀、翻譯西方的中國基督教史書籍以及宣教士回憶錄，當時參與的人員包括後來幾位在相關研究領域執牛耳的學者如李金強、查時傑、魏外揚、陳一萍等人（林治平2023：204）。林治平對中、港、台中國教會史研究扮演重要的催化角色，2007年香港中國教會史研究學界授予「學術成就獎」，表彰其在該領域的貢獻和成就。\n\n\nLin Chi-Ping (1938.5.22–2024.4.27) was born in Changsha, Hunan, and moved to Taiwan in 1949. He was a scholar of Chinese Christian history, a co-founder of *Cosmic Light* magazine, the founder of the Graduate Institute of Religious Studies at Chung Yuan Christian University, and a recipient of the 12th Ten Outstanding Young Persons Award in the Republic of China. \n\n\nLin graduated from the Graduate Institute of Diplomacy at National Chengchi University in 1966, with a thesis titled *A Study of the Ryukyu Incident*. In 1973, senior Christian writer Liu Yi-ling wrote to Lin, urging him to establish *Cosmic Light* magazine as a successor to *Lighthouse*, a Christian publication that had ceased in 1970. Lin took on the task, adopting a \"pre-evangelistic\" cultural missionary approach to the magazine, which was innovative within the conservative Chinese Christian community at the time. However, this direction diverged from Liu Yi-ling’s original intent of directly promoting Christian beliefs and faced skepticism from church leaders, including Wu Yong. Lin argued that overt Christian symbolism and direct criticism of Chinese culture were not beneficial to missionary efforts (Lin Chi-Ping 2023: 114-126).\n\n\nBeyond founding the pre-evangelistic magazine, Lin Chi-Ping led the rise of Chinese Christian historical studies in the 1970s. He published two seminal works, *Essays on Christianity and China’s Modernization* (1970) and *Christianity and China* (1975). His primary academic concern at the time was addressing anti-Christian discourse by engaging with themes of indigenization and modernization, leading him to shift from studying Sino-British diplomatic history to Chinese church history. In *Essays on Christianity and China’s Modernization*, Lin examined figures such as Robert Morrison, William A.P. Martin, and Sun Yat-sen, highlighting Christianity’s role in China’s modernization and using this perspective to defend the faith. He argued that Christianity had not been fairly treated in Chinese-language academia, particularly in acknowledging its contributions. He also suggested that the historical conflict between Christianity and Chinese culture might stem from pre-existing deep cultural elements, thus emphasizing the importance of indigenization (Tao Feiya & Yang Weihua 2009: 169; Tseng Ching-pao 2011: 19-25).\n\n\nAdditionally, Lin established a literary and historical fellowship at his residence, encouraging Christian students to pursue studies in literature and history. He also invited university students from these fields to read and translate Western books on Chinese Christian history and missionary memoirs. Scholars who later became leading figures in the field, such as Li Jin-qiang, Zha Shi-jie, Wei Wai-yang, and Chen Yi-ping, were among those who participated (Lin Chi-Ping 2023: 204).\n\n\nLin played a crucial catalytic role in the study of Chinese church history in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In 2007, he was awarded the \"Academic Achievement Award\" by the Chinese Church History research community in Hong Kong in recognition of his contributions and accomplishments in the field. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\n現代中文譯本的翻譯與出版\n\n聖經公會在1979年出版《現代中文譯本》，強調以現代的文字譯出一本對現代人，尤其是教外人士容易明白的譯本。除了力求文字淺顯易讀，這份譯本的意義還在於天主教和新教的協力與聯合，對於臺灣的教會合一而言意義重大，也可視為梵諦岡第二次大公會議的成果。1970年以前，在臺灣聖經公會推動下，天主教和新教曾即已開會討論合譯共同譯本一事，但在統一專有名詞上出現困難而未能繼續。1971年10月，現代中文譯本的翻譯和校對工作正式展開，由許牧世主持，駱維仁、周聯華、王成章、焦明翻譯，劉緒堂、陳維統、韓承良、房志榮等神父參與校閱。1975新約全書出版，有新教和天主教版之別，差異僅在「上帝」改為「天主」，「聖靈」改為「聖神」，「耶和華」改為「上主」。台北總教區總主教羅光簽署天主教譯本印行，並撰寫序言。1979年完成並發行新舊約全本聖經，但天主教只接受稍早的新約譯本，因次經未被納入。然而基要派人士如王永信強烈抨擊聖經公會與天主教合譯聖經是「新派」信仰的體現，尤其指出該譯本可能將次經（他甚至將稱為典外文獻的次經與「偽經」混稱）列入，影響聖經正典的權威（曾慶豹2016：323）。該譯本的問世，因與天主教合作，而被反合一運動和將天主教視為「異端」的基要派強烈抨擊，反映當時「反共護教」與基要派反「新派」互為表裡的時代氛圍\n\n\n **The Translation and Publication of the Today's Chinese Version (TCV)**  \n\n\nIn **1979**, the **Bible Society** published the *Today's Chinese Version (TCV)*, a translation aimed at **modern readers**, particularly those outside the church, by using contemporary language to make the text more accessible. Beyond its **readability and clarity**, this translation was **significant for fostering cooperation between Catholic and Protestant communities** in Taiwan, marking an important step toward **Christian unity** and reflecting the impact of the **Second Vatican Council**.  \n\n\nBefore **1970**, under the initiative of the **Bible Society in Taiwan**, Catholic and Protestant representatives had met to discuss the possibility of a **joint Chinese translation** of the Bible. However, due to disagreements over the standardization of theological terminology, the effort did not advance.  \n\n\nIn **October 1971**, work on translating and proofreading the *Today's Chinese Version* officially began, led by **Xu Mu-shi**. The **translation team** included **Luo Wei-ren, Chou Lien-hua, Wang Cheng-chang, and Chiao Ming**, while **priests such as Liu Xu-tang, Chen Wei-tong, Han Cheng-liang, and Fang Zhi-rong** participated in the revision process.  \n\n\nIn **1975**, the **New Testament** was published in two versions—**one for Protestants** and **one for Catholics**—with the only differences being terminology:  \n\n- *“God”* (*Shangdi, 上帝*) was changed to *“Lord”* (*Tianzhu, 天主*) in the Catholic version.  \n\n- *“Holy Spirit”* (*Shengling, 聖靈*) was changed to *“Holy God”* (*Shengshen, 聖神*).  \n\n- *“Yahweh”* (*Yehehua, 耶和華*) was changed to *“The Lord”* (*Shangzhu, 上主*).  \n\n\nThe Catholic edition was approved for publication by **Archbishop Luo Guang** of the **Taipei Archdiocese**, who also wrote its preface.  \n\n\nIn **1979**, the **complete Bible**, including both the Old and New Testaments, was finalized and published. However, the **Catholic Church only accepted the earlier New Testament edition**, as the full version **did not include the Deuterocanonical books** (which are part of the Catholic Bible but not the Protestant canon).  \n\n\nDespite its ecumenical spirit, the translation faced **harsh criticism from fundamentalist Protestants**, particularly from figures like **Wang Yong-xin**. They **denounced the collaboration** between the Bible Society and the Catholic Church as a reflection of **\"modernist\" (liberal) theology**. Wang specifically raised concerns that the translation might include the **Deuterocanonical books**—which he **misleadingly conflated** with **Apocryphal** or **non-canonical** texts—thus **undermining the authority of the biblical canon** (Tseng Ching-pao 2016: 323).  \n\n\nThe **controversy surrounding the TCV** reflected the **political-religious climate of the time**, where **anti-communist Christian fundamentalists** saw **opposing Catholic-Protestant unity** as part of their mission to **defend orthodoxy** against \"modernist\" and \"liberal\" influences.\n\n\n「紅皮聖經」的翻譯與出版\n\n《高陳臺灣白話聖經譯本》（俗稱「紅皮聖經」），是唯一一部由天主教與新教共同翻譯的臺語新約聖經，可視為教會響應梵二大公會議推動基督徒合一運動的成果。梵二會議改變了天主教和其他基督徒團體的關係，繼而在不同領域合作，除了翻譯聖經，還有聯合祈禱和合辦社會服務等，臺灣天主教會並未積極響應，在「本地化」的工作方面只以北方中國為主，忽略本地閩南和客家文化。瑪利諾會可以說是在梵二會議後，最早也最積極的與臺灣基督長老教會接觸及合作的天主教團體，這與其慣用臺語傳教不無關係。因此，瑪利諾會不滿足於與新教只是合譯中文聖經，更希望翻譯台語聖經，「紅皮聖經」即是成果。本台語譯本採取「功能對等」（Functional Equivalence）翻譯原則，分成兩階段進行。第一階段是1965至1967年，由瑪利諾會語言學校的教師團隊翻譯四部福音，再邀請基督教聖經公會委託四位長老教會聖經學者王成章、蔡仁理、郭得列、張德香協助校對；第二階段由語言學校高積煥和陳邦鎮兩位老師與長老教會學者駱維仁、鄭連坤、王成章合作，譯出新約聖經的其餘23卷，再修訂四部福音，到1972年9月完成《臺灣白話新約譯本》，俗稱「紅皮聖經」。該譯本的羅馬拼音腔調有別於長老教會慣用的廈門音，採用台中地區通用的偏漳音，乃因衡量漳州腔的覆蓋率在當時佔有優勢，使用人口較多。關於天主教和新教譯名的協調，「紅皮聖經」採用新教的「聖靈」而不用天主教和長老教會均慣用的「聖神」，人名和地名也全部採用新教的譯名，「天主」和「上帝」則各取一字合成「上主」。促成此聯合譯本的戴道輝（Albert V. Fedders）神父表示「在中國歷史上，基督教和天主教第一次耐心而謙卑地，歷時七年來合作完成臺語的新約聖經」（黃懿縈2024：185-198）。\n\n\n The Translation and Publication of the \"Red-Cover Bible\"  \n\n\nThe *Kao-Chen Taiwanese Colloquial Bible* (commonly known as the \"Red-Cover Bible\") is the only Taiwanese Hokkien New Testament jointly translated by the Catholic and Protestant churches. It can be regarded as a result of the Church's response to the Second Vatican Council’s promotion of the Christian ecumenical movement. The Second Vatican Council reshaped the relationship between the Catholic Church and other Christian communities, leading to collaborations in various fields, including not only Bible translation but also joint prayers and social services. However, the Catholic Church in Taiwan did not actively respond to this initiative. Its localization efforts were primarily centered on Northern Chinese, neglecting local Minnan and Hakka cultures.  \n\n\nThe Maryknoll Society was arguably the first and most proactive Catholic group to engage with the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan following the Second Vatican Council, largely due to its tradition of preaching in Taiwanese Hokkien. Dissatisfied with merely co-translating the Chinese Bible with Protestants, the Maryknoll Society sought to translate the Bible into Taiwanese Hokkien, resulting in the \"Red-Cover Bible.\" This translation adopted the principle of *Functional Equivalence* and was carried out in two phases.  \n\n\nThe first phase (1965–1967) involved a team of teachers from the Maryknoll Society’s language school translating the four Gospels. They then invited four Presbyterian biblical scholars—Wang Seng-che, Chhoà Jîn-lí, Kuo Tek-lia̍t, and Tiuⁿ Tek-hiang—commissioned by the Bible Society to assist in proofreading. In the second phase, Maryknoll linguists Philip A. Ho (Koh Kek-hoan) and Bernard W. Kent (Tân Pang-tìn) collaborated with Presbyterian scholars Lo̍h Ûi-jîn, Tēⁿ Liân-khun, and Wang Seng-che to translate the remaining 23 books of the New Testament and revise the four Gospels. By September 1972, the *Taiwanese Colloquial New Testament* was completed, commonly referred to as the \"Red-Cover Bible.\"  \n\n\nThe Romanized phonetic system of this translation differs from the Xiamen pronunciation traditionally used by the Presbyterian Church. Instead, it adopts a variant closer to the Zhangzhou dialect, which was prevalent in the Taichung area. This choice was based on the assessment that Zhangzhou-accented Taiwanese had a wider reach and a larger user base at the time.  \n\n\nRegarding the reconciliation of Catholic and Protestant terminology, the \"Red-Cover Bible\" follows Protestant usage by adopting *Holy Spirit* (聖靈) instead of *Holy Ghost* (聖神), the latter being the term commonly used by both Catholics and the Presbyterian Church. Additionally, personal and place names are entirely rendered in Protestant transliterations. The term for God integrates elements from both traditions: instead of *Tianchu* (天主) used by Catholics or *Shangdi* (上帝) preferred by Protestants, the translators combined one character from each to form *Shangzhu* (上主).  \n\n\nFather Albert V. Fedders, one of the key figures in the joint translation, remarked, \"For the first time in Chinese history, Protestants and Catholics patiently and humbly worked together for seven years to complete the Taiwanese Hokkien New Testament\" (Huang Yi-ying 2024: 185-198).\n\n\n長老教會原生聖靈復興運動\n\n1972年新竹尖石鄉田埔的泰雅族長老教會爆發類似靈恩運動的原生聖靈復興運動，隨後藉巡迴佈道蔓延至新竹、桃園、宜蘭、台中的泰雅族各部落。除了出現預言、醫治等靈恩現象，此次復興運動尤重「悔改」，預言內容也多指向此。根據加拿大長老教會宣教士穆克禮（Clare Elliot McGill）的報告，該運動中女性的主導地位甚為明顯，帶領導告會並組織巡迴佈道。其表現出的宗教現象有與「前基督教」信仰的連續性或綜攝（syncretism），且不時宣稱在「異象」中看見自身乃至他人的罪行，並以近似神諭的方式宣達出來，命人「悔改」，對象有時包含神職人員，因此在某個程度與以男性為主的神職人員存在張力。然而，前述靈恩婦女基本上順從體制而未刻意挑戰。此次復興運動強調的「悔改」其實切合當時泰雅族的處境和危機，例如酗酒、家庭解組、傳統價值瓦解甚至是賣女為娼。與此同時，女性的主導現象達到身分的轉換和性別特質的倒置，延續泰雅族傳統對女性靈性的重視，以及提升女性平信徒在教會的角色。這次復興運動並非由外來的五旬節或靈恩佈道者引入，而是自發的原生復興運動。在其中得到靈性更新的神職人員以及前述靈恩女性的兒女，成為1980年代泰雅族新一波聖靈復興運動領袖。而這新的一波復興，更多受到國際佈道者和全球五旬節或靈恩運動影響，且轉為以男性為主導者（石素英2015：128-133）。\n\n\n Indigenous Holy Spirit Revival Movement in the Presbyterian Church  \n\n\nIn 1972, an indigenous Holy Spirit revival movement, similar to the charismatic movement, emerged in the Tayal (Atayal) Presbyterian Church in Tianpu, Jianshi Township, Hsinchu. Through itinerant preaching, it quickly spread to various Tayal communities in Hsinchu, Taoyuan, Yilan, and Taichung. In addition to charismatic manifestations such as prophecy and healing, this revival particularly emphasized *repentance*, with prophetic messages often focusing on this theme.  \n\n\nAccording to a report by Canadian Presbyterian missionary Clare Elliot McGill, women played a dominant role in the movement, leading prayer meetings and organizing itinerant evangelism. The religious phenomena observed in the movement displayed continuity with or syncretism of *pre-Christian* beliefs. Participants frequently claimed to see visions revealing their own sins or those of others, pronouncing these revelations in a manner akin to divine oracles and commanding repentance. These prophetic rebukes sometimes targeted clergy members, creating tensions with the traditionally male-dominated religious hierarchy. However, the charismatic women involved largely remained compliant with the institutional structure and did not deliberately challenge it.  \n\n\nThe revival's emphasis on *repentance* resonated deeply with the challenges facing the Tayal people at the time, including alcoholism, family disintegration, the erosion of traditional values, and even cases of daughters being sold into prostitution. Simultaneously, women's leadership in the movement facilitated a shift in social identity and gender roles, reinforcing the Tayal tradition of valuing female spirituality and elevating the status of female lay leaders within the church.  \n\n\nUnlike revivals introduced by external Pentecostal or charismatic preachers, this was a self-initiated indigenous revival movement. Clergy members who experienced spiritual renewal through the movement, along with the children of the aforementioned charismatic women, later emerged as leaders of a second wave of Holy Spirit revival among the Tayal in the 1980s. However, this subsequent revival was more influenced by international evangelists and the global Pentecostal or charismatic movement and saw a shift towards male leadership (Shih Su-ying 2015: 128-133).\n\n\n自立與互助運動\n\n臺灣基督長老教會總會繼倍加運動之後，1966年-1971年推動「新世紀宣教運動」，其下細分「三H四自運動」（三H為合作、互助、訓練；四自為自傳、自治、自養、自創）、「信徒訓練五年計畫」、「福音遍傳運動」。並分為五個單元進行：都市宣道年、農村宣道年、工業宣道年、山地宣道年、海外宣道年。1971年-1975年又推動新的宣教事工「忠僕運動」，其運動之目的是反省教會的所扮演之角色，並提出了三個基本精神：教會的時代使命、教會的忠僕形象以及教會的受託精神。1976年總會將上述兩個運動結合，推出為期三年的「自立與互助運動」。自立方面又分為信仰與經濟部份，信仰部分，自推行新世紀宣教運動以來，教會內部受到跨教派的合作之影響，長老教會的傳統與精神逐漸失落，為要回應此一現況，提出了信仰自立的目標，希望能夠加強教會對自身信仰傳統的瞭解；經濟部分，則是回應地方教會相對於中會、總會較富裕之現況，希望教會的經濟結構重整，達到經濟自理的目標。至於互助方面，注重的是事工和服務方面表現，期待加強「一體性」和「共同性」的方面，並促成各堂會間「姊妹教會關係」，朝山地與平地教會合一的目標邁進（認識臺灣基督長老教會編輯小組2010：21-23；賴聖玟 2012：17-24）。\n\n\n The Self-Reliance and Mutual Assistance Movement  \n\n\nFollowing the *Double Growth Movement*, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) launched the *New Century Mission Movement* from 1966 to 1971. This initiative was subdivided into the *Three H and Four Self Movement* (Three H: Cooperation, Mutual Assistance, Training; Four Self: Self-Propagation, Self-Governance, Self-Support, Self-Creation), the *Five-Year Plan for Believers' Training*, and the *Gospel Outreach Movement*. The movement was implemented through five thematic units: *Urban Evangelism Year, Rural Evangelism Year, Industrial Evangelism Year, Mountain Evangelism Year*, and *Overseas Evangelism Year*.  \n\n\nFrom 1971 to 1975, the PCT launched a new mission initiative, the *Faithful Servant Movement*, aimed at reflecting on the role of the church. It proposed three fundamental principles: *the church’s mission in the contemporary era, the image of the church as a faithful servant, and the church’s entrusted responsibility.*  \n\n\nIn 1976, the General Assembly integrated these two previous movements into a three-year initiative known as the *Self-Reliance and Mutual Assistance Movement*.  \n\n\nThe *Self-Reliance* aspect was divided into faith and economic dimensions.  \n\n- **Faith**: Since the implementation of the *New Century Mission Movement*, interdenominational cooperation had influenced the internal structure of the church, leading to a gradual loss of Presbyterian traditions and spirit. In response, the movement set a goal of *faith self-reliance*, aiming to strengthen the church’s understanding of its theological heritage.  \n\n- **Economics**: The movement also addressed the economic disparity between local churches and the wealthier presbyteries and the General Assembly. It sought to restructure the church’s economic system to achieve financial self-sufficiency.  \n\n\nThe *Mutual Assistance* aspect emphasized ministry and service, focusing on strengthening *unity* and *collective identity*. It encouraged the establishment of *sister church relationships* between congregations, with the ultimate goal of unifying mountain and lowland churches (Editorial Committee of *Understanding the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan* 2010: 21-23; Lai Sheng-wen 2012: 17-24).\n\n\n長老教會三大宣言\n\n鑑於1971年10月25日聯合國通過「接納中華人民共和國取代蔣介石在聯合國之席位」的2758決議案，加上美國總統尼克森表示將訪問中國，在此危機氛圍下，臺灣基督長老教會在1971年12月29日提出〈對國是的聲明與建議〉。本宣言草案原來由教會合作協會提出，惟因不得多數宗派、教會接納，各宗派、教會逐一拒絕簽署，紛紛退出，故由長老教會獨自發表。此宣言分為兩部分，一是向國際表明希望在和平、自由、正義中生活，並拒絕共產政權。二是向國內建議革新內政以維護國際地位，並強調在「全國統一之前」於「自由地區（台、澎、金、馬）」進行中央民意代表全面改選。當時因1960年代島內普世教協爭議而旅居海外的幾位長老教會領袖如黃彰輝、黃武東，發起臺灣人自決運動響應。該運動從美國開始，至北美各處成立近 30 個地方總部，還延伸至歐洲、日本、巴西，與臺獨運動人士密切配合。1975年，政府沒收泰雅語與台語羅馬字聖經，同時國際情勢又趨嚴峻，美國總統福特計畫訪問中國。同年長老教會總會「世界關係小組」召開第三次「教會與社會」研討會，就當時國家處境進行研討，與會者提出〈我們的呼籲〉，呼籲政府尊重宗教自由以及發還新譯白話字聖經，並要求准許繼續出版任何語言之聖經。同時，長老教會亦呼籲政府讓教會加入國際性教會組織，以補救近年來臺灣在國際政治地位的危機。全文於9月28日刊登於《臺灣教會公報》，11月18日總會通過以本宣言為該會立場。1977年8月16日，長老教會又發表〈台灣基督長老教會人權宣言〉，倡言「台灣的將來應由台灣一千七百萬住民決定」，並出現「使台灣成為一個新而獨立的國家」的訴求。因1976年美國總統卡特主張以「人權」為外交政策準則，而中國政權又揚言以武力併吞臺灣，長老教會以卡特的「人權」政策切入，提醒美國卡特切勿出賣台灣一千七百萬百姓的人權。這三大宣言引起政府強烈的震撼與不滿，雙方的政教關係日趨緊張（黃克先2021：25；認識臺灣基督長老教會編輯小組2010：25-28）。\n\n\n The Three Major Declarations of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan  \n\n\nIn response to United Nations Resolution 2758, passed on October 25, 1971, which recognized the People's Republic of China as \"the only legitimate representative of China\" and expelled Chiang Kai-shek’s representatives from the UN, coupled with U.S. President Richard Nixon’s announcement of his planned visit to China, the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) issued the *Statement on National Affairs* on December 29, 1971.  \n\n\nThe draft of this statement was initially proposed by the *Churches’ Cooperation Association*. However, as it failed to gain support from other denominations and churches—many of which refused to sign and subsequently withdrew—the PCT ultimately released the statement independently. It consisted of two main parts:  \n\n1. **To the international community**, the PCT expressed its aspiration to live in *peace, freedom, and justice*, while firmly rejecting Communist rule.  \n\n2. **To the domestic government**, the PCT called for *internal reforms* to safeguard Taiwan’s international standing. The statement emphasized the need for *comprehensive re-elections of central representatives* within the “free region” (Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu) *before any potential national reunification.*  \n\n\nAt the time, prominent PCT leaders, such as Huang Chang-hui and Huang Wu-tung, who had been living abroad due to the ecumenical movement controversies of the 1960s, launched the *Taiwanese Self-Determination Movement* in response to the PCT’s declaration. This movement started in the United States and established nearly 30 local chapters across North America, later expanding to Europe, Japan, and Brazil, working closely with Taiwanese independence activists.  \n\n\nIn 1975, the government confiscated the *Atayal and Taiwanese Romanized Bibles* while international pressures intensified, as U.S. President Gerald Ford planned a visit to China. That same year, the PCT’s *World Affairs Committee* convened its third *Church and Society* conference to discuss Taiwan’s political situation. Attendees drafted *Our Appeal*, urging the government to *respect religious freedom*, return the confiscated newly translated Romanized Bibles, and allow the continued publication of Bibles in any language. Additionally, the PCT called on the government to *permit the church to join international Christian organizations* to mitigate Taiwan’s deteriorating international standing. The full text of this appeal was published in the *Taiwan Church News* on September 28, and on November 18, the General Assembly officially adopted it as the church’s position.  \n\n\nOn August 16, 1977, the PCT issued the *Declaration on Human Rights*, asserting that *“the future of Taiwan should be determined by its 17 million residents”* and introducing the demand for *“Taiwan to become a new and independent nation.”* Against the backdrop of U.S. President Jimmy Carter’s *human rights diplomacy* in 1976 and China’s threats of military invasion against Taiwan, the PCT leveraged Carter’s policies to urge the U.S. government not to compromise the human rights of Taiwan’s 17 million people.  \n\n\nThese three major declarations provoked a strong reaction from the Taiwanese government, escalating tensions between the state and the church (Huang Kexian 2021: 25; Editorial Committee of *Understanding the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan* 2010: 25-28). \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n鄉土神學\n\n王憲治在1978年台南神學院校友進修班提出「鄉土神學」的構思，並在1979年9月亞洲基督教協會神學委員會在台北舉行之會議上正式使用「鄉土神學」介紹代表當時臺灣的本土神學。1970年代，一群台灣文化界人士試圖以台灣民族意識作為鄉土文學的論述，「鄉土神學」的構思正反映當時的時代脈絡。王憲治指出，鄉土神學乃是努力從神學上認同和建設臺灣，運用處境神學的方法，嘗試從臺灣的歷史和聖經的特殊處境，找出一條臺灣神學的路。王憲治的鄉土神學建構運用類似宋泉盛移位神學的概念，將跨越黑水溝的臺灣人與過紅海的以色列人均視為上帝呼召的「選民」，為了自由邁向「應許之地」，並參照聖經中以色列人出埃及、建國、亡國、重建的歷史經驗。他認為「鄉」指家鄉或人民，「土」指土地或自然資源，有了「鄉土」再加上「主權」，就構成了國家，而基督教所推崇的「鄉土政治」是以人民為主體，由上帝賦予的「主權」來選擇自己的政府。因此，鄉土神學的主題是人民、土地、權力、上帝。他按1970年代的處境予以詮釋。關於「人民」，他指出在國民黨的威權統治下，臺灣人喪失人性的尊嚴，需要「在基督裡成為新造的人」，並從上帝領受恩典和勇氣以得到解放；關於「土地」，臺灣人有權決定自己土地的前途，並且歡迎所有種族前來建設，他認為土地即是臺灣鄉土神學有別於拉丁美洲解放神學之處；關於「權力」，他認為臺灣人必須從歷史中學習教訓以避免權力的腐化，尤其在外來政權底下，必須從神學上剖析權力的性質、結構、運用；關於「上帝」，鄉土神學批判造神，尤其是將政治人物神聖化或將權力偶像化（王憲治1988：20-22；鄭浚豪2010：369-375；邱凱莉2021：128-131；卓新平2007：224-225）。基本上，鄉土神學緊扣當時臺灣處境，尤其是國家前途和自我認同的問題，雖云「鄉土/土地」，但也涉及政治關懷與意識形態的建立，可視為臺灣處境的解放神學。對於台灣鄉土的認同實際上是源自於台灣基督長老教會與蔣介石政權及其代表的大中華民族主義意識形態的緊張關係，人民的反殖民抗爭運動，以及整個解嚴之後的時代氛圍（邱凱莉2021：131）。\n\n\n Indigenous Theology  \n\n\nIn 1978, Wang Hsien-chih proposed the concept of *Indigenous Theology* (*鄉土神學*) at the alumni seminar of Tainan Theological College and Seminary. The term was formally introduced in September 1979 at a meeting of the *Asian Christian Conference’s Theology Committee* in Taipei to represent Taiwan’s contextual theology at the time.  \n\n\nDuring the 1970s, a group of Taiwanese cultural figures sought to frame *Taiwanese national consciousness* as a key discourse in *nativist literature* (*鄉土文學*). The idea of *Indigenous Theology* reflected this historical context. Wang Hsien-chih argued that Indigenous Theology was an effort to construct a theological framework that both identified with and affirmed Taiwan. Using the *method of contextual theology*, he attempted to develop a uniquely Taiwanese theological path by drawing insights from both Taiwan’s history and the Bible.  \n\n\nWang’s Indigenous Theology incorporated elements similar to *Shoki Coe’s theology of displacement*, likening the experience of *Taiwanese people crossing the Black Water Channel (Taiwan Strait)* to that of *the Israelites crossing the Red Sea*. He depicted both groups as *God’s chosen people*, called to journey toward the *Promised Land* in pursuit of freedom. He also drew parallels between Taiwan’s political situation and the biblical narrative of the Israelites’ *Exodus, nation-building, exile, and restoration*.  \n\n\nWang defined *“乡” (Xiang)* as *homeland or people* and *“土” (Tu)* as *land or natural resources*. He argued that when *homeland and land* are combined with *sovereignty*, a *nation* is formed. Within this framework, Christianity promotes a *“politics of indigenous identity”* (*鄉土政治*), where the people serve as the主体 (*central subjects*), and the *sovereignty granted by God* enables them to choose their own government. Thus, the *core themes* of Indigenous Theology are *people, land, power, and God*, which Wang interpreted according to Taiwan’s political context in the 1970s:  \n\n\n1. **People** (*人民*): Under the Kuomintang’s authoritarian rule, Taiwanese people had lost their dignity and humanity. Wang called for them to become *“new creations in Christ”*, receiving *grace and courage from God* to achieve liberation.  \n\n2. **Land** (*土地*): He argued that Taiwanese people had the *right to determine the future of their land* while welcoming people of all ethnic backgrounds to contribute to its development. He emphasized that *land* was the key distinction between *Taiwanese Indigenous Theology* and *Latin American Liberation Theology*.  \n\n3. **Power** (*權力*): Wang stressed that *Taiwanese people must learn from history to prevent the corruption of power*. In particular, under *foreign rule*, it was crucial to *theologically analyze the nature, structure, and application of power*.  \n\n4. **God** (*上帝*): Indigenous Theology *critiques deification*, especially the *sanctification of political leaders* or the *idolization of power*.  \n\n\nEssentially, Indigenous Theology was deeply rooted in Taiwan’s contemporary reality, especially concerning *the nation’s future and self-identity*. While it emphasized *“homeland” and “land”*, it also addressed *political concerns and ideological formation*, making it a form of *Taiwanese contextual liberation theology*. The affirmation of Taiwan’s *indigenous identity* was fundamentally shaped by the *Presbyterian Church in Taiwan’s* tense relationship with *Chiang Kai-shek’s regime* and its *pan-Chinese nationalist ideology*, the *people’s anti-colonial resistance movement*, and the broader atmosphere of *post-martial law Taiwan* (Chiu Kai-li 2021: 131).\n\n\n處境神學\n\n黃彰輝任職世界基督教聯合會神學教育基金會期間的1973年，與撒普塞茲安（Aharon Sapsezian）共同提出「神學處境化」的概念。黃彰輝主張第三世界的教會首先需要將西方教會及其神學「去處境化」，並在自己的處境中將信仰和神學「再處境化」，以建構第三世界神學的主體性。黃彰輝描述「處境化」的神學方法是持續不斷在經文（the text of the Christian Scripture） 與處境 （context） 中不斷地互動去產生新的聖經詮釋。黃彰輝認為真正的神學反思只能在處境中產生，所有的神學都是處境神學。基督徒必須解讀社會政治處境，辨別時代的徵兆並且根據自身的處境做批判性的神學反思。將基督教神學看做是處境化，就是認真地以看待基督教福音的處境面向，並以批判性的神學思考來作回應。黃彰輝認為，處境化神學可取代傳統的本色化神學，因後者只是關注文化適應和文化融入的問題，對神學發展的社會處境和時代變遷有所忽略。處境化乃深入關注世俗、科技、經濟的發展進程，且為人類公義鬥爭，前述進程正是第三世界國家歷史時刻的重要特徵。處境神學充分回應社會和文化的改變，而非只是針對傳統文化。黃彰輝並指出，錯誤的處境化是盲目適應，遂成一種文化信仰的形式；真實的處境化則是先知性，且來自神的話語與祂所造世界之間的真實會遇，同時透過植根、委身於特定歷史處境，朝向挑戰和改變環境的方向發展（邱凱莉2021：131；卓新平2007：224；Kwan2014：41；Pears 2010：23）。處境神學在1970年代促進了好些以當下臺灣社會與政治處境為考量和題材的神學構思，包括臺灣意識的提升以及對國民黨政權的批判甚至涉及臺灣獨立的層面。此外，處境神學也推動亞洲神學的興起，在當代基督教思想形成影響（卓新平2007：224）。\n\n\n Contextual Theology  \n\n\nIn 1973, during his tenure at the *Theological Education Fund* of the *World Council of Churches*, Huang Chang-hui, together with Aharon Sapsezian, introduced the concept of *contextualization in theology* (*神學處境化*). Huang argued that churches in the Third World must first *decontextualize* Western theology and then *recontextualize* faith and theology within their own socio-historical realities to establish the theological subjectivity of the Third World.  \n\n\nHuang described *contextualization* as a theological method that involves a continuous interaction between *the text of Christian Scripture* and *the socio-political context*, generating new biblical interpretations. He asserted that *authentic theological reflection can only emerge within a specific context*, emphasizing that *all theology is contextual theology*. Christians must critically interpret their social and political environment, discern the *signs of the times*, and engage in theological reflection that directly responds to their lived realities.  \n\n\nUnderstanding Christian theology as *contextualized* means taking seriously the contextual dimensions of the Gospel and responding with *critical theological engagement*. Huang argued that *contextual theology* should replace *indigenization theology* (*本色化神學*), as the latter primarily focuses on *cultural adaptation and assimilation* while neglecting the broader *social, historical, and political dimensions* that shape theological development.  \n\n\nFor Huang, *contextualization* was deeply concerned with the *secular, technological, and economic transformations* of the modern world, as well as the *struggles for justice*—elements that characterized the historical trajectory of many Third World nations. Contextual theology, therefore, actively responds to social and cultural changes rather than merely engaging with *traditional cultural preservation*.  \n\n\nHuang also warned against *false contextualization*, which he defined as *blind adaptation* that turns into *cultural religiosity*. In contrast, *authentic contextualization* is *prophetic*, arising from a genuine encounter between *God’s Word and the realities of the world*. True contextual theology is deeply *rooted in* and *committed to* a specific historical context, striving to *challenge and transform* the existing social and political structures.  \n\n\nIn the 1970s, contextual theology in Taiwan facilitated theological reflections that engaged with *Taiwan’s socio-political realities*, including the rise of *Taiwanese consciousness*, critiques of the *Kuomintang regime*, and discussions of *Taiwanese independence*. Additionally, contextual theology contributed to the development of *Asian theology*, significantly influencing contemporary Christian thought (Chiu Kai-li 2021: 131; Zhuo Xin-ping 2007: 224; Kwan 2014: 41; Pears 2010: 23). \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\n陳鼓應（1935.7.1~）臺灣哲學家，生於福建長汀，1949年前往臺灣。1964年在台大哲學系取得碩士學位，師從殷海光、方東美。畢業後於台大哲學系擔任講師，後昇為副教授。他曾和王曉波在《大學雜誌》上發表時論、鼓吹自由主義，並宣傳保釣運動，鼓勵大學生參與。當時政府基於對學運可能生亂的疑慮予以壓制，尤其擔憂其中的中國國族主義情緒可能與中共串連，遂以「反共」之名對包括陳鼓應在內的多位台大哲學系自由派學者進行整肅，史稱台大哲學系事件。1973年陳鼓應和王曉波以「為匪宣傳」為由遭警總拘留，隨後被解聘。此事在解嚴後獲得平反，1997年陳鼓應得以回台大任教，現為北京大學哲學系人文講席教授（陳世昌2015：107-108）。陳鼓應從1968年到1970年代與多位基督徒學者或神職人員筆戰，包括唐佑之、王敬弘等人。他表示以人本主義和東方人文精神為立論基礎，並按字面理解聖經，抨擊聖經存在諸多不合理性的記載且違背常人的倫理認知，並指出聖經記載的上帝乃專權獨斷且嗜殺。陳鼓應認為上帝是人所造、是按人的需要存在，因此其作為必須合乎人性；人造的上帝應是人類理想化的投射，因而上帝的概念應有仁愛等基本特性，一位「倒行逆施」的上帝應被人所共棄。他又指出上帝的愛，不是無條件的，其先決條件為世人愛神，神才愛世人；即是世人成為其奴僕，才能蒙獲賞賜，可見，基督教的上帝並非「博愛」。其言論引來若干基督徒為文反駁，但陳鼓應後續不予回應，主因是認為回應者悉數為教徒，多從信仰角度駁斥，如此的討論並無益處。且當時他的學術志業在於研究莊子，無暇繼續辯論（大學雜誌編委會1970：1-13、141-142；無作者2011）。基督教並非陳鼓應關注的議題，相關論述也顯示他對基督教學術理解有限，然而其批判激起諸多討論，尤其讓基督徒知識份子思考如何與思想界對話。\n\n\n Chen Gu-ying (July 1, 1935– )  \n\n\nChen Gu-ying is a Taiwanese philosopher born in Changting, Fujian. In 1949, he moved to Taiwan. He obtained a master's degree in philosophy from National Taiwan University (NTU) in 1964, studying under Yin Haiguang and Fang Dongmei. After graduation, he taught at the NTU Department of Philosophy, eventually becoming an associate professor.  \n\n\nChen, along with Wang Xiaobo, contributed political commentaries to *University Magazine*, advocating *liberalism* and promoting the *Protect Diaoyutai Movement*, encouraging university students to participate. At the time, the government, fearing potential unrest from student movements—particularly concerns that *Chinese nationalist sentiments* within the movement could lead to collusion with the Chinese Communist Party—suppressed the movement under the pretext of \"anti-communism.\" This led to a purge of liberal scholars in NTU’s Philosophy Department, an incident known as the *NTU Philosophy Department Affair*. In 1973, Chen and Wang were detained by the *Garrison Command* on charges of \"propaganda for the enemy\" and were subsequently dismissed from their positions. After martial law was lifted, the case was overturned, and in 1997, Chen was reinstated as a professor at NTU. He is currently a *Distinguished Chair Professor in Humanities* at the *Department of Philosophy, Peking University* (Chen Shichang 2015: 107-108).  \n\n\nBetween 1968 and the 1970s, Chen engaged in polemics with several Christian scholars and clergy, including Tang Youzhi and Wang Jinghong. He based his arguments on *humanism* and *Eastern humanistic thought*, interpreting the *Bible literally* and criticizing it for containing *irrational accounts* that contradicted common ethical understandings. He argued that the *God of the Bible* was *autocratic, arbitrary, and bloodthirsty*.  \n\n\nChen asserted that *God is a human creation*, existing to serve human needs. Thus, if God is *a projection of human ideals*, he should embody *benevolence* and other fundamental virtues. Any deity that *acts contrary to moral principles* should be universally rejected. He further argued that *God's love is conditional*, requiring humans to *love God first* in order to be loved in return. In other words, *only by becoming God's servants can people receive rewards*, which contradicts the notion of Christian *universal love*.  \n\n\nHis critiques drew responses from various Christian writers, but Chen refrained from further engagement. He believed that most rebuttals came from a faith-based perspective rather than *scholarly theological discourse*, rendering the debate unproductive. Moreover, at the time, his primary academic focus was on *Zhuangzi studies*, leaving him no time for further theological debate (*University Magazine Editorial Committee* 1970: 1-13, 141-142; Anonymous 2011).  \n\n\nChristianity was never a primary area of Chen’s academic interest, and his critiques demonstrated a *limited scholarly understanding* of Christian theology. Nevertheless, his arguments *provoked significant discussions*, prompting *Christian intellectuals* to reconsider *how to engage with contemporary philosophical and intellectual discourse*. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\n中華民國政府（ROC Regime）\n\n基於1960年代開始的「反共護教」氛圍以及國際上基要派如萬國教聯（International Council of Christian Churches）和反共勢力的結合，將普世教協描繪為「背棄純正信仰」且是親共、容共的團體，有被共產黨滲透之虞，臺灣基督長老教會在1970年遂被政府強迫退出普世教協。當時長老教會在壓力下成立「反共推行委員會」（1973年撤銷），在1970年各中會也舉行一連串的「反共講座」，努力除去政府對其親共的疑慮，以行動宣示反共立場。在退出普世教協後，「反共推行委員會」仍舉辦若干反共聚會並在1972年發函下屬各堂會宣示全力支持、配合第二屆世界基督教護教反共聯合會的活動，甚至1971年發表的〈台灣基督長老教會對國是的聲明與建議〉堅定宣示反共立場，也向國外團體和美國表達不予共產黨妥協的態度，然而這樣的努力並未得到政府承認。長老教會宣教士彌迪理因有份起草該份宣言，在1972年3月5日遭當局驅逐出境。從第一次宣言發表前後，黨國情治系統就對長老教會進行錄音、跟監、威脅利誘，甚至介入長老教會會議的議案討論。1975年原住民長老教會的聖經和聖詩以及台語羅馬字聖經被政府沒收，國民黨當局加深對宗教自由和本土文化的箝制。使得長老教會發表〈我們的呼籲〉予以回應，籲請政府尊重宗教自由以及排除對教會的不信任。1977年鑒於國際局勢，長老教會提出〈人權宣言〉，由於其中論及「新而獨立的國家」，更加激怒國民黨政權，遂沒收當期《臺灣教會公報》，更加強緊盯該會領袖。1970年代臺灣基督長老教會的三大宣言，均挑戰了當時執政當局的權力，長老教會領袖在海外的行動以及與海外人士的來往被情治單位嚴密監控，主要原因是意圖隔絕其與反國民黨政權的海外異議團體或台獨團體的連結。然而長老教會並未屈從，仍持續與海外異議團體互動，在國內則發表聲明回應政府不當舉措，並有技巧地運用跨國宗教的優勢，藉國外勢力向國民黨政權施壓。該會自此逐漸走上與政府對抗的路線（曾慶豹2016：194-217；邱凱莉2021：165-167；黃克先2021：25-26）。\n\n\n The Republic of China (ROC) Regime  \n\n\nAmid the *anti-communist and Christian apologetic* atmosphere of the 1960s, and with the global rise of fundamentalist groups such as the *International Council of Christian Churches* aligning with anti-communist forces, the *World Council of Churches (WCC)* was portrayed as an organization that had *abandoned pure faith*, was *pro-communist or tolerant of communism*, and was suspected of *communist infiltration*. Under government pressure, the *Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT)* was forced to withdraw from the WCC in 1970.  \n\n\nTo dispel government suspicions of *pro-communist affiliations*, the PCT established the *Anti-Communist Implementation Committee* (dissolved in 1973). Throughout 1970, presbyteries across Taiwan organized a series of *anti-communist lectures*, actively demonstrating their opposition to communism. Even after leaving the WCC, the committee continued hosting anti-communist gatherings. In 1972, it issued a directive urging all congregations to *fully support* and *participate in the Second World Christian Anti-Communist Congress*. Furthermore, the *Statement on National Affairs* issued by the PCT in 1971 explicitly reaffirmed an *anti-communist stance*, conveying a *non-compromising attitude* toward communism to international organizations and the U.S. government. However, these efforts failed to gain recognition from the ROC government.  \n\n\nOne of the statement’s co-authors, missionary *Milton D. Meder*, was expelled from Taiwan on March 5, 1972. From the time of the first declaration’s release, the *Kuomintang (KMT) security apparatus* engaged in *surveillance, wiretapping, and intimidation* of the PCT, even interfering in church meetings and discussions. In 1975, the government *confiscated* Bibles and hymnals in *Indigenous languages* as well as *Taiwanese Romanized Bibles*, intensifying its suppression of *religious freedom and local culture*. In response, the PCT issued *Our Appeal*, urging the government to *respect religious freedom* and eliminate its distrust of the church.  \n\n\nBy 1977, amid shifting international dynamics, the PCT released the *Declaration on Human Rights*, which explicitly called for *a “new and independent nation.”* This statement further enraged the KMT regime, which *banned* the corresponding issue of the *Taiwan Church News* and intensified surveillance of PCT leadership.  \n\n\nThe *three major declarations* issued by the PCT in the 1970s directly *challenged the ruling authority*. Overseas activities of PCT leaders, as well as their interactions with foreign individuals and groups, were closely monitored by the KMT’s intelligence agencies. The primary aim was to *isolate the church from connections with overseas dissidents* and *Taiwanese independence movements* that opposed the KMT regime. However, the PCT *refused to submit*. It continued engaging with overseas dissident groups and issued statements within Taiwan to *counter the government’s unjust actions*. Skillfully leveraging its *transnational religious networks*, the PCT *mobilized international pressure against the KMT regime*. From this point forward, the church increasingly took on a confrontational stance against the government (Tseng Ching-pao 2016: 194-217; Chiu Kai-li 2021: 165-167; Huang Kexian 2021: 25-26). \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n沒收羅馬字聖經\n\n1974 年，台中縣和平鄉博愛長老教會（泰雅族）在主日禮拜進行時，警方進入教堂強行帶走泰雅語聖經與聖詩。1975年1月15日政府以違反國語政策為由，沒收臺灣聖經公會新印的1,638冊新譯臺語羅馬字《新約》（紅皮聖經）與重印的655冊《巴克禮白話字聖經》。消息傳至國外，引來外國媒體報導。5月31日教育部公報對此做出解釋，以「違反語言政策」為由辯解，主張「中國政府絕無意干涉或限制宗教自由」、「查禁是因為違反語言政策」。6月2日，聖經公會主任蔡仁理向教育部陳情，請求發還被查扣的《巴克禮白話字聖經》，教育部於6月中旬發還並准予銷售，但新印的「紅皮聖經」按「一律不准發行流布」之原則繼續扣押。同時，美國聯合長老教會的亞洲核心小組(Asian Presbyterian Caucus)主席金牧師(Lester Kim)致函中華民國總統嚴家淦，對當局沒收臺語聖經、剝奪臺灣人民閱讀母語聖經的自由表達不滿。臺灣基督長老教會對政府僅發還聖經但繼續禁止羅馬字聖經的方針表示不滿，在同年發出的宣言〈我們的呼籲〉，第一點「維護憲法所賦予人民宗教信仰之自由」即是針對聖經被沒收一事。宣言中指出「陳情政府為維護憲法上的信仰自由，發還新譯白話字聖經，並准予繼續出版任何語言之聖經」，臺灣長老會總會常置委員會11月18日通過〈我們的呼籲〉一文為總會立場，並請聖經公會和常委積極與政府交涉，發還剩餘被扣押的聖經，但一直未得准許。然而，政府對於天主教表現較為寬容，允許其以「宣教用途」使用新譯的羅馬字「紅皮聖經」，或因天主教信徒較新教少閱讀聖經，且天主教會與政府關係較佳之故（黃懿縈2024：188-205）。\n\n\n Confiscation of the Romanized Bible  \n\n\nIn 1974, during a Sunday service at *Bo’ai Presbyterian Church* in Heping Township, Taichung County (an Atayal congregation), the police entered the church and forcibly seized *Atayal-language Bibles and hymnals*. On January 15, 1975, the government, citing violations of the *Mandarin Language Policy*, confiscated 1,638 newly printed copies of the *Newly Translated Taiwanese Romanized New Testament* (*Red-Cover Bible*) and 655 reprinted copies of the *Barker Colloquial Taiwanese Bible*, published by the *Bible Society in Taiwan*.  \n\n\nNews of the confiscation quickly spread internationally, drawing coverage from foreign media. On May 31, the *Ministry of Education* issued an official statement justifying the confiscation on the grounds of *language policy violations*, insisting that *“the Chinese government has no intention of interfering with or restricting religious freedom”* and that *“the ban was solely due to language policy violations.”*  \n\n\nOn June 2, *Bible Society Director Chhoà Jîn-lí* submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education requesting the return of the confiscated *Barker Colloquial Taiwanese Bible*. In mid-June, the government agreed to return and allow the sale of these copies. However, it upheld its decision to continue *banning the distribution* of the newly printed *Red-Cover Bible*, stating that *“such publications shall not be issued or circulated.”*  \n\n\nMeanwhile, *Rev. Lester Kim*, chairman of the *Asian Presbyterian Caucus* of the *United Presbyterian Church in the USA*, wrote to *ROC President Yen Chia-kan*, expressing *strong dissatisfaction* over the government’s confiscation of the *Taiwanese Romanized Bible*, denouncing it as *a deprivation of the Taiwanese people’s right to read the Bible in their native language.*  \n\n\nThe *Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT)* also condemned the government’s selective return of the *Barker Colloquial Bible* while continuing to ban the Romanized *Red-Cover Bible*. In response, the PCT issued the declaration *Our Appeal* later that year. The *first point* of the declaration—*“Safeguarding the constitutional right to religious freedom”*—was explicitly directed at the government’s confiscation of the Bible. The declaration urged the government *to uphold the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom, return the newly translated Romanized Bible, and permit the continued publication of Bibles in any language.*  \n\n\nOn *November 18*, the *PCT General Assembly’s Standing Committee* formally adopted *Our Appeal* as the church’s official stance. The committee instructed the *Bible Society* and *church leadership* to continue negotiations with the government for the return of the remaining confiscated Bibles. However, the authorities *refused to comply*.  \n\n\nInterestingly, the government showed *greater leniency toward the Catholic Church*, permitting it to use the *newly translated Romanized Red-Cover Bible* for *missionary purposes*. This discrepancy may have been due to the fact that *Catholic believers were less reliant on personal Bible reading compared to Protestants*, and the *Catholic Church maintained a better relationship with the government* (Huang Yi-ying 2024: 188-205).
