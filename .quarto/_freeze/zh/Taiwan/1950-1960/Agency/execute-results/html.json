At the age of 12, she committed herself to sharing God’s love with the Chinese people. In 1948, after earning a bachelor's degree in Far Eastern Studies from the University of Washington, she traveled by ship to Shanghai. However, due to the ongoing Chinese Civil War, she fled with the China Inland Mission to different cities before arriving in Hong Kong in 1949 and later in Taiwan in 1951.  \n\n\nFrom 1951 to 1957, Brougham served in Hualien County, where she established Sunday schools, children’s choirs, and taught at Yu-Shan Theological College and Seminary. She also launched her first gospel radio program. Frequently visiting Atayal indigenous communities, she provided ministry, English lessons, and music education. Among the Atayal people, she was known by her Atayal name *Libeck* (利百佳), meaning \"lily of the valley.\" (Teng Shufen, 2002, pp. 68-74)  \n\n\nBelieving that media was the most effective means of influencing people, in 1960, Brougham co-founded Taiwan’s first Christian radio station—Overseas Radio & Television, Inc. (ORTV, now the ORTV Ministry)—on Zhongshan North Road, Taipei, along with the couples Rev. James and Alice Lee and Rev. George and Eleanor Dunn.  \n\n\nIn the 1960s, recognizing Taiwan’s growing need for English learning and internationalization, Brougham began recording *Studio Classroom* radio broadcasts, which gained widespread popularity due to her innovative classroom-style teaching approach. This later developed into three English-learning magazines of varying proficiency levels: *Let’s Talk in English*, *Studio Classroom*, and *Advanced*, using modern media to support English education. (Teng Shufen, 2002, pp. 68-74)  \n\n\nIn addition to her work in English education, Brougham was also a musician and a brass instrumentalist proficient in the trumpet, French horn, and trombone. In 1963, she produced Taiwan’s first gospel television program, *Heavenly Melody*. The show featured the *Heavenly Melody Choir*, the first full-time Chinese gospel choir, which composed and performed Chinese gospel songs to spread the Christian message. (ORTV Ministry, 2004)  \n\n\nAs an educator, Brougham received numerous awards, including the Order of the Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon from the Office of the President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 2002, recognizing her contributions to English education and Taiwan’s internationalization. She was granted permanent residency in Taiwan in 2002 and officially became a citizen of the Republic of China in June 2023.\n\n\n2. 寇世遠\n\n寇世遠（1920/？/？- 1993/6/29），1920年出生在福建福州，在戰爭期間1938年以特種考試考取福建省「戰時民教訓練所」取得大專學歷，1947年被聘任台灣省訓練團講師，期間曾在二二八事件中被捕入獄三週後無罪釋放。省訓團結束後，先後在台北市立建國中學任教，中國廣播公司擔任編輯組組長。1951年，又因同事涉嫌匪諜牽連入獄126天才獲釋放。（寇世遠， 2006，61-64、132-133）\n\n1952年夫婦同時在教會聚會所受浸歸主，經友人介紹到王連俊先生主持的台北聖經研究班聽課三年，並經其介紹至台北靈糧堂主理查經，並在1957年靈糧堂建堂後成為第一位傳道人服務15年，直至1968年代表信義會出席挪威的國際會議回台後，與靈糧堂董事意見有異而離開。同時在神學院授課，併兼任文化大學基督教研究所所長達十年之久。（林治平 ，1996，180）\n\n1969年寇世遠基於提摩太前書3章15節的異象，提出「基督之家」（The Home of Christ）的構想。同年1月26日，第一個主日崇拜遂借總統府餐廳舉行。同年7月，基督之家正式建立教會體制。（寇世遠， 2006，134-136）1983年寇世遠有見於廣播電視發展，首創於華視播映的「天人之間」電視節目，1993年6月29日在美國舊金山突然猝死，享年74歲。\n\n\nKou Shih-Yuan (寇世遠)  \n\n(1920 – June 29, 1993)  \n\n\nKou Shih-Yuan was born in 1920 in Fuzhou, Fujian. During the war in 1938, he passed a special examination and was admitted to Fujian Province’s \"Wartime Civil Education Training Institute,\" where he obtained a higher education degree. In 1947, he was appointed as a lecturer at the Taiwan Provincial Training Corps. During this time, he was arrested and imprisoned for three weeks during the *February 28 Incident* before being released without charge. After the dissolution of the Provincial Training Corps, he taught at Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School and later worked as the chief editor at China Broadcasting Corporation. In 1951, he was implicated in a case involving a colleague suspected of espionage and was imprisoned for 126 days before being released. (Kou Shih-Yuan, 2006, pp. 61-64, 132-133)  \n\n\nIn 1952, Kou and his wife were baptized at a local church. Through a friend’s recommendation, he attended Bible study classes led by Mr. Wang Lianjun in Taipei for three years. Later, he was introduced to the Taipei Bread of Life Christian Church (靈糧堂), where he led Bible studies. After the church building was completed in 1957, he became the first full-time minister, serving for 15 years. In 1968, he represented the Lutheran Church at an international conference in Norway. However, upon returning to Taiwan, he had disagreements with the church board and subsequently left his position. During this time, he also taught at theological seminaries and served as the director of the Christian Studies Institute at Chinese Culture University for ten years. (Lin Zhiping, 1996, p. 180)  \n\n\nIn 1969, inspired by *1 Timothy 3:15*, Kou proposed the vision for \"The Home of Christ.\" On January 26 of the same year, the first Sunday worship service was held in the Presidential Office dining hall. By July 1969, *The Home of Christ Church* was officially established with a formal church structure. (Kou Shih-Yuan, 2006, pp. 134-136)  \n\n\nRecognizing the growing influence of radio and television, Kou pioneered *Between Heaven and Man* (天人之間), a Christian television program that aired on Chinese Television System (CTS) in 1983. On June 29, 1993, he suddenly passed away in San Francisco, USA, at the age of 74.\n\n\n3. 黃武東\n\n黃武東牧師（Rev. Wudong Huang，1909/？/？-1994/11/13）出生於1909年台南州東石郡義竹庄東後寮（現嘉義縣義竹鄉東光村），原姓李，抱養至黃家因而姓黃。幼時黃家歸信而入牛挑灣教會。因兒時一次嚴重疾病得醫治，父親將其獻給上帝進入台南神學院。1930 年畢業後曾於澎湖、嘉義水上、雲林斗六等教會工作，1937 年在斗六教會封牧。（鄭兒玉，1995，46）\n\n1950 年 1當選第十屆南部大會議長，同年 4 月任南大第一任總幹事。次年3月由黃武東等人發起整併南、北教會的「台灣基督長老教會總會」成立，黃當選為第一屆議長。1953 年自英國留學兩年歸國後在長老教會內協助推動倍加運動，對外代表長老教會參與東海大學籌設。1957 年 2 月當選第一任台灣基督長老教會總幹事。1966 年，自長老教會退休。唯退休後曾任職於國內外教會機構，如1966年 7 月就前往菲律賓短期牧會； 1967 至 1972 年任職於台灣基督教福利會主任。\n\n1972年往美國探兒孫，在次年 3 月就響應台灣基督長老教會的〈國是聲明〉，時身在美國的黃武東與林宗義教授（加拿大）、黃彰輝牧師（英國）、宋泉盛博士（瑞士）等發起「台灣人民自決運動」（Formosans for Self-Determination），後成為黑名單，更遇到國府派員勸誘回台。在美期間受聘於美國紐約市恩惠歸正教會、加州橘郡等教會，直至1980 年 7 月返回紐約，繼續關懷大紐約地區之台灣人教會及社團，並組織、成立「台灣人公共事務協會」（FAPA）。1985 年，《回憶錄》由洛杉磯台灣出版社出版。（鄭兒玉，1995，48-49）\n\n1987 年，與黃彰輝牧師同時接受台南神學院頒發榮譽神學博士學位，也因見母校館舍老舊，史料保存管理不易，促進建立「台灣教會歷史館」於長榮中學。1994 年 9 月自紐約回台，定居彰化。同年 11 月 13 日過世，12 月 10 日下午二點由台灣基督長老教會總會葬。\n\n\nRev. Wudong Huang (黃武東)  \n\n(1909 – November 13, 1994)  \n\n\nRev. Wudong Huang was born in 1909 in Donghouliao, Yizhu Village, Tōseki District, Tainan Prefecture (present-day Dongguang Village, Yizhu Township, Chiayi County, Taiwan). Originally surnamed Li, he was adopted by the Huang family and took their surname. His family converted to Christianity and joined Niutiaowan Church when he was a child. After recovering from a severe illness in his youth, his father dedicated him to God, leading him to study at Tainan Theological Seminary. Upon graduating in 1930, he served at churches in Penghu, Shuishang (Chiayi), and Douliu (Yunlin). In 1937, he was ordained at Douliu Church. (Cheng Er-Yu, 1995, p. 46)  \n\n\nIn January 1950, Huang was elected as the 10th Moderator of the Southern Synod and, in April of the same year, became the first General Secretary of the Southern Synod. In March 1951, Huang and other church leaders initiated the unification of the northern and southern churches, leading to the establishment of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT), where he served as its first Moderator. After studying in the United Kingdom for two years, he returned to Taiwan in 1953 and helped promote the *Multiplication Movement* within the Presbyterian Church while also representing the church in the founding of Tunghai University. In February 1957, he was elected as the first General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, a position he held until his retirement in 1966.  \n\n\nEven after retirement, Huang remained active in church ministries, serving in various domestic and international Christian organizations. In July 1966, he traveled to the Philippines for short-term pastoral work, and from 1967 to 1972, he served as the director of the Taiwan Christian Welfare Organization.  \n\n\nIn 1972, Huang traveled to the United States to visit his children and grandchildren. In March 1973, while in the U.S., he responded to the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan’s \"Statement on Our National Fate\" (國是聲明) by co-founding the Formosans for Self-Determination Movement with Prof. Lin Tsung-Yi (Canada), Rev. Chang-Hui Huang (UK), and Dr. C.T. Song (Switzerland). This advocacy placed him on the Taiwanese government’s blacklist, and he was even approached by government agents attempting to persuade him to return to Taiwan. While in the U.S., he pastored at Grace Reformed Church in New York City and churches in Orange County, California. In July 1980, he returned to New York and continued to support Taiwanese churches and community organizations, leading to the formation of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA).  \n\n\nIn 1985, his *Memoirs* were published by the Taiwan Publishing Company in Los Angeles. (Cheng Er-Yu, 1995, pp. 48-49)  \n\n\nIn 1987, Huang and Rev. Chang-Hui Huang were awarded honorary Doctor of Theology degrees by Tainan Theological Seminary. Concerned about the aging school buildings and the preservation of historical records, he advocated for the establishment of the Taiwan Church History Museum at Chang Jung High School.  \n\n\nIn September 1994, he returned to Taiwan and settled in Changhua. On November 13, 1994, he passed away, and on December 10, a funeral service was held by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan.\n\n\n4.黃彰輝牧師\n\n黃彰輝（Rev. Shoki Coe；1914/8/20-1988/10/28），臺灣彰化人，畢業自英國西敏斯特學院，臺灣基督長老教會牧師，曾任臺南神學院院長、以及總部位於倫敦的普世教會協會世界神學教育基金會總幹事。1972年與黃武東牧師等人於美國發起「臺灣人民自決運動」。（鄭兒玉，1995，48-49）\n\n黃彰輝隨著父親黃俟命牧師的傳教工作成長於台南，1927年進入長老教會中學校就讀，並於1930年前往東京青山學院中學部就讀，後因父病返臺灣。次年他通過嚴格的考試進入臺北高等中學校就讀。1934年赴東京帝國大學研讀哲學。1938年受臺南神學院滿雄才牧師（Rev. W.E. Montgomery)推薦，獲獎學金至劍橋大學的西敏斯特學院研讀神學三年。（鄭仰恩，2001，31）\n\n1941年受英國蘇格蘭長老教會封立牧師，回臺後受聘擔任臺南神學院投入神學教育。1949年受封立為臺灣基督長老教會牧師，並成為第一位臺籍臺南神學院的院長至1965年。期間積極促成長老教會南、北兩大會聯合成立總會，同時在紐約協和神學院院長Dr. Van Dusen等人協助下，促成美國亞洲基督教高等教育聯合董事會（United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia）在臺灣設立東海大學，並和黃武東、陳明清等三人任東海大學第一任董事。（梁碧峯，2015，49-66）\n\n 1953年起黃彰輝受邀參與普世教協（WCC）和世界長老會聯盟（WPA）的會議接觸普世神學思潮。他說服當時長老教會總幹事黃武東牧師進行戰後臺灣教會自己的宣教工作，也間接促成「倍加運動」（P.K.U.）。1965年赴倫敦擔任「世界神學教育基金會」總幹事。1971年擔任普世教協神學教育基金主任，成為台灣任職普世教會機構的第一人。此間他人在海外但仍關切臺灣，1972年3月與黃武東牧師、宋泉盛牧師、林宗義博士等人以共同發起人名義，於美國發起台灣人民自決運動（Formosans for Self-Determination），並聲援長老教會所發表的三個信仰聲明，也因此進入國民黨政府的「黑名單」。1980年他與彭明敏等海外知名人士組織、成立「台灣人公共事務協會」（FAPA），為台灣推動外交工作，拓展國際關係。（鄭兒玉，1995，48-49）1988年10月病逝於英國倫敦。\n\n黃彰輝積極投入神學教育，對普世教會最大的貢獻，是他所率先使用並賦予豐富內涵的「實況化」（contextualization）概念，強調是比「本色化」 （indigenization）更能反映以基督信仰參與在生活實況中的動態性，他也被譽為「獻身普世運動的臺灣本土神學家」。而對台灣本土而言，他的「呣願神學」正好反映了近代台灣人的雙重歷史經驗，一種期待有天可以出頭天的憧憬。（鄭仰恩，2001，33）\n\n\nRev. Shoki Coe (黃彰輝)  \n\n(August 20, 1914 – October 28, 1988)  \n\n\nRev. Shoki Coe, a native of Changhua, Taiwan, was a minister of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) and an influential theologian. He graduated from Westminster College, University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and served as President of Tainan Theological Seminary as well as General Secretary of the Theological Education Fund (TEF) of the World Council of Churches (WCC) in London. In 1972, along with Rev. Wudong Huang and others, he co-founded the Formosans for Self-Determination Movement in the United States. (Cheng Er-Yu, 1995, pp. 48-49)  \n\n\n Early Life and Education  \n\nGrowing up in Tainan, Coe was influenced by his father, Rev. Huang Siming, a Presbyterian minister. In 1927, he entered the Presbyterian Church Middle School and later transferred to Aoyama Gakuin High School in Tokyo in 1930. However, due to his father’s illness, he returned to Taiwan. The following year, he passed a rigorous entrance examination to attend Taipei High School. In 1934, he pursued philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1938, under the recommendation of Rev. W.E. Montgomery from Tainan Theological Seminary, he received a scholarship to study theology at Westminster College, University of Cambridge, where he completed a three-year program. (Cheng Yang-En, 2001, p. 31)  \n\n\n Pastoral and Theological Leadership in Taiwan  \n\nIn 1941, Coe was ordained as a minister by the Church of Scotland and returned to Taiwan to teach at Tainan Theological Seminary, where he committed himself to theological education. In 1949, he was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan and became the first Taiwanese President of Tainan Theological Seminary, serving until 1965. During his tenure, he actively promoted the unification of the Northern and Southern Synods of the Presbyterian Church, leading to the formation of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan.  \n\n\nAt the same time, with support from Dr. Van Dusen, President of Union Theological Seminary in New York, Coe helped establish Tunghai University under the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia. Along with Rev. Wudong Huang and Rev. Chen Mingqing, he served as one of the founding board members of Tunghai University. (Leung Bifeng, 2015, pp. 49-66)  \n\n\n Global Theological Influence and Political Advocacy  \n\nStarting in 1953, Coe participated in conferences of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the World Presbyterian Alliance (WPA), where he was exposed to ecumenical theological thought. He persuaded Rev. Wudong Huang, the then General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, to develop a post-war missionary strategy for the Taiwanese church, which indirectly led to the launch of the Multiplication Movement (P.K.U.).  \n\n\nIn 1965, Coe moved to London to serve as General Secretary of the Theological Education Fund (TEF), becoming the first Taiwanese theologian to hold a position within the WCC. In 1971, he became Director of Theological Education at WCC, marking a significant milestone for Taiwanese representation in international Christian institutions.  \n\n\nWhile abroad, Coe remained deeply concerned about Taiwan’s political situation. In March 1972, he co-founded the Formosans for Self-Determination Movement in the U.S. alongside Rev. Wudong Huang, Rev. C.T. Song, and Dr. Lin Tsung-Yi. The movement called for Taiwanese self-determination and supported the three faith statements issued by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, leading to Coe’s placement on the Kuomintang government’s blacklist.  \n\n\nIn 1980, together with Peng Ming-Min and other prominent overseas Taiwanese figures, Coe co-founded the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), an organization dedicated to Taiwan’s international advocacy and diplomatic efforts. (Cheng Er-Yu, 1995, pp. 48-49)  \n\n\n Theological Contributions and Legacy  \n\nCoe made significant contributions to theological education and ecumenism, particularly through his pioneering use of the term \"contextualization.\" He argued that contextualization better captured the dynamic engagement of Christian faith with contemporary realities, surpassing the earlier concept of \"indigenization.\" His work earned him recognition as a Taiwanese indigenous theologian committed to the ecumenical movement.  \n\n\nMoreover, his \"Mú-guān Theology\" (呣願神學) reflected the dual historical experiences of modern Taiwanese people, embodying both a sense of suffering and hope for a better future. (Cheng Yang-En, 2001, p. 33)  \n\n\nIn 1987, Coe was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Theology from Tainan Theological Seminary, alongside Rev. Wudong Huang. Concerned about the preservation of Taiwanese church history, he also helped establish the Taiwan Church History Museum at Chang Jung High School.  \n\n\nOn October 28, 1988, Coe passed away in London, England, leaving behind a profound legacy in Taiwanese theological education, global ecumenism, and the Taiwanese democracy movement. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\n1. 1954年倍加運動\n\n倍加運動 （Poe-ka Un-tong, PKU）為1954年至1965年間，在台灣由長老教會發起的宣教運動，期待在10年間能達到教會倍增、信徒倍增等目標。\n\n1954年8月於美國伊凡斯頓 （Evanceton ）舉行的普世教協（WCC）第二次會議以「基督是世界的盼望」為題，要求會員教會應對本地的宣教實況深入研究。黃彰輝牧師爭假台南神學院召開研討會，會中由當時南部大會總幹事黃武東牧師以「台灣之宣教」（Ecumenical Studies, “Evangelism in Formosa”） 為題提出研究報告指出，台灣324市鄉鎮中尚有161鄉鎮未設教會，信徒數亦僅佔全人口之0.72%，就九十年來的宣教成效而言，實有深加反省檢討之必要。（徐謙信，1965，342）\n\n適其時高雄中會提出由高雄新興教會蘇天民牧師為首的「全台歸主」的傳道方案，遂匯成倍加運動的動機和先聲。在總會接納後成為以十年為期的宣教運動，欲以倍加運動宣教成果成為來台百年慶典之禮物獻予上帝。\n\n該運動分四個層次著手：\n\n1.信徒：實行獻心、獻金、獻工的三獻運動。\n\n2.會長執會：強化聚會內容；選擇適當地點舉行週間聚會，進而分設教會。\n\n3.中會傳道部：以各種方式宣傳並說明本運動，以喚起眾信徒之關心；籌募經費並做整體規劃及運用；協助教會從事開拓佈道、教育、訓練等實際工作。\n\n4.總會：與國內外友好教會保持聯繫，並爭取精神上及經費上的支援；編製各種文字傳道資料及視聽劇畫器材；收集各種中會事工報告，做成統計資料；提供各中會一切必要支援。（鄭仰恩，1987，13-14）\n\n就成果面而言，在教會數、信徒數、建堂金額、運動奉獻都達到原本預期之倍加目標，對於長老教會的教勢發展及關懷鄉土的決策有深遠的影響。對於台灣基督長老教會（The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, PCT）而言，是極為重要的宣教運動。（黃伯和， 2023，147）\n\n然而，長老教會雖歌頌其宣教成果，仍有學者進行反思，該運動中隱藏著許多宣教上及神學上的問題：以信徒及教會數的倍加為主要目標，而逐漸走向「重且不重質」的危機；宣教型態及對福音的瞭解仍然停留在個人靈魂得救、重來世輕現世、求平安避苦難的層次上，而未考慮該宗派概念中福音的整全性。\n\n同時，該宗派所所提出的倍增數據並未比對同時期台灣的人口成長、經濟成長，或同時參考其他宗派的成長狀況，也在一些宗教社會學文獻中看見了不同的觀點。且在後續研究中發現，倍加運動後台灣就進入了基督宗教發展的一段停滯期，也是後續進行研究的有趣現象。（瞿海源，1982，494、501）\n\n\n The 1954 Multiplication Movement  \n\n\nThe Multiplication Movement (*Poe-ka Un-tong, PKU*) was a missionary initiative launched by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) between 1954 and 1965, aiming to double the number of churches and believers within a decade.  \n\n\nIn August 1954, the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC) was held in Evanston, USA, under the theme “Christ—the Hope of the World.” This assembly urged member churches to conduct in-depth research on their local missionary contexts. In response, Rev. T. C. Huang convened a seminar at Tainan Theological Seminary, where Rev. Huang Wu-Tung, then General Secretary of the Southern Synod, presented a study titled \"Evangelism in Formosa.\" His report highlighted that 161 out of Taiwan’s 324 towns and townships had no churches, and Christians made up only 0.72% of the total population. Reflecting on the ninety years of missionary efforts in Taiwan, he called for serious re-evaluation of the church’s effectiveness (Hsu Chien-Hsin, 1965, p. 342).  \n\n\nAt the same time, the Kaohsiung Presbytery proposed a \"Bring All Taiwan to Christ\" evangelism plan, led by Rev. Su Tian-Min of Kaohsiung Xinxing Church. This proposal laid the groundwork for the Multiplication Movement. Once accepted by the General Assembly, it was officially launched as a ten-year evangelistic campaign, envisioned as a gift to God for the centennial celebration of Christian missions in Taiwan.  \n\n\n Four Key Strategies of the Movement  \n\n1. Believers – Encouraging a “Three Offerings” initiative:  \n\n   - Dedication of heart (spiritual commitment)  \n\n   - Dedication of wealth (financial contributions)  \n\n   - Dedication of service (volunteering for missionary work)  \n\n2. Local Church Leadership – Strengthening church gatherings, selecting appropriate locations for weekday meetings, and gradually establishing new churches.  \n\n3. Presbytery Evangelism Department – Promoting and explaining the movement to mobilize believers, raising funds, conducting overall planning, and assisting churches in outreach, education, and training.  \n\n4. General Assembly – Maintaining connections with domestic and international churches for financial and spiritual support, producing evangelistic literature and audiovisual materials, collecting presbytery reports for statistical analysis, and providing necessary assistance to presbyteries (Cheng Yang-En, 1987, pp. 13-14).  \n\n\n Impact and Criticism  \n\nThe Multiplication Movement successfully met its goals of doubling the number of churches, believers, and financial contributions for church buildings. It had a profound impact on the expansion of the Presbyterian Church and its commitment to Taiwan’s social and religious development (Huang Bo-He, 2023, p. 147).  \n\n\nHowever, while the PCT celebrated the success of the movement, scholars later critiqued its theological and missionary implications:  \n\n- The emphasis on numerical growth led to concerns about quantity over quality.  \n\n- Evangelism remained individualistic, focusing on personal salvation and the afterlife rather than a holistic understanding of the gospel.  \n\n- The reported growth statistics did not account for Taiwan’s population and economic growth trends or compare with other denominations.  \n\n- Following the Multiplication Movement, Taiwan entered a period of stagnation in Christian development, making it a subject of continued sociological and theological study (Chu Hai-Yuan, 1982, pp. 494, 501).  \n\n\n2. 「臺灣基督教國際救濟會」（Taiwan Church World Service）\n\n「臺灣基督教國際救濟會」於 1954 年成立，由美國基督教國際救濟會（Church World Service）與美國世界信義宗救濟會（Lutheran World Relief）共同組成。基督教國際救濟會( CWS ) 成立於第二次世界大戰後的1946 年，有鑑於二戰的破壞是的破壞，由十七個基督教派聚集在一起，「合作完成我們任何人都無法單獨完成的事情」。而世界信義宗救濟會( LWR )成立於 1945 年，旨在為生活在二戰後歐洲的人們收集並向其提供援助。「臺灣基督教國際救濟會」於 1961 年因應社會環境改變更名為「臺灣基督教福利會」。\n\n在台的「臺灣基督教福利會」最初的工作是負責將美國人民所捐獻的物資，轉發給臺灣的民眾。後美國國會通過「480法案」，以剩餘物資濟助貧窮國家，福利會也開始代理救濟貧民的業務，委託台灣各地的基督教會為發放所，（行政院美援運用委員會，1960，2-4）當時合作的基督教會全台共454 間（不包含天主堂，另由天主教福利會負責），其中包括長老教會以及其它教派。這些物資主要是食品與舊衣物，例如奶粉、麵粉、玉米粉、棉被、大衣等等。而此時台灣民眾盛行將麵粉袋加工成內褲使用，至今仍然可以找到印有中美合作的加工內褲，成為一代台灣人的時代記憶。\n\n而四百多間的合作教會中，長老教會是基督教福利會主要的合作對象，不過當時的合作並沒有跟長老教會總會高層洽商，而是由福利會直接與各地方教會接洽。雖讓地方教會增加不少信眾，但此合作模式也在沒有來自高層的規劃與監督，缺少對地方教會的相關訓練下，後續延伸了許多的問題產生許多疏失與弊病，甚至成為政府機關重視的社會問題。（鄭睦群，2017，5-8）\n\n直到美援徹底退出台灣，由台灣的基督教派及所屬單位接手共同管理福利會，並漸漸轉型為社區方案計畫，並隨時代加入食物銀行服務，在長照需求下串聯受訓志工等等創新方案，成為目前台灣基督宗教中重要的跨教派社會福利機構。\n\n\n Taiwan Church World Service (TCWS)  \n\n\nTaiwan Church World Service (TCWS) was established in 1954 as a joint initiative between the Church World Service (CWS) and Lutheran World Relief (LWR).  \n\n\n- Church World Service (CWS) was founded in 1946 in the aftermath of World War II, bringing together seventeen Christian denominations under the motto: \"Cooperating to accomplish what none of us can do alone.\"  \n\n- Lutheran World Relief (LWR) was established in 1945 with the mission of collecting and distributing aid to those affected by post-war Europe.  \n\n\nIn 1961, in response to changing social conditions, Taiwan Church World Service was renamed Taiwan Christian Welfare Service (*台灣基督教福利會*).  \n\n\n Relief Efforts in Taiwan  \n\nInitially, the Taiwan Christian Welfare Service focused on distributing aid donated by the American public to Taiwanese communities. With the passage of Public Law 480 by the U.S. Congress, which facilitated surplus commodity donations to impoverished nations, the organization expanded its operations to include poverty relief programs. Aid distribution was coordinated through local churches, under the oversight of the Council for U.S. Aid Utilization under the Executive Yuan (1960, pp. 2-4).  \n\n\nAt its peak, 454 churches across Taiwan (excluding Catholic parishes, which were managed separately by the Catholic Welfare Service) participated in these relief efforts. This included the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) as well as other Protestant denominations. The primary relief supplies consisted of food and second-hand clothing, such as milk powder, flour, cornmeal, blankets, and coats. Notably, flour sacks were repurposed by many Taiwanese people to make underwear, with some still found today bearing \"Sino-American Cooperation\" labels—symbolizing a shared historical memory for an entire generation in Taiwan.  \n\n\n Challenges in Collaboration with the Presbyterian Church  \n\nAlthough the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) was the primary partner in distributing aid, collaboration occurred directly with local churches rather than through the PCT General Assembly. This bypassed central oversight, leading to uncoordinated expansion and a lack of proper training for local churches in managing aid distribution. Consequently, various administrative issues and mismanagement arose, eventually drawing the attention of government agencies as a social concern (Cheng Mu-Chun, 2017, pp. 5-8).  \n\n\n Transition and Modernization  \n\nFollowing the withdrawal of U.S. aid, Taiwanese Christian denominations took over the management of the welfare organization. Over time, the organization transitioned from direct aid distribution to community-based programs, incorporating modern food bank services and volunteer training programs to address long-term care needs. Today, Taiwan Christian Welfare Service stands as a key interdenominational social welfare institution within Taiwan’s Christian community, continuously adapting to contemporary social challenges.  \n\n\n3. 美援\n\nU.S. Aid，即美國援助，廣義說法是指美國在二戰後一系列大規模、有計畫的國際援助行動。如美國國務卿馬歇爾(George Catlet Marshall)於 1947年提出「歐洲復興計畫」 (European Recovery Program)，欲以220億美元進行國際援助振興二戰後的歐洲。而到了1948年美國國會通過「援外法案」(Foreign Assistance Act)，其中將中華民國納入美援的受惠國。（王曾才，1976，329）\n\n因此，台灣處境下狹義說法是指時任中華民國總統兼中國國民黨總裁蔣中正領導的中華民國政府遷移臺灣後，臺灣島成為亞太地區防堵共產勢力擴張的第一島鏈，與西歐、日本、韓國等形成國際中的反共陣營，而獲得美國的援助。1951年起，美國國會通過《共同安全法案》（Mutual Security Acts）對在臺的中華民國提供的經濟援助。（戴天朝，2002，351-352）\n\n1951年美援初期占臺灣國民生產毛額的13%，到了1957年，美援由原本的贈與性質改為贈與及貸款並行， 1962年後，美國認為臺灣的經濟開發程度已高，展現累積外匯的能力，不再適用防衛資助，美援方式大部分改為無息貸款取代，經援比例降至2%，1959年，美國對中華民國的金援逐漸減少。美國國務院便於1965年6月終止對臺灣的經濟援助。直到2004年1月台灣政府已將積欠美方的貸款全部清償。（陶涵， 2010，608-610）\n\n1951到1965年間，臺灣總共接受14.82億美元的援款，成為當時臺灣發展的重要資源之一。占美援資金比例最高的，就是對臺灣基礎建設的投資，包括發電廠、水庫、西螺大橋、中橫公路、麥帥公路都在美援的協助下陸續完成。甚至也曾擴及都市規劃，如現在臺北人所熟悉的「民生社區」。（互助營造股份有限公司，2012， 136）\n\n美國對臺灣除留下鐵路、公路、發電廠等實體資產外，對臺灣基層人民最「有感」的影響是臺灣人的生活型態與文化。根據美國第480號公共法案，中華民國政府可以透過美援管道以新臺幣購買美國剩餘的農產品，因此小麥、玉米、黄豆、牛油等農產品大量進入臺灣，飲食文化進而改變習慣麵包牛奶等西式飲食。\n\n而印有「中美合作」、「淨重二十二公斤」及「上等麵粉」等紅藍字體的麵粉袋由質地柔軟堅韌的美國棉製成，在物資短缺的年代，被改製成内衣褲，成為台灣人「美援時代」共同的歷史記憶。而美式文化受國府默許成為彼時臺灣知識分子吸收外來思潮最安全、合法、甚至唯一的途徑，英語也取代日文成為具優勢的外國語言。而現代主義思潮隨著美國的文化宣傳被引入，對臺灣文學、藝術、美學觀念的影響延續至今。（王基倫, 陳建忠，2012， 217-223）\n\n\n U.S. Aid to Taiwan (美援)  \n\n\nU.S. Aid (美援) refers broadly to the large-scale, planned international assistance programs initiated by the United States after World War II. One of the most well-known programs was the European Recovery Program, proposed by U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall in 1947, which allocated $22 billion to help rebuild post-war Europe. In 1948, the Foreign Assistance Act was passed by the U.S. Congress, officially including the Republic of China (ROC) as a recipient of U.S. aid (Wang Tseng-Tsai, 1976, p. 329).  \n\n\nIn the context of Taiwan, U.S. Aid specifically refers to the assistance provided to the ROC government after it retreated to Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek, who was both President of the ROC and Chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT). Given Taiwan's strategic location as part of the First Island Chain in the Asia-Pacific region, it played a crucial role in the anti-Communist alliance alongside Western Europe, Japan, and South Korea. As a result, the United States provided Taiwan with economic and military assistance, beginning with the Mutual Security Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 1951 (Tai Tien-Chao, 2002, pp. 351-352).  \n\n\n Economic Impact of U.S. Aid on Taiwan  \n\nDuring the early years of U.S. aid, in 1951, it accounted for 13% of Taiwan’s Gross National Product (GNP). In 1957, U.S. aid transitioned from purely grants to a combination of grants and loans. By 1962, as Taiwan's economy developed and demonstrated the ability to accumulate foreign exchange reserves, U.S. aid shifted primarily to interest-free loans, reducing its share of Taiwan’s economy to 2%. The United States gradually decreased financial support, and by June 1965, the U.S. State Department officially ended economic assistance to Taiwan. In January 2004, the Taiwanese government fully repaid its outstanding loans to the United States (Tao Han, 2010, pp. 608-610).  \n\n\nBetween 1951 and 1965, Taiwan received a total of $1.482 billion in aid, which became a crucial resource for Taiwan’s economic and infrastructural development. The largest proportion of U.S. aid funds was allocated to infrastructure projects, leading to the construction of:  \n\n- Power plants  \n\n- Reservoirs  \n\n- Xiluo Bridge (*西螺大橋*)  \n\n- Central Cross-Island Highway (*中橫公路*)  \n\n- MacArthur Highway (*麥帥公路*)  \n\nAdditionally, urban planning projects, such as Taipei’s Minsheng Community (*民生社區*), were also influenced by U.S. aid (Mutual Construction Co., Ltd., 2012, p. 136).  \n\n\n Cultural and Social Influence of U.S. Aid  \n\nBeyond infrastructure, U.S. Aid had a profound impact on Taiwanese society and culture. One of the most tangible effects was changes in diet and lifestyle. Under Public Law 480, the ROC government was allowed to purchase surplus U.S. agricultural products using New Taiwan Dollars through the U.S. aid program. This led to an influx of wheat, corn, soybeans, and butter into Taiwan, introducing Western-style dietary habits such as bread and milk consumption, which became increasingly common.  \n\n\nAnother iconic cultural impact was the repurposing of flour sacks. The soft yet durable cotton fabric used for American flour sacks, often printed with red and blue characters reading \"Sino-American Cooperation,\" \"Net Weight: 22 kg,\" and \"Premium Flour,\" was widely reused to make underwear and clothing in times of material scarcity. This phenomenon became a shared historical memory for an entire generation in Taiwan.  \n\n\nFurthermore, American culture was tacitly endorsed by the KMT government, becoming the safest, most legitimate, and sometimes the only channel through which Taiwanese intellectuals could access foreign ideas. English gradually replaced Japanese as the dominant foreign language, and modernist thought, influenced by U.S. cultural promotion, shaped Taiwan’s literature, art, and aesthetic concepts, leaving a lasting legacy (Wang Ji-Lun & Chen Chien-Chung, 2012, pp. 217-223). \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n1. 護教反共/愛國護教\n\n1950年代世界局勢處於冷戰格局，在西方基督教界的普世教會合一運動下，1948年成立了普世教會協會（普世教協，WCC, World Council of Churches），由於普世教協接納社會主義國家的立場，後亦主張承認「中華人民共和國」，導致意識形態與國民黨政權產生矛盾與衝突。（林金水，2003，345）\n\n冷戰時期的台灣正處在黨國體制之中，政治的影響力處處可見，無可避免的台灣基督教也參在「護教反共/愛國護教」之中，造成了台灣基督教歷史發展的重大變化契機。國民黨要員張靜愚追隨美國基要派牧師卡爾．麥堅泰（Carl McIntire）批判普世教協的腳步，於1960年發起了「反共護教運動」，國語教會紛紛加入，指責普世教協對信仰多所妥協、有違聖經教訓。（黃克先，2021，23）\n\n1962年張靜愚發起基督教護教反共聯合會與普世教協對立。（黃克先，2021，23）1965年成立亞洲基督教反共聯合會，亞聯會成立的動機即是要淡化正捲入戒嚴時期最為敏感的「親共」疑雲中長老教會百年大會的影響力。1969年世界基督教反共聯合會成立，亞聯會仍然存在，直到隔年（1973年）兩者才正式合併。世聯會把所有目標都指向全面反共，以消滅共產黨為目的。張靜愚等人成立以基要派旗號又投身反共事業的基督教團體，除了是追隨麥堅泰之組織，亦有可能是蔣介石政權私下授意張去推動類似的組織，以達其政治目的。\n\n如今看來相對於麥堅泰的基要派是來自對自由神學的抵抗，反共護教下的基要派形成卻是以黨國、反共為優先。護教反共/愛國護教與長老教會、WCC的對立，並非基督教正統信仰的教義之爭，其目的主要是使黨政可以更為有效地監控和分化教會的政治意識形態之爭。\n\n\nApologetics and Anti-Communism / Patriotic Apologetics  \n\n\nDuring the 1950s, the global situation was shaped by the Cold War. Under the ecumenical movement within Western Christianity, the World Council of Churches (WCC) was established in 1948. Due to the WCC’s acceptance of socialist countries and its later advocacy for recognizing the People's Republic of China, conflicts arose between its ideological stance and that of the Kuomintang (KMT) regime. (Lin Jinshui, 2003, 345)  \n\n\nDuring the Cold War, Taiwan was under a party-state system, where political influence was pervasive. Consequently, Taiwanese Christianity inevitably became involved in the movement of \"Apologetics and Anti-Communism / Patriotic Apologetics,\" which led to significant changes in the historical development of Christianity in Taiwan. Zhang Jingyu, a key KMT figure, followed the lead of American fundamentalist pastor Carl McIntire in criticizing the WCC. In 1960, Zhang launched the \"Anti-Communist Apologetics Movement,\" with Mandarin-speaking churches joining in, accusing the WCC of making excessive compromises in faith and violating biblical teachings. (Huang Kexian, 2021, 23)  \n\n\nIn 1962, Zhang Jingyu founded the Christian Apologetics and Anti-Communism United Association to oppose the WCC. (Huang Kexian, 2021, 23) In 1965, the Asian Christian Anti-Communism United Association was established with the intent to diminish the influence of the Presbyterian Church’s centennial assembly, which was entangled in suspicions of being \"pro-Communist\" during Taiwan’s martial law period. In 1969, the World Christian Anti-Communism United Association was formed while the Asian association continued to exist, until the two officially merged in 1973. The World Association aimed entirely at opposing communism, with the eradication of the Communist Party as its ultimate goal. The fundamentalist Christian organizations established by Zhang Jingyu and others under the banner of fundamentalism and anti-communism were not only inspired by McIntire’s movement but were also possibly initiated under Chiang Kai-shek’s covert directive to promote similar organizations for political purposes.  \n\n\nIn retrospect, while McIntire’s fundamentalist movement stemmed from resistance to liberal theology, the formation of fundamentalism under the Anti-Communist Apologetics movement prioritized the party-state and anti-communism above all else. The confrontation between Apologetics and Anti-Communism / Patriotic Apologetics and the Presbyterian Church or the WCC was not a doctrinal dispute over orthodox Christian faith but rather a political struggle aimed at enabling the party-state to more effectively monitor and divide the political ideologies within the church.\n\n\n2.普世合一運動\n\n萌芽於19世紀、開展於20世紀的普世合一運動，是近代基督教發展史重要課題；1910年6月14日至23日舉辦的世界宣教會議（1910 World Missionary Conference，又稱愛丁堡世界宣教會議）標誌著現代普世教會合一運動的開始。會議中來自139 個不同新教教派的代表在這次會議體現了在傳播福音的同時使新教教派能合一的願望，而後代學者更以「新宗教改革」來指稱此次會議產生的普世運動。會議中英國長老教會在南台灣、加拿大長老教會在北台灣宣教成果名列該大會報告書內：「一切都有利於在台灣積極進取。在不大的土地上，障礙如此之少，而且條件如此有利於迅速而徹底的傳福音。」（Brian Stanley，2009）\n\n然而在1903年時，台灣南、北教會已有合併呼聲，惟因彼此教勢差異過大而未果，直到宣教會議後的1912年，世界潮流紛紛以「合一」為依歸，或因此影響雙方才正式組成「台灣大會」。而台灣大會在1944年結束前召開20屆會議，共同商討、策劃教制法規、宗教教育等事務，雙方也展開信仰與教制合作。而醫院、財產等事業則較缺乏合作共識，而最為棘手是神學校的聯合，也是合一運動下的一個遺憾。（盧啟明，2022，41-42）\n\n南北兩大會1951年合併成立總會開始，延續其宣教差會的普世關懷，隨即加入包括普世教會協會(WCC)的國際教會組織，世界歸正教會聯盟(WARC)、亞洲基督教協會(CCA)等。面對戰後各教派傳統來到台灣的歷史脈絡，PCT受到普世合一運動的影響，積極參與由主流教會（含天主教會）所組成的「教會合作委員會」(ECC)並推動國內的教會合一見證。先後積極促成了主日學協會、基督教論壇報（黃武東牧師曾任論壇報第一任社長），以及東海大學的創立（由彌迪理牧師促成）。這些都是台灣基督教史上的美好見證。但事實上，後來這些合作關係及模式都可說是以失敗告終，呈現出台灣教會合一運動的弔詭性。（黃伯和，2005，31-32）\n\n台灣教會在1960年代後的分裂與歐美教會的宗派分隔不同，台灣各宗派沒有經歷宗教改革的爭議與教義分歧的辯論，各宗派間的教義分歧沒有想像中的大。多數信徒的宗派意識是單純承襲自己所處的宗派的，而非自行選擇的。合一運動的失敗反而是受到歷史經驗、政治矛盾、意識型態與權力結構的影響。（黃伯和，2005，33）\n\n具有強烈合一性格的長老教會在國內因為屬於被殖民的族群，在政治、社會公義和身分認同無法伸張的情況下，想要和與統治者站在同一陣線的華語教會從事合一的努力，無可避免的面對一道難於克服的障礙。自此，兩方發展出完全不同的走向，相對於華語教會，長期參與、投入普世性教會組織的情形下，長老教會在信仰反省上受到普世教會以信仰立場關懷人權、社會公義、族群和諧、環境整全等思潮的影響。\n\n\nEcumenical Movement  \n\n\nThe ecumenical movement, which emerged in the 19th century and expanded in the 20th century, is a significant topic in modern Christian history. The World Missionary Conference, held from June 14 to 23, 1910 (also known as the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference), marked the beginning of the modern ecumenical movement. At this conference, representatives from 139 different Protestant denominations expressed their desire for unity among Protestant churches while spreading the gospel. Later scholars even referred to the movement initiated by this conference as a \"New Reformation.\" The conference report highlighted the missionary achievements of the British Presbyterian Church in southern Taiwan and the Canadian Presbyterian Church in northern Taiwan: \"Everything is favorable for active progress in Taiwan. On a relatively small land, there are so few obstacles, and the conditions are so conducive to rapid and thorough evangelization.\" (Brian Stanley, 2009)  \n\n\nHowever, as early as 1903, there were calls for a merger between the northern and southern churches in Taiwan. Yet, due to significant disparities in church strength, the merger did not materialize. It was not until 1912, following the World Missionary Conference, that the global trend toward \"unity\" may have influenced both sides to formally establish the \"Taiwan Assembly.\" Before its dissolution in 1944, the Taiwan Assembly held 20 meetings, jointly discussing and planning church regulations, religious education, and other matters. While faith and church governance cooperation progressed, there was a lack of consensus on hospital management and property affairs. The most challenging issue was the unification of theological seminaries, which remained an unresolved regret within the ecumenical movement. (Lu Qiming, 2022, 41-42)  \n\n\nWith the merger of the northern and southern assemblies in 1951 to establish the General Assembly, the mission board’s global perspective continued, leading to Taiwan's Presbyterian Church (PCT) joining international church organizations such as the World Council of Churches (WCC), the World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC), and the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Given the historical context of post-war denominational traditions arriving in Taiwan, the PCT, influenced by the ecumenical movement, actively participated in the \"Ecumenical Church Council\" (ECC), an organization formed by mainstream churches (including the Catholic Church), promoting church unity within Taiwan. The PCT played a key role in establishing the Sunday School Association, *Christian Tribune* (with Pastor Huang Wudong as its first president), and Tunghai University (facilitated by Pastor Milo L. Milmine). These efforts stand as significant testimonies in Taiwan’s Christian history. However, in reality, many of these collaborations and organizational models ultimately failed, highlighting the paradox of Taiwan's church unity movement. (Huang Bohe, 2005, 31-32)  \n\n\nThe divisions within Taiwan’s church after the 1960s differed from the denominational separations in Europe and the United States. Unlike Western churches, Taiwanese denominations did not undergo theological disputes related to the Reformation, and doctrinal differences between them were not as significant as often imagined. Most believers inherited their denominational identity rather than consciously choosing it. The failure of the unity movement was instead influenced by historical experiences, political conflicts, ideological struggles, and power structures. (Huang Bohe, 2005, 33)  \n\n\nThe Presbyterian Church, which strongly advocated unity, faced an insurmountable barrier in its efforts to unite with Mandarin-speaking churches, which were aligned with the ruling authorities. As a church belonging to a colonized ethnic group, the PCT found itself unable to extend its political, social justice, and identity concerns. Consequently, the two groups developed in entirely different directions. Unlike Mandarin-speaking churches, which were less involved in global ecumenical organizations, the Presbyterian Church, through its long-term participation, was profoundly influenced by the WCC’s emphasis on faith-based advocacy for human rights, social justice, ethnic harmony, and environmental sustainability. \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\n卡爾·麥堅泰\n\n小查爾斯‧柯蒂斯‧麥堅泰 ( Charles Curtis McIntire Jr.，1906 / 5 /17– 2002 /3 /19 )，又名卡爾‧麥堅泰(Carl McIntire ) 牧師，是美國保守教會聖經長老會（Bible Presbyterian Church）的創始人，萬國基督教會聯合會（ICCC, International Council of Christian Churches）的創始人和長期主席。麥堅泰基於《哥林多後書》 6:17強調了分離的教義（Doctrine of separation），強調了教會的純潔性，以及他認為自由主義者是對基督教信仰正統性的背離，他自豪地認為自己是原教旨主義者。與其他同時期的原教旨主義者一樣，麥堅泰也脫離了福音派團體，認為福音派已經向世俗妥協。（Matt Stefon，2011，323）\n\n1941 年他協助創立了美國基督教會理事會(ACCC, American Council of Christian Churches)，用以抵抗被認為是自由派的美國基督教會全國理事會(NCC National Council of Churches) 。1948年他同樣幫助成立了萬國基督教會聯合會（ICCC），以挑戰普世教會協會（WCC），而他當選 ICCC 首任主席，並連任直至其離世。自20 世紀 40 年代起，他多次環球宣講，既鼓勵國外的福音派基督徒，也表達他對普世教協的反對，其影響力遍及美國及海外。（Matt Stefon，2011，323）\n\n麥堅泰以堅決反共的立場獲得台灣的蔣介石政權認同，1961年麥堅泰一行人到台灣欲求見蔣介石，由唐縱和張寶樹提呈的公文上，除了介紹萬國基督教聯合會的性質與內容，尤其還特別提及了曾經派曾約農、張靜愚、成文秀三人參加了萬國教聯於1960年9月於漢城召開的第四屆大會。（曾慶豹，2017）當長老教會於1965年為慶祝宣教百週年而舉辦紀念活動時，麥堅泰或因台灣基督長老教會與普世教協的關係，進而指控長老教會將利用大型群眾運動「發動革命」，這樣錯謬的立場混淆了蔣介石政權以及台灣社會和教會的視聽。（鄭仰恩，2015，5-7）\n\n其後麥堅泰多次訪台，1970年底麥堅泰來台受訪就提出，如果中共進入聯合國，美國亦應退出，他並堅信越南的勝利才能維持東南亞地區的和平，並且對美國宣傳反共的活動非常重要。麥堅泰堅定反共的意識形態及對信仰純正性的強調深深影響了台灣基要派的路線。相對於另外一位佈道家葛理翰，雖早期極力反共但慢慢開展福音佈道而開啟了美國福音派路線，便不再受到台灣基要派的歡迎，麥堅泰對蔣介石政權的政策和教會界則產生頗大的長期影響力。\n\n但他雖是頗有天賦的宣講者，但對於政治的熱情大於聖經。非常有人格魅力的他可以輕鬆的向聽眾募款，但他也無法忍受分享權力，常與共事人發生齷齪，同時幾乎沒有值得信賴的人能管理各組織，致使同時期與麥堅泰相關的各組織其實已負債累累、分崩離析。\n\n\nCarl McIntire  \n\n\nCharles Curtis McIntire Jr. (May 17, 1906 – March 19, 2002), also known as Pastor Carl McIntire, was the founder of the Bible Presbyterian Church, the International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC), and its long-term chairman. McIntire emphasized the doctrine of separation, based on 2 Corinthians 6:17, stressing the purity of the church and condemning liberalism as a deviation from Christian orthodoxy. He proudly identified as a fundamentalist. Like other fundamentalists of his time, McIntire distanced himself from evangelical groups, believing that they had compromised with secularism. (Matt Stefon, 2011, 323)  \n\n\nIn 1941, he helped establish the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC) to counter the National Council of Churches (NCC), which he viewed as a liberal organization. Similarly, in 1948, he assisted in founding the International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC) to challenge the World Council of Churches (WCC). He was elected the ICCC's first chairman and remained in the position until his death. From the 1940s onward, McIntire frequently traveled the world, encouraging evangelical Christians abroad while expressing his opposition to the WCC. His influence extended both within the United States and internationally. (Matt Stefon, 2011, 323)  \n\n\nMcIntire's staunch anti-communist stance gained the approval of Chiang Kai-shek’s regime in Taiwan. In 1961, McIntire and his delegation sought an audience with Chiang, and an official document submitted by Tang Tsung and Chang Baoshu not only introduced the nature and objectives of the ICCC but also specifically mentioned that Zeng Yuannong, Zhang Jingyu, and Cheng Wenxiu had attended the ICCC’s fourth conference in Seoul in September 1960. (Zeng Qingbao, 2017) When the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan organized a centennial celebration for its missionary work in 1965, McIntire, likely due to the church’s affiliation with the WCC, accused it of planning to launch a revolutionary mass movement. This erroneous claim confused both Chiang Kai-shek’s government and Taiwanese society and churches. (Zheng Yang'en, 2015, 5-7)  \n\n\nMcIntire visited Taiwan multiple times thereafter. In late 1970, during an interview in Taiwan, he asserted that if Communist China were to enter the United Nations, the United States should withdraw. He also firmly believed that a victory in Vietnam was essential for maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and that promoting anti-communist efforts in the U.S. was of utmost importance. McIntire’s unwavering anti-communist ideology and emphasis on doctrinal purity profoundly influenced the trajectory of Taiwan’s fundamentalist movement. In contrast, another evangelist, Billy Graham, who initially held strong anti-communist views but later focused on gospel outreach and led the American evangelical movement, was no longer welcomed by Taiwan’s fundamentalists. Meanwhile, McIntire maintained a significant and long-lasting influence on both Chiang Kai-shek’s policies and Taiwan’s church community.  \n\n\nDespite being a gifted preacher, McIntire’s passion for politics often outweighed his focus on the Bible. His charismatic personality allowed him to raise funds effortlessly from audiences, but he was unwilling to share power and frequently clashed with colleagues. Additionally, he lacked trusted individuals to manage the various organizations he founded, leading to financial struggles and internal disintegration among many of his affiliated institutions.\n\n\n煮雲法師\n\n釋煮雲（1919/2/23-1986/8/9），江蘇省如皋縣人，是台灣佛教史上重要的佛教法師之一。於1950年隨國軍來臺，積極實踐推廣佛教的宏願，導正戰後臺灣初期佛教的習俗，後來以念佛法門改變臺灣佛教風氣。（釋煮雲，1988，3-28）\n\n1953年起駐錫鳳山蓮社，並在同年成為第一位到東台灣弘法的漢傳佛教法師，在數次東部與南投的交流中，煮雲法師並對基督宗教以物質、金錢利誘原住民信教的狀況展開批判反擊，用語之大膽尖銳（釋煮雲，1988，31），在1950年代，因蔣介石與夫人都是基督徒，大環境對基督教有利的情況下，非常少見。這種對基督宗教有利的環境亦滋生出以基督教為靠山的不法行動，（江燦騰，1996，473）當時慧峰法師（1909-1973，亦為中國來台之僧人，先後駐錫基隆靈泉寺、新竹元光寺）甚至曾收到信件，信中畫了「一枝手槍」寫著：「你們下次再談到基督教的事，我就拿這個東西對付你！」\n\n1955年慧峰法師請煮雲法師到臺南佈教，煮雲法師即以「佛教與基督教的比較｣為題，於7月29日30日及8月2日3日於赤崁樓康樂台開講，並由莫正熹寫黑板，李至剛做筆記，李邦魁翻譯，高慧芬負責宣傳。後內容被由佛教徒李至剛記錄成書出版。當中煮雲法師對佛教與基督教比較之後，得出的結論是：佛教比基督教能「迎合我們的國情｣，信上帝不能得救，祈禱上帝不能贖罪，「基督教應該要體念國家的元氣，與佛教徒和平相處，不要處心積慮，明槍暗箭的搗亂佛教。｣\n\n《佛教與基督教的比較》出版後，部分基督徒認為此為佛教界對基督教十分惡毒的攻擊，言語十分的粗暴，毒辣。《基督教生命雙月刊》的主筆吳恩溥（主要從事文字工作，曾主編與創辦多份基督教刊物，如《導向》、《呼喊》等，常有護教作品）寫了《駁佛教與基督教的比較》一文。\n\n1956年夏秋之際在軍中尚未再度出家的聖嚴法師讀了吳著後，十天之中寫成《評「駁佛教與基督教之比較」》一書五萬餘字，並透過煮雲交由高雄慶芳書局出版。書中認為吳恩溥「持論荒謬，語氣毒辣，筆調輕率幼稚」，「不識時務與不學無術，我們從他所說的荒謬言論中隨地都可以找出證明」。後經國大代表也是善導寺負責人李子寬來函調停，才使紛爭的場面逐漸平息，而基督教也減少以佛教為攻擊的傳教行為，成為此世代重要的耶佛論戰。\n\n而此年也是煮雲個人弘法極有成績的一年，首先在蓮社成立「鳳山佛教青年弘法團」破除佛教是老人宗教的印象。（丁敏，1999，292）透過對於佛教法義的提升，運用通俗易解現代化表達弘法，以及高度善巧的攝受方便，引導民眾踏進佛門的階石。一生宏揚淨土法門，而創辦精進佛七。加強了佛七的內容，增進了佛七的功效，將大專青年、社會青年、一般信眾、少年兒童，以分期、分齡、分等的方式進行，來適應各種年齡層面的體能和心智，也擴展了參加佛七者的層面。（丁敏，1999，298-299）這種普及佛化，成為近代台灣佛教史上的一大特色，煮雲法師更在南台灣與東台灣佛教界有著重要的地位。1986年煮雲因高血壓宿疾圓寂於鳳山蓮社之「懺悔堂」。\n\n\nMaster Zhu Yun  \n\n\nShi Zhu Yun (February 23, 1919 – August 9, 1986), a native of Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, was one of the most significant Buddhist masters in Taiwan's Buddhist history. He arrived in Taiwan with the Nationalist military in 1950 and actively promoted Buddhism, seeking to rectify post-war Taiwanese Buddhist customs. Later, he transformed the Buddhist atmosphere in Taiwan through the practice of the Nianfo (Recitation of the Buddha’s Name) method. (Shi Zhu Yun, 1988, 3-28)  \n\n\nIn 1953, he took residence at Fengshan Lotus Society and became the first Han Chinese Buddhist master to preach in eastern Taiwan. During his visits to eastern Taiwan and Nantou, he strongly criticized and countered Christianity’s material and financial inducements to convert Indigenous peoples, using particularly bold and sharp language. (Shi Zhu Yun, 1988, 31) Such an open critique was rare in the 1950s when the political climate favored Christianity due to Chiang Kai-shek and his wife being Christians. This pro-Christian environment also facilitated illicit activities by those who used Christianity as a shield. (Chiang Tsan-Teng, 1996, 473) At the time, another Buddhist monk, Master Hui Feng (1909–1973), who had also come from China and served at Keelung Lingquan Temple and Hsinchu Yuanguang Temple, even received a letter with a drawing of a pistol and the words: \"If you mention Christianity again, I will deal with you with this!\"  \n\n\nIn 1955, Master Hui Feng invited Master Zhu Yun to preach in Tainan. Zhu Yun delivered a series of lectures titled \"A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity\" at the Chihkan Tower Recreation Platform on July 29-30 and August 2-3. The lectures were supported by Mo Zhengxi, who wrote on the blackboard; Li Zhigang, who took notes; Li Bangkui, who provided translations; and Gao Huifen, who managed publicity. The content was later compiled into a book by Buddhist follower Li Zhigang. In his comparative analysis, Zhu Yun concluded that Buddhism was better suited to \"our national conditions\" than Christianity, arguing that belief in God does not lead to salvation and that praying to God cannot atone for sins. He also urged: \"Christianity should consider the vitality of the nation and coexist peacefully with Buddhists instead of scheming and launching covert attacks to disrupt Buddhism.\"  \n\n\nAfter the publication of *A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity*, some Christians viewed it as a harsh attack against Christianity, deeming the language hostile and vicious. Wu Enpu, the chief writer of *Christian Life Bimonthly*—who was involved in Christian publishing and apologetics and had founded and edited periodicals such as *Guidance* and *Call*—wrote *A Rebuttal to 'A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity'*.  \n\n\nDuring the summer and autumn of 1956, before re-ordaining as a monk, Master Sheng Yen read Wu's rebuttal and, within ten days, wrote a 50,000-character response titled *A Critique of 'A Rebuttal to A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity'*, which was published by Kaohsiung Qingfang Bookstore through Zhu Yun’s arrangement. In his critique, Sheng Yen described Wu Enpu’s arguments as \"absurd, vicious, and childishly superficial\", stating that \"his words reveal both a lack of awareness of current affairs and a lack of scholarly training. His fallacious claims can be refuted at every turn.\" The conflict eventually subsided after Li Zikuan, a National Assembly representative and head of Shandao Temple, mediated between the two sides. As a result, Christian proselytizing efforts that aggressively targeted Buddhism diminished, making this one of the most significant Buddhist-Christian theological debates of the era.  \n\n\n1956 was also a landmark year for Zhu Yun’s Buddhist outreach efforts. At the Fengshan Lotus Society, he established the Fengshan Buddhist Youth Preaching Group, breaking the stereotype that Buddhism was only for the elderly. (Ding Min, 1999, 292) Through the enhancement of Buddhist doctrinal understanding, the use of modern and accessible language, and skillful teaching methods, he successfully guided people into Buddhism. He dedicated his life to promoting the Pure Land tradition, establishing the Jingjin Seven-Day Retreat (Buddhist chanting retreats), refining its structure, and tailoring sessions for different age groups—university students, young adults, general believers, and children—ensuring that both their physical endurance and spiritual needs were met. (Ding Min, 1999, 298-299) This popularization of Buddhism became a defining feature of modern Taiwanese Buddhist history, and Zhu Yun held a significant position in both southern and eastern Taiwan's Buddhist communities.  \n\n\nIn 1986, Master Zhu Yun passed away due to chronic hypertension at the \"Repentance Hall\" of Fengshan Lotus Society. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\n1. 萬國教聯（International Council of Christian Churches）\n\n萬國教聯（ICCC ）於 1948 年 8 月 12 日在阿姆斯特丹英國歸正教會成立，是具有強烈原教旨主義信仰（fundamentalist beliefs）的跨教派教會理事會，其特點是激進地反對自由主義傾向普世教會協會（WCC）、共產主義和在其眼中背離正統的基督教。在鐵幕時代與四大洲的主要政治決策者保持聯繫，並在鐵幕後建立了廣泛的信息提供者和合作者網絡。（陳慧宏，2023，208）\n\nICCC的成員類型包括全國性的教會團體、地方教會與相關機構（例如傳教士團體和聖經聯盟）從 1948 年成立到 1975 年世界原教旨主義者大會（World Congress of Fundamentalists）成立前，萬國教聯是同類中唯一的原教旨主義或「相信聖經」基督教會和附屬教會組織全球資訊共享、協調和合作的單一國際組織。\n\n萬國教聯的傳教機構被稱為聯合傳教團 ( The Associated Missions ,TAM)，同時也經營國際基督教救濟組織。青年運動其名為「國際基督教青年」（International Christian Youth）為不願加入WCC的普世運動者提供替代的普世交流機會。（McIntire, Carl，檢索時間2024）\n\n主要創始人是美國長老會牧師卡爾·麥堅泰 (Carl McIntire)，他還領導創立了聖經長老會（Bible Presbyterian Church）、謝爾頓學院（Shelton College）和美國基督教會理事會（The American Council of Christian Churches,ACCC）。運動的主要刊物是麥金泰爾的《基督教燈塔》（Christian Beacon）周刊，總部設在新澤西州科林斯伍德的聖經長老會教堂（Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood），他是該教堂的牧師。也因其頗受爭議的「二十世紀宗教改革時刻」（Twentieth Century Reformation Hour）廣播而廣為人知。（Matt Stefon，2011，323）\n\n1972年時萬國教聯成員中有155個「相信聖經的新教教派」的會員，其中大多數規模較小。1980 年代中期在西歐、美洲、東南亞和撒哈拉以南非洲擁有近 400 個會員教派或教會，據稱會員人數達 5500 萬。然而縱觀其歷史，曾經有過一些離開萬國教聯之成員，而原因通常是與麥金泰本人的分歧所致。\n\n萬國教聯總部位於荷蘭阿姆斯特丹和美國新澤西州科林斯伍德設有辦事處，在非洲、中東、拉丁美洲、遠東、加拿大、美國和歐洲設有國家辦事處。每年舉行地區和國家理事會會議，而萬國教聯的世界大會刻意選擇與普世教協大會相同城市或鄰近地區舉行。並在 89 個國家以 16 種語言出版約 34 種期刊\n\n\nInternational Council of Christian Churches (ICCC)  \n\n\nThe International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC) was founded on August 12, 1948, at the British Reformed Church in Amsterdam. It is a trans-denominational council of churches with strong fundamentalist beliefs, characterized by its militant opposition to the liberal-leaning World Council of Churches (WCC), communism, and what it perceives as deviations from orthodox Christianity. During the Iron Curtain era, ICCC maintained connections with major political decision-makers across four continents and later established an extensive network of informants and collaborators after the Cold War. (Chen Huihong, 2023, 208)  \n\n\nICCC's membership includes national church organizations, local churches, and related institutions (such as missionary societies and Bible alliances). From its founding in 1948 until the establishment of the World Congress of Fundamentalists in 1975, ICCC was the only global fundamentalist or \"Bible-believing\" Christian church organization that served as a platform for information sharing, coordination, and cooperation.  \n\n\nICCC’s missionary wing was called The Associated Missions (TAM), and it also operated an international Christian relief organization. Its youth movement, known as International Christian Youth, provided an alternative ecumenical platform for Christians who did not wish to join the WCC. (McIntire, Carl, retrieved in 2024)  \n\n\nThe ICCC was primarily founded by American Presbyterian pastor Carl McIntire, who also led the creation of the Bible Presbyterian Church, Shelton College, and the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC). The movement’s main publication was McIntire’s Christian Beacon, a weekly newspaper headquartered at the Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood, New Jersey, where he served as pastor. McIntire was also widely known for his controversial radio program, *Twentieth Century Reformation Hour*. (Matt Stefon, 2011, 323)  \n\n\nBy 1972, the ICCC had 155 Bible-believing Protestant denominations as members, most of which were relatively small. By the mid-1980s, its membership had grown to nearly 400 denominations or churches in Western Europe, the Americas, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated 55 million adherents. However, throughout its history, some members left the ICCC due to disagreements with McIntire himself.  \n\n\nICCC’s headquarters were located in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with an additional office in Collingswood, New Jersey, USA. The organization maintained national offices in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, East Asia, Canada, the United States, and Europe. ICCC held regional and national council meetings annually, and its World Congress was deliberately scheduled in the same cities or nearby locations as WCC assemblies. The council published approximately 34 periodicals in 16 languages across 89 countries. \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n1. 禁用羅馬字\n\n羅馬字是教會通訊、報紙、聖經、聖詩，及學校教育極佳的工具，傳播迅速影響力大，1880年代在台灣曾擁有數十萬的讀者人口。但到了日治時期，總督府即禁止教會學校使用母語，以及禮拜與聖經課程；1931年後進一步強制說國語（日語），禁止使用羅馬字聖經；戰爭末期1942年強迫《台灣教會公報》停刊。（張立夫，2005，23-24）\n\n國民黨來台後，從1946年設立直隸於「台灣省行政長官公署」的「國語推行委員會」起，此後40年間推行語言同化政策，學校禁止使用台灣各族群的母語。1946年國語推行委員會頒布「國語運動六大綱領」，次年此委員會改組為「台灣省政府國語推行委員會」。\n\n1959年，省教育廳的國語推行委員會宣告廢止（併入省教育廳），但各縣市仍設有「國語推行委員會」；1964年省政府通令機關學校在辦公時間「禁止講方言」的訓令，必須一律使用國語；1970年因實行中華文化復興運動，公布「加強推行國語辦法」；1973年公布「台灣省各縣山地鄉國語推行辦法」可見當時的原住民族地區，國語仍未普及；1974年公布「台灣省各縣市加強國語教育改進要點」；1981年，政府在教育部底下恢復設置「國語推行委員會」。（黃純敏，2005，105）「國語政策」40年間成效顯著，獲得極大的成功，相對地，本土語言（包括原住民族語言）逐漸式微，面臨滅絕的危機。而政府對於族語聖經的翻譯與使用的壓制，就與國語政策的強力推行有關，其中最重要的組織，就是前述的「國語推行委員會」。\n\n政府的干預包括兩個面向：（1）各族族語注音字母的制訂：制訂各族族語「注音字」（ㄅㄆㄇ），期待讓不同族的翻譯拼音法能盡量統一。（2）族語聖經及聖詩的查禁：早在1952年，布農語〈馬太福音〉（羅馬字版，香港聖經公會）出版之時，警員便經常干涉，有些地方甚至沒收此書。（酋卡爾，1998，573-574）直到1955年下令禁止教會使用羅馬字；1957年，省教育廳通令各縣市取締白話字聖經，禁止以台灣本土語言傳教；1969年，地方教會的聖經及聖詩陸續遭到沒收。（張立夫，2005，23-24）\n\n值得注意的是，族語聖經受到嚴格查禁的時間，是在台灣「退出聯合國」的1970年代。阿美語新約聖經、布農語新約聖經泰雅語新約聖經分別在1972年、1973年與1974年尚得相繼出版。但到了1974年，和平鄉Tayal(泰雅族)博愛教會禮拜進行中，警察進入教堂強行帶走Tayal語聖經及聖詩。\n\n次年1975年一月警備總部率警察進入聖經公會沒收新譯的台語羅馬字聖經（紅皮聖經）2200本，（盧俊義，2017）驚動世界聖經公會總幹事專程為此來台拜會，駐美大使沈昌煥亦不堪國際教會譴責與壓力，回國報告，國民黨政權才退還其中之6百本。（王南傑，2011：61）1984年，教育部仍有函請內政部禁止山地教會使用羅馬字傳教，並禁止族語文字的書刊及聖經等。\n\n\nProhibition of Romanization  \n\n\nRomanization was an excellent tool for church communication, newspapers, the Bible, hymns, and school education, allowing for rapid dissemination and significant influence. In the 1880s, Taiwan had hundreds of thousands of Romanized script readers. However, during Japanese rule, the Governor-General’s Office banned the use of native languages in church schools, worship services, and Bible classes. After 1931, the authorities further mandated the use of Japanese as the national language and prohibited the use of Romanized script Bibles. In the final years of World War II, the Taiwan Church News was forcibly shut down in 1942. (Chang Lifu, 2005, 23-24)  \n\n\nAfter the Kuomintang (KMT) arrived in Taiwan, the government continued language assimilation policies. In 1946, it established the Mandarin Promotion Committee under the Taiwan Provincial Executive Office. Over the next 40 years, schools were forbidden from using native languages, including those of Taiwan’s various ethnic groups. That same year, the committee issued six major guidelines for the Mandarin movement, and in 1947, it was reorganized into the Taiwan Provincial Government Mandarin Promotion Committee.  \n\n\nIn 1959, the Provincial Department of Education absorbed the Mandarin Promotion Committee, but similar committees remained active at county and city levels. In 1964, the government issued an official directive prohibiting the use of dialects in workplaces and requiring the exclusive use of Mandarin. In 1970, the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Movement led to the publication of the \"Mandarin Promotion Guidelines.\" In 1973, the government introduced the \"Mandarin Promotion Measures for Mountainous Areas,\" indicating that Mandarin was still not widespread in Indigenous regions at the time. This was followed by the \"Guidelines for Strengthening Mandarin Education\" in 1974. In 1981, the government re-established the Mandarin Promotion Committee under the Ministry of Education. (Huang Chunmin, 2005, 105)  \n\n\nOver 40 years, the Mandarin policy was highly effective, achieving significant success in linguistic assimilation. However, it also led to the decline and near extinction of local languages, including Indigenous languages. The government's suppression of the translation and use of Bibles in local languages was closely linked to the aggressive enforcement of the Mandarin policy, with the Mandarin Promotion Committee playing a crucial role.  \n\n\n Government Interventions  \n\n\nThe government's suppression of native-language religious materials took two primary forms:  \n\n\n1. Standardizing phonetic systems for Indigenous languages: The government imposed a Zhuyin-based phonetic system (ㄅㄆㄇ) for Indigenous languages, aiming to unify different phonetic transcription methods.  \n\n2. Banning native-language Bibles and hymns:  \n\n   - As early as 1952, when the Bunun-language Gospel of Matthew (Romanized script, published by the Hong Kong Bible Society) was released, police frequently interfered and, in some places, even confiscated copies. (Chief Karl, 1998, 573-574)  \n\n   - In 1955, the government banned the use of Romanized script in churches.  \n\n   - In 1957, the Provincial Department of Education ordered the confiscation of colloquial-language Bibles and prohibited evangelism in local Taiwanese languages.  \n\n   - In 1969, local churches saw their Bibles and hymnals confiscated. (Chang Lifu, 2005, 23-24)  \n\n\nNotably, the strictest crackdown on native-language Bibles coincided with Taiwan’s expulsion from the United Nations in the 1970s. Despite this, New Testament translations in Amis, Bunun, and Atayal languages were still published in 1972, 1973, and 1974, respectively. However, by 1974, police raided Bo’ai Church in Heping Township during a worship service and confiscated all Atayal-language Bibles and hymnals.  \n\n\nIn January 1975, the Taiwan Garrison Command, accompanied by police officers, raided the Bible Society, confiscating 2,200 newly translated Taiwanese Romanized Bibles (the \"Red-Cover Bible\"). (Lu Junyi, 2017) This shocked the international Christian community, prompting the Secretary-General of the United Bible Societies to visit Taiwan in protest. The Republic of China’s ambassador to the U.S., Shen Changhuan, unable to withstand international church condemnation and pressure, reported the situation to Taiwan, leading the KMT government to return 600 of the seized copies. (Wang Nanjie, 2011: 61)  \n\n\nEven as late as 1984, the Ministry of Education requested the Ministry of the Interior to prohibit mountain-area churches from using Romanized script in evangelism and to ban publications and Bibles written in Indigenous scripts.\n\n\n2. 1955年煮雲法師於赤崁樓康樂台之講法（闞正宗，1996，191-222）\n\n1955年慧峰法師請煮雲法師到臺南佈教，煮雲法師即以「佛教與基督教的比較｣為題，於7月29日30日及8月2日3日於赤崁樓康樂台開講，並由莫正熹寫黑板，李至剛做筆記，李邦魁翻譯，高慧芬負責宣傳。後內容被由佛教徒李至剛記錄成書出版。當中煮雲法師對佛教與基督教比較之後，得出的結論是：佛教比基督教能「迎合我們的國情｣，信上帝不能得救，祈禱上帝不能贖罪，「基督教應該要體念國家的元氣，與佛教徒和平相處，不要處心積慮，明槍暗箭的搗亂佛教。｣（煮雲，1988，90-98）\n\n《佛教與基督教的比較》出版後，部分基督徒認為此為佛教界對基督教十分惡毒的攻擊，言語十分的粗暴，毒辣。（吳恩溥，）《基督教生命雙月刊》的主筆吳恩溥（主要從事文字工作，曾主編與創辦多份基督教刊物，如《導向》、《呼喊》等，常有護教作品）寫了《駁佛教與基督教的比較》一文。\n\n1956年夏秋之際在軍中尚未再度出家的聖嚴法師讀了吳著後，十天之中寫成《評「駁佛教與基督教之比較」》一書五萬餘字，並透過煮雲交由高雄慶芳書局出版。書中認為吳恩溥「持論荒謬，語氣毒辣，筆調輕率幼稚」，「不識時務與不學無術，我們從他所說的荒謬言論中隨地都可以找出證明」。（聖嚴，1999， 337）後經國大代表也是善導寺負責人李子寬來函調停，才使紛爭的場面逐漸平息，而基督教也減少以佛教為攻擊的傳教行為，成為此世代重要的耶佛論戰。\n\n\n Master Zhu Yun’s 1955 Lecture at Chihkan Tower Recreation Platform  \n\n\nIn 1955, Master Hui Feng invited Master Zhu Yun to preach in Tainan. Zhu Yun delivered a series of lectures titled \"A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity\" on July 29-30 and August 2-3 at the Chihkan Tower Recreation Platform. The lectures were supported by Mo Zhengxi, who wrote on the blackboard; Li Zhigang, who took notes; Li Bangkui, who translated; and Gao Huifen, who handled publicity. The content was later compiled into a book by Li Zhigang, a Buddhist follower.  \n\n\nAfter comparing Buddhism and Christianity, Zhu Yun concluded that Buddhism was more suited to \"our national conditions\" than Christianity. He asserted that belief in God does not lead to salvation and that prayer to God cannot atone for sins. He further urged, \"Christianity should consider the vitality of the nation and coexist peacefully with Buddhists instead of scheming and launching covert attacks to disrupt Buddhism.\" (Zhu Yun, 1988, 90-98)  \n\n\nFollowing the publication of *A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity*, some Christians regarded it as a vicious attack on Christianity, criticizing the language as harsh and malicious. (Wu Enpu, unknown date) Wu Enpu, the chief writer of *Christian Life Bimonthly*—who was also a publisher and editor of Christian periodicals such as *Guidance* and *Call*—authored a rebuttal essay titled *A Refutation of \"A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity.\"*  \n\n\nDuring the summer and autumn of 1956, before re-ordaining as a monk, Master Sheng Yen read Wu’s work and, within ten days, wrote a 50,000-character response titled *A Critique of \"A Refutation of A Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity\"*. He had the book published by Kaohsiung Qingfang Bookstore through Master Zhu Yun’s arrangement. In his critique, Sheng Yen described Wu Enpu’s arguments as \"absurd, vicious, and childishly superficial\", stating that \"his words reveal both a lack of awareness of current affairs and a lack of scholarly training. His fallacious claims can be refuted at every turn.\" (Sheng Yen, 1999, 337)  \n\n\nThe conflict gradually subsided after Li Zikuan, a National Assembly representative and head of Shandao Temple, mediated the dispute. As a result, Christian evangelism efforts that aggressively targeted Buddhism diminished, making this one of the most significant Buddhist-Christian theological debates of the era. ",
