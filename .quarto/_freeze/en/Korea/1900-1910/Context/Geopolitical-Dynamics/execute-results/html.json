The declining Joseon Dynasty tried to preserve its rule by navigating the complex political and diplomatic tensions between neighboring Russia, China, and Japan. Additionally, it sought to build a close relationship with the United States through missionaries. However, the great powers sought to exploit Korea for their own national interests.\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the unequal treaties between Japan and Korea, as well as between Japan and other countries.\n\n\nTable 2.

However, due to conflicts over Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, Russia and Japan severed diplomatic relations and went to war in February 1904. Japan unilaterally formed an alliance based on the premise of mutual defense.It is a treaty that was secretly concluded on February 23, 1904, between Lee Ji-yong, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Korean Empire, and Hayashi Gonsuke, the Japanese Minister to Korea.\n\n\n The original statement: https://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/pw/19040223.T1E.html#:~:text=For%20the%20purpose%20of%20maintaining,regard%20to%20improvements%20in%20administration.\n\n\nARTICLE I.

The Imperial Government of Japan may, for the attainment of the above-mentioned object, occupy, when the circumstances require it, such places as may be necessary from strategical points of view.\n\nARTICLE V.

Details in connection with the present Protocol shall be arranged, as the circumstances may require, between the Representative of Japan and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Corea.\n\n\nThe First Japan-Korea Treaty\n\n\nBackground: It was a treaty concluded during the Russo-Japanese War when the situation was turning in Japan’s favor.  \n\nThe original statement: https://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/pw/19040822.T1E.html\n\n\nThe Second Japan-Korea\n\n\nBackground: Emperor Gojong opposed the treaty that would strip Korea of its diplomatic rights. In response, Japan sent General Ito Hirobumi, who individually asked each of the ministers whether they were for or against the treaty. Emperor Gojong did not attend this meeting. Among the eight ministers present, five voted in favor. Japan surrounded the royal palace and coerced the government ministers into proclaiming the treaty.\n\nThe original statement\n\nhttps://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/pw/19051117.T1E.html\n\nARTICLE I. The Government of Japan, through the Department of Foreign Affairs at Tokyo, will hereafter have control and direction of the external relations and affairs of Corea, and the diplomatic and consular representatives of Japan will have the charge of the subjects and interests of Corea in foreign countries.\n\nARTICLE II.

He shall have the right of private and personal audience of His Majesty the Emperor of Corea. The Japanese Government shall also have the right to station Residents at the several open ports and such other places in Corea as they may deem necessary. Such Residents shall, under the direction of the Resident General, exercise the powers and functions hitherto appertaining to Japanese Consuls in Corea and shall perform such duties as may be necessary in order to carry into full effect the provisions of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE IV. The stipulations of all Treaties and Agreements existing between Japan and Corea, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, shall continue in force.\n\nARTICLE V. The Government of Japan undertake to maintain the welfare and dignity of the Imperial House of Corea. In faith whereof, the Undersigned duly authorized by their Governments have signed this Agreement and affixed their seals.\n\n\nThe third Japan-Korea Treaty \n\n\nBackground: After refusing to sign the Second Japan-Korea Treaty in 1905, Emperor Gojong secretly sent envoys Lee Sang-seol, Lee Jun, and Lee Wi-jong to the Second Hague Peace Conference in June 1907. This was an attempt to inform the world of Japan's unjust invasion of the Korean Empire following the Russo-Japanese War and to seek assistance from the Western powers. Despite the active support of American missionary Homer Hulbert in raising awareness of the invasion through Western media, the Korean envoys were largely ignored by the representatives of the participating nations, leaving the Korean Empire even more isolated. As a result of this incident, Emperor Gojong was dethroned, and a treaty was subsequently signed to further solidify colonial rule.\n\nThe original statement: http://contents.history.go.kr/mobile/hm/view.do?levelId=hm_121_0080\n\n\nArticle 1: The Korean government shall receive guidance from the Resident-General regarding administrative reforms.\n\nArticle 2: The enactment of laws and important administrative measures by the Korean government shall require prior approval from the Resident-General.\n\nArticle 3: Judicial affairs in Korea shall be distinguished from general administrative affairs.\n\nArticle 4: The appointment and dismissal of high-ranking officials in Korea shall be executed with the consent of the Resident-General.\n\nArticle 5: The Korean government shall appoint Japanese nationals recommended by the Resident-General as Korean officials.\n\nArticle 6: The Korean government shall not invite or employ foreigners without the consent of the Resident-General.\n\n\nUntil the signing of the Eulsa Treaty in 1910, as detailed above, Japan gradually stripped the Korean Empire of its authority and, in the process, entered into unequal treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and others. These unequal treaties were initially necessary to justify Japan's colonial rule over Korea, and the Western powers passively allowed Korea's colonization. This is evidenced by the fact that the envoys sent by Emperor Gojong to the Hague were thoroughly ignored by the Western representatives at the Paris Peace Conference. However, these unequal treaties later became obstacles for the Government-General of Korea in controlling foreign missionaries, and the churches, schools, and hospitals they established in Korea. ",
