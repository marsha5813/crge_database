The first religious-related regulation announced was the \"Regulations on Religious Proclamation\" (Governor-General Ordinance No. 45), issued in November 1906. Until the \"Proselytizing Rules\" were implemented in 1915, the \"Regulations on Religious Proclamation\" were used for ten years to appease, control, or suppress Korean religions in accordance with the colonial rule situation. Below is the original text of this regulation and its full English translation.\n\n\nRules Regarding the Proclamation of Religion\n\n\nArticle 1: When a denomination or sect belonging to Shinto, Buddhism, or other religions within the Empire wishes to engage in missionary activities, the person in charge or an equivalent authority must select a representative in Korea, attach a resume, and submit the following information through the supervising consul to obtain the approval of the Resident-General.\n\nMethod of propagation\n\nMethod of supervision of the propagator\n\n\nArticle 2: Except in the case described in the previous article, when an imperial subject wishes to engage in the proclamation of religion, they must prepare the required information regarding the name of the religion and the method of propagation, attach a resume, and obtain the approval of the Resident-General through the supervising consul.\n\n\nArticle 3: When intending to establish a temple, hall, synagogue, preaching place, or lecture hall for religious purposes, the manager of the denomination or sect or the propagator mentioned in the previous article must provide the following information and obtain the approval of the supervising consul in the location where the establishment is planned.\n\nName and location\n\nName of the religion\n\nMethod of management and maintenance\n\n\nArticle 4: When the manager of a denomination or sect, the propagator mentioned in Article 2, or any imperial subject wishes to take charge of managing a Korean temple, they must attach the necessary documents and obtain approval from the Resident-General through the supervising consul in the location of the temple.\n\n\nArticle 5: If there is a desire to change the matters approved in the previous articles, re-approval must be obtained.\n\n\nArticle 6: The manager of a denomination or sect or the propagator mentioned in Article 2 must report the names and qualifications of the propagators to the supervising consul, and the same applies when there are changes to these propagators.\n\n\n종교의 선포에 관한 규칙\n\n제 1조 . 제국에 있어서의 신도, 불교, 그 외의 종교에 속하는 교파 종파로 포교에 종사하고자할 때는 해당관장 또는 이제 준하는 자가 한국에 있어서의 관리자를 선정하여 이력서를 첨부하고 다음의 사항을 구비햐여 관할이사관을 경유하여 통감의 인가를 받아야한다. \n\n포교의 방법\n\n포교자의 감독방법\n\n\n제2조.  전조  (前條)의 경우를 제외하고 제국신민으로 종교의 선포에 종사하고자 할 때는, 종교의 명칭 및 포교의 방법에 관한 사항을 구비하고 이력서를 첨부하여 관할 이사관을 경유하여 통감의 인가를 받아야한다. \n\n제3조. 종교의 용도로 제공하기 위하여 사원, 당우, 회당, 설교소 또는 강의소 등을 설립하고자 할 때는 교파 종파의 관리자 또는 전조 (前條)의 포교자는 다음의 사항을 구비하여 그 소재지의 관할이사관의 인가를 받아야한다. \n\n명칭 및 소재지\n\n종교의 명칭\n\n관리 및 유지 방법\n\n\n제4조. 교파 종파의 관리자 또는 제2조의 포교자 그 외 제국신민으로 한국사원의 관리위탁에 응하고자 할 때는 필요한 서류를 첨부하여 그 사원 소재지의 관할이사관을 경유하여 통감의 인가를 받아야 한다. \n\n제5조. 앞의 각 조의 인가 사항을 변경하고자 할 때는 다시 인가를 받아야한다. \n\n제6조. 교파 종파의 관리자 또는 제 2조의 포교자는 소속 포교자의 성명 및 자격을 관할 이사관에게 신고해야 하며 그 포교자에게 변경사항이 발생할 때도 역시 마찬가지이다. \n\n\nThe importance of this regulation lies in two key aspects: 1) categorizing religions within the legal system, and 2) systematizing the registration procedures for Japanese religious organizations, using these as tools for assimilating Korean religions. This regulation was informed by the Japanese government's experience in developing and implementing religious laws following the Meiji Restoration.\n\n\nFirst, this regulation categorized religions into Shintoism (Sect-Shinto), Buddhism, and other religions. This categorization was based on 太政官布達 No. 19 (1884) and Article 28 of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan (日本帝国憲法; 1889). 太政官布達 No. 19 (1884) recognized Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity as official religions, while other religions, including folk and new religions, were classified as pseudo-religions. Confucianism and State Shintoism were recognized as non-religions. Specifically, Confucianism was employed as a moral and ethical philosophy for educating people. Article 28 of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan defined the realm of religious practice as subject to social regulations in Japan, confining religion within the social norms that should not transcend the national ideology of State Shintoism. This concept was transferred to the religious policies in colonial Korea and often conflicted with the missionaries there. \n\n\nSecond, this regulation was designed to control Japanese religions and their missionary work in Korea. Japanese settlements in Korea had been protected by the Resident Community Law (居留民團法) since March 1905. This law was part of Japan’s broader efforts to exert control over Korea, which eventually led to the full annexation in 1910. Through the Resident Community Law, Japan established a legal framework that facilitated colonial administration by organizing Japanese settlers into structured communities with their own internal governance. \n\n\nBased on this law, the main focus of this regulation was on the establishment of religious organizations and the registration system for their workers, including their buildings or places of worship. Japan implemented the Ministry of Home Affairs Ordinance No. 41 (1899: 内務省令第41号) and the regulations concerning the establishment of corporations for the purpose of religious proclamation or conducting religious ceremonies (1900: 宗教宣布又は宗教上儀式執行ヲ目的トスル法人ノ設立等ニ関スル規定) and enforced this control system through laws and regulations. The rules regarding the proclamation of religion (1906) extended these controls to Japanese religions in Korea.\n\n\nAt this point, it is important to understand how many Japanese religious organizations were active in Korea during that time. The following table presents the number of religions and denominations just before the forced annexation agreement in 1910. There were Sect Shintoism (7 denominations), Japanese Buddhism (9 denominations), Japanese Christianity (8 denominations), and Korean Christianity (10 denominations). The total number of mission centers (布教所) for Japanese religions was 159, compared to 2,944 for Korean Christianity.\n\n\n| Religion | Denomination宗團/宗派 | # of Mission centers(Shinto shrine, temple, church) | # of proselytizer(Shinto priest, Monk, and missionary) | Followers | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | NA | Japanese | Korean |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sect.

Statistics of Japanese Religion Propagation Before Forced Annexation (including Korean Christianity, as of 1910)However, about half of the Shintoism followers were Koreans, and more than half of the Japanese Buddhism followers were Koreans, indicating that Japanese religions had begun their missionary work in Korea successfully. These Japanese religious institutions and workers were utilized to integrate Korea's religions into the Japanese Empire as a means of assimilation.\n\n\nOther laws and regulations also had a significant impact on religions in Korea. For instance, the Japanese Resident-General of Korea implemented the Security Regulation in 1906 as part of broader efforts to tighten control over the peninsula. These regulations were designed to suppress any activities or movements that could threaten the stability of Japanese rule. They included measures to monitor and restrict the activities of Korean citizens, particularly those involved in political, religious, or social organizations that were viewed as potential sources of resistance. This regulation empowered Japanese authorities to arrest, detain, and punish individuals deemed to be engaging in subversive activities, thereby further consolidating Japan’s control over Korea. \n\n\nThe Newspaper Law of 1907, followed by the Gwangmu Newspaper Law and the Revised Newspaper Law of 1908, was enacted to tighten control over the press in Korea. These laws were designed to restrict freedom of speech and prevent the spread of anti-Japanese sentiment through newspapers and other publications. The 1907 law was unable to effectively control foreign publishers, such as the Protestant Yeseugyo Sinbo and the Catholic Gyeonghyang Sinmun, as well as the general newspaper Daehan Maeil Sinbo. However, the revised laws of 1908 empowered the Minister of Home Affairs to ban the sale, distribution, and confiscation of newspapers published abroad or by foreigners within Korea if they were deemed to disrupt public order or corrupt public morals. Consequently, these newspapers faced censorship and significant limitations in publishing religious messages that could encourage Christian involvement in the independence movement.\n\n\nThe second part of the law and regulations regarding religion and religious organizations in Korea pertains to private school that were founded by missionaries and Korean religious organizations. In 1899, Japan promulgated the Private School Ordinance. The main components of this ordinance are presented in Table 1 for later comparison with Korea's Private School Ordinance in 1908, as shown in Table 3. \n\n\nTable 3.

Gojong and Queen Min provided protection to missionaries, allowing them to establish connections with missionary organizations in their home countries. This support was evident even during events like the Donghak Rebellion, the Sino-Japan War, and the Russo-Japan War when indigenous people recognized that missionaries and their institutions, including churches, schools, and hospitals, represented a new force for the betterment of their country and families. Notably, the middle and lower social classes, as well as merchants, actively embraced Christianity. The Great Revival and the Million Soul Movement further fueled the expansion of the Protestant church.\n\n\nMoreover, the Protestant church in Korea took a leading role in modernized education, with missionaries eagerly establishing schools. However, from Japan's perspective, this development wasn't entirely favorable because individual missionaries and mission denominations often competed with each other, creating a self-sustaining system that wielded significant social influence. From 1905 to 1910, a number of missionaries doubled and the number of Christians in 1900 was 12,000, and by 1905, it had grown to 26,057. This demonstrated annual growth rates exceeding 100% until 1910. Additionally, Korean Bible was rapidly distributed across the nation by Korean people who were called as Colporteur: Maeseoin 매서인 賣書人 or Gwonseoin 권서인 勸書人. \n\n\nTable 4. Distribution of the Bible and the number of colporteurs  \n\n| Year | Distribution of the Bible | Colporteur | Missionary (including family) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1902 | 28,716 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1903 | 28,335 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1904 | 52,003 | 22 |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1905 | 98,498 | 53 | 193 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1906 | 127,269 | 26 | 202 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1907 | 151,230 | 64 | 211 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1908 | 162,887 | 70 |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1909 | 356,617 | 102 | 301 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1910 | 666,178 | 114 |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1911 | 236,296 | 146 | 349 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1912 | 183,845 | 157 | 423 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1913 | 389,401 | 182 |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nAt the same time period, statistics show that China had the highest number of 380 people, followed by South Korea with 182 people, and then India with 160 people. Bible sales were also significant, with China selling 2,010,434 copies, South Korea selling 311,278 copies, and India selling 310,364 copies. When comparing the total populations of China and India to South Korea, these numbers are remarkable. Such growth of missionary work, especially active participation by Koreans, posed a challenge to colonial rule, as the Japanese governor mentioned earlier. (https://missionews.co.kr/news/583057)\n\n\nThe biggest issue was that neither Korea nor the Japanese colonial government had control over these Christian forces. Japan's approach had two main aspects. First, they conducted internal investigations and surveillance of the Christian influence. In 1908, a survey of the state of Christian proselytization was conducted, aiming to gather statistics on the number of missionaries within the Christian community, the Korean congregation size, and the scale of their activities. However, they approached foreign missionaries very cautiously.\n\n\"When conducting these investigations, officials were directly dispatched to visit foreign missionaries, explaining that they were sent specifically to dispel any groundless rumors, false suspicions, or misunderstandings regarding religious matters, all in accordance with the orders of the central government. They also expressed a desire to thoroughly inquire about the state of proselytization. However, it was unclear whether discussing such matters would create any issues, or if, when conducting actual inspections of churches, preaching stations, schools, hospitals, etc., it would be possible to make a charitable donation of 10 to 20 yen in the name of the government to their charitable activities. This was thought to quickly achieve emotional harmony. I would like to inquire whether a total donation of 50,000 yen would be feasible.\" \n\n\nThis demonstrates Japan's efforts not to create any misunderstandings with foreign missionaries. Subsequently, such investigations and surveillance were also carried out in Christian schools, hospitals, and other social facilities.\n\nIn contrast to the strong desire for independence among Korean Christians, missionaries received instructions from their respective home churches to keep their distance from Korean politics. In 1901, the Korean Protestant Church adopted a policy of non-interference in politics. The colonial government, taking a cue from the Christian control laws that had been promulgated in Japan in 1899, issued several regulations, such as Governor-General's Decree No. 45 in 1906, titled 'Regulations on Missionary Activities,' and Governor-General's Ordinance No. 62 in 1908, regarding private schools. The 'Regulations on Missionary Activities' aimed to restrict the spread of foreign missionaries into the Korean interior and among the common people while encouraging the missionary activities of Japanese missionaries.\n\n\nRather than the 'Regulations on Missionary Activities,' it was the 'Private School Ordinance' that directly exerted control over foreign missionaries before the start of complete colonial rule in 1910. The colonial government recognized the importance of the school system, but its effects would not be fully seen for at least a decade, so Japan hastened to reorganize the education system. Moreover, the Christian community's schools were perceived as bases for independence movements. When looking at the School Ordinance of 1906 (Teacher's School Ordinance, High School Ordinance, Foreign Language School Ordinance, Common School Ordinance), it becomes evident that Japan's educational policy in Korea at that time aimed to educate and legitimize the colonial regime through public schools, with the long-term goal of stability in mind.\n\nTheir sense of crisis is evident in Kumamoto Shigekichi 隈本繁吉s report on the inspection of Christian schools in North Korea. He assessed the situation in Korea as almost equivalent to a \"problem of education versus religion\" and considered it as a \"problem of education versus Christianity.\" In particular, the largest denominations, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church from the United States, were expanding their influence with the support and protection of the U.S. government. He pointed out the following issues related to the \"educational\" aspect, which he considered the driving force behind their activities:\n\nChristian educational institutions currently offer a 13-year curriculum, including elementary, middle, and high school levels, which is more comprehensive than the government's educational system.\n\nThe curriculum includes a significant number of religious subjects, leading to the majority of their students becoming Christian believers.\n\nMany textbooks with politically anti-Japanese content are adopted.\n\nGraduates who have been trained in this manner are actively employed not only within the Christian community but also in various private schools, becoming educators who assist in missionary work and contribute to the hopes of both denominations (Presbyterian and Methodist).\n\n\nTo gradually address the integration of Christian schools into Japan's new regime, early versions of the Private School Ordinance were discussed through negotiations with missionaries. According to Samuel Moffet's report in 1908, the General Council of Protestant Evangelical Missions in Korea had multiple meetings and negotiations with the Japanese government starting in 1907. They sought the understanding of British and American diplomats and held discussions with Commissioner Zennei, the educational authorities, and Mr. Sammons. The committee provided information about the scale and nature of their educational activities and requested that government education regulations be formulated in consideration of their educational activities. They also requested recognition for their schools and graduates on par with government-run schools, provided that their schools reached or exceeded the standards set for government-run schools.\n\n\nFurthermore, the committee made it explicitly clear that Christianity should be taught in all of their schools. They received very courteous treatment, and the meetings were seen as promising a harmonious relationship of mutual understanding between government authorities and missionary organizations in education.\n\nJapan had promised religious freedom but requested that Christian schools adhere to the same standards as public schools. In response, the missionaries stated, \n\nRegarding the curriculum of our schools, we intend to maintain the same standards as public schools. Of course, Christianity will be taught as the foundation of ethics and religion. \n\nWe request that the government consider treating our schools and their graduates on par with public schools and their graduates. We will ensure that our schools are not deemed inferior to public schools. \n\nTo bring our schools in line with government regulations and policies, we wish to obtain information about the regulations and curricula of public schools. We are willing to provide all necessary information about our schools and their policies to the government. \n\nThe Private School Ordinance did not include regulatory provisions concerning religious education, and it allowed private schools to be recognized on equal terms with public schools in terms of staffing and advancement to higher education. However, it should be noted that there were still regulatory provisions, such as the need for approval from the Minister of Education to establish new schools and a requirement for existing schools to obtain approval from the Japanese government within six months. Upon closer examination, it became apparent that certain regulatory provisions were still in place (Table 2). It was only later that the Christian community realized that this was part of the Japanese government's policy of control over Christianity.\n\n\nTable 5.

Moreover, this assurance includes the statement that \"all Christian schools of equal grade with other private schools shall be entitled to the privileges extended to other private schools, by following the laws and regulations related to private schools, such as Ordinance No. 62, Regulations No. 63, Regulations for Subsidies18 to Private Schools No. 14, Regulations for the Inspection of Educational Books No. 16, Regulations for the Sale of Educational Books No. 18, and Notification No. 6, Rules for Private School Students.\" Following this guarantee, missionary organizations began the registration process for their affiliated private schools.\n\n\nWhile missionary organizations agreed to these terms, the reactions of the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches differed. The Methodist Church viewed the agreement as an important historical treaty for the development of education in Korea and responded positively. On the other hand, the Northern Presbyterian Church Mission, while accepting the agreement, maintained a critical attitude, stating, \"The government's attitude toward the management of Christian schools has not yet been clearly defined. However, there appear to be valid reasons to believe that there is no intention to interfere with the specifics of school administration.\"\n\nComparing the Korean Private School Ordinance with the Japanese counterpart from 1899 (Table 3), we can observe several differences in its provisions:\n\nAddition of Articles 2 and 4: Articles 2 and 4 were added to the Korean Private School Ordinance. However, the expressions \"those with improper conduct\" and \"those who disrupt social order\" are ambiguous and leave room for subjective judgment by the Japanese government, making it possible for them to interpret these terms as they see fit.\n\nSupervisory Authority: The entity responsible for supervision differs between Japan and Korea. In Japan, local officials oversee private schools, whereas in Korea, the Minister of Education directly assumes this role. Additionally, the Minister of Education in Korea has the power to review and approve textbooks and exercises command over local officials. Moreover, the authority to prohibit classes is unique to Korea.\n\nAnnual Reporting Requirement: Article 12 stipulates that schools must provide an annual report on their status. Notably, even private schools in Korea are subject to textbook inspections and approvals, while Japanese private schools do not face such interference. This provision regarding textbooks is significant as, in Christian schools, the Bible served as a textbook, making it possible for authorities to potentially ban Bible education at any time.\n\nStringent Conditions for Approval: The conditions for approval and the qualifications for school principals in Korea are more restrictive and specific compared to Japan. This specificity may have been intended to limit the granting of approvals to individuals not favored by the Japanese government.\n\n\nThese differences highlight the Japanese government's intent to exert greater control and influence over education in Korea compared to Japan, particularly in the context of Christian schools and the potential regulation of Bible education.\n\n\nTable 6.

This situation also applied to Christian private schools. As a result, the Japanese colonial government achieved the significant milestone of having control over all schools, including private ones. This was considered the most significant accomplishment. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nJapan's full-scale political interference in Korea began in the late 19th century. The declining Joseon Dynasty tried to preserve its rule by navigating the complex political and diplomatic tensions between neighboring Russia, China, and Japan. Additionally, it sought to build a close relationship with the United States through missionaries. However, the great powers sought to exploit Korea for their own national interests.\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the unequal treaties between Japan and Korea, as well as between Japan and other countries.\n\n\nTable 2. Unequal Treaties Between Korea and Major Powers (1900-1910)\n\n| 02.23.1904.  | Japan-Korea Protocol of 1904 | Japan was able to use Joseon as a military supply base without any obstruction, and Joseon was prohibited from establishing diplomatic relations with any other country without Japan's consent. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 08.22.1904.  | The First Japan-Korea Treaty | It forced the Korean Empire to hire foreign advisors.  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 07.1905 | Taft-Katsura agreement (U.S. -Japan) | The United States recognized Japan's colonial rule over the Philippines, while the United States condoned Japan's invasion of the Korean Empire and its establishment of Korea as a protectorate. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 08.12. 1905 | The second Anglo-Japanese Alliance | Securing diplomatic recognition of Japan’s control over Korea.  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 09.05. 1905 | The treaty of Portsmouth | The original statement: https://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/pw/19050905.T1E.htmlRusso-Japanese War was over.

However, due to conflicts over Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, Russia and Japan severed diplomatic relations and went to war in February 1904. Japan unilaterally formed an alliance based on the premise of mutual defense.It is a treaty that was secretly concluded on February 23, 1904, between Lee Ji-yong, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Korean Empire, and Hayashi Gonsuke, the Japanese Minister to Korea.\n\n\n The original statement: https://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/pw/19040223.T1E.html#:~:text=For%20the%20purpose%20of%20maintaining,regard%20to%20improvements%20in%20administration.\n\n\nARTICLE I. For the purpose of maintaining a permanent and solid friendship between Japan and Corea and firmly establishing peace in the Far East, the Imperial Government of Corea shall place full confidence in the Imperial Government of Japan and adopt the advice of the latter in regard to improvements in administration.\n\nARTICLE II.

The Imperial Government of Japan may, for the attainment of the above-mentioned object, occupy, when the circumstances require it, such places as may be necessary from strategical points of view.\n\nARTICLE V. The Governments of the two countries shall not in future, without mutual consent, conclude with a third Power such an arrangement as may be contrary to the principles of the present Protocol.\n\nARTICLE VI. Details in connection with the present Protocol shall be arranged, as the circumstances may require, between the Representative of Japan and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Corea.\n\n\nThe First Japan-Korea Treaty\n\n\nBackground: It was a treaty concluded during the Russo-Japanese War when the situation was turning in Japan’s favor.  \n\nThe original statement: https://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/pw/19040822.T1E.html\n\n\nThe Second Japan-Korea\n\n\nBackground: Emperor Gojong opposed the treaty that would strip Korea of its diplomatic rights. In response, Japan sent General Ito Hirobumi, who individually asked each of the ministers whether they were for or against the treaty. Emperor Gojong did not attend this meeting. Among the eight ministers present, five voted in favor. Japan surrounded the royal palace and coerced the government ministers into proclaiming the treaty.\n\nThe original statement\n\nhttps://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/pw/19051117.T1E.html\n\nARTICLE I. The Government of Japan, through the Department of Foreign Affairs at Tokyo, will hereafter have control and direction of the external relations and affairs of Corea, and the diplomatic and consular representatives of Japan will have the charge of the subjects and interests of Corea in foreign countries.\n\nARTICLE II. The Government of Japan undertake to see to the execution of the treaties actually existing between Corea and other Powers, and the Government of Corea engage not to conclude hereafter any act or engagement having an international character except through the medium of the Government of Japan.\n\nARTICLE III. The Government of Japan shall be represented at the Court of His Majesty the Emperor of Corea by a Resident General, who shall reside at Seoul, primarily for the purpose of taking charge of and directing matters relating to diplomatic affairs. He shall have the right of private and personal audience of His Majesty the Emperor of Corea. The Japanese Government shall also have the right to station Residents at the several open ports and such other places in Corea as they may deem necessary. Such Residents shall, under the direction of the Resident General, exercise the powers and functions hitherto appertaining to Japanese Consuls in Corea and shall perform such duties as may be necessary in order to carry into full effect the provisions of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE IV. The stipulations of all Treaties and Agreements existing between Japan and Corea, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, shall continue in force.\n\nARTICLE V. The Government of Japan undertake to maintain the welfare and dignity of the Imperial House of Corea. In faith whereof, the Undersigned duly authorized by their Governments have signed this Agreement and affixed their seals.\n\n\nThe third Japan-Korea Treaty \n\n\nBackground: After refusing to sign the Second Japan-Korea Treaty in 1905, Emperor Gojong secretly sent envoys Lee Sang-seol, Lee Jun, and Lee Wi-jong to the Second Hague Peace Conference in June 1907. This was an attempt to inform the world of Japan's unjust invasion of the Korean Empire following the Russo-Japanese War and to seek assistance from the Western powers. Despite the active support of American missionary Homer Hulbert in raising awareness of the invasion through Western media, the Korean envoys were largely ignored by the representatives of the participating nations, leaving the Korean Empire even more isolated. As a result of this incident, Emperor Gojong was dethroned, and a treaty was subsequently signed to further solidify colonial rule.\n\nThe original statement: http://contents.history.go.kr/mobile/hm/view.do?levelId=hm_121_0080\n\n\nArticle 1: The Korean government shall receive guidance from the Resident-General regarding administrative reforms.\n\nArticle 2: The enactment of laws and important administrative measures by the Korean government shall require prior approval from the Resident-General.\n\nArticle 3: Judicial affairs in Korea shall be distinguished from general administrative affairs.\n\nArticle 4: The appointment and dismissal of high-ranking officials in Korea shall be executed with the consent of the Resident-General.\n\nArticle 5: The Korean government shall appoint Japanese nationals recommended by the Resident-General as Korean officials.\n\nArticle 6: The Korean government shall not invite or employ foreigners without the consent of the Resident-General.\n\n\nUntil the signing of the Eulsa Treaty in 1910, as detailed above, Japan gradually stripped the Korean Empire of its authority and, in the process, entered into unequal treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and others. These unequal treaties were initially necessary to justify Japan's colonial rule over Korea, and the Western powers passively allowed Korea's colonization. This is evidenced by the fact that the envoys sent by Emperor Gojong to the Hague were thoroughly ignored by the Western representatives at the Paris Peace Conference. However, these unequal treaties later became obstacles for the Government-General of Korea in controlling foreign missionaries, and the churches, schools, and hospitals they established in Korea. ",
