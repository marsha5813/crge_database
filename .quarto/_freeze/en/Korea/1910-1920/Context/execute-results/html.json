The framework related to the legal system to be applied in Korea was realized through the \"Matters Regarding Laws to Be Applied in Korea\" (Regulation No. 324) and was promulgated as an emergency regulation on August 29, together with \"Matters Regarding the Establishment of the Korean Governor-General.\" Subsequently, on March 25, 1911, Law No. 30, the \"Law Regarding Laws to Be Applied in Korea,\" was promulgated, forming the basis for the legal system in colonial Korea, with regulations and decrees of the Korean Governor-General as its foundation.\n\nThe enactment of Law No. 30 allowed for almost complete control over colonial legislation by the Japanese Cabinet and the Korean Governor-General, with only a few laws that could be formulated by the Japanese parliament specifically for Korea. This laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Korean colonial governance system and the transplantation of colonial legal systems, with little to no obstacles, under a thorough social control framework.\n\n\nVarious characteristic measures of the so-called \"unauthorized governance\" were implemented during this period of Korean colonial policies. These included strict surveillance and oversight based on the Hyeonbyeong (military police) system, the closure of all media outlets except for official government newspapers like Gyeongseong Ilbo and Maeil Shinbo, the dissolution of all political organizations, including the pro-Japanese group Iljinhoe, and the suppression of Korean public opinion and even channels for expressing dissent were strictly prohibited. This characterized the modern legal system in colonial Korea, which left no room for public opinion or avenues of expression.\n\n\nOne of the exceptional areas that remained relatively untouched by these measures was the legal framework related to Christianity.\n\n\"Religious freedom is something recognized by all civilized nations. It is natural for individuals to seek peace and salvation through the religious doctrines they follow. However, if differences in religious sects lead to unnecessary disputes or if religion is used as a pretext for discussing political matters, it is detrimental to morality, disrupts peace, and should be rectified by law. Nevertheless, both Confucianism and Christianity, at their core, aim to improve the hearts and society of people. Therefore, they do not conflict with the goals of governance; instead, they can be beneficial. Thus, there should be no discrimination among various religions, and they should be provided with suitable protection and convenience for their propagation and dissemination.\" \n\n\nHere, religious freedom is mentioned with certain limitations, cautioning against using religion as a pretext for political activities. This was likely a response to the unequal treaties that Christian missionaries and Western powers had negotiated with Korea. The Department of Education took charge of all matters related to education, including religious education, while the Foreign Affairs Bureau (外事局) handled issues concerning foreign treaties, diplomatic missions, and foreigners. During the early 1910s, the administrative tasks related to Christianity under the Governor-General's office primarily revolved around Christian private schools. However, after the promulgation of the Evangelism Regulations in 1915, additional responsibilities were assigned concerning missionary institutions, leading to the establishment of the Internal Affairs Bureau, Section 1. Following the visibility of the persuasion policy towards Christianity after 1919, a Religious Affairs Section was set up within the Bureau of Education. Additionally, it's worth noting that the duties of the High Police Section openly included \"Religious Supervision,\" indicating that during the unauthorized governance period, religious control was an official responsibility of the Hyeonbyeong (Military police).\n\n\nIn the case of Buddhism, through the promulgation of the \"Temple Law\" (Decree No. 7) in June 1911 and the \"Regulations for the Implementation of Temple Regulations\" (Governor-General's Decree No. 84), all temples nationwide were consolidated into a system of 30 main temples. The Japanese authorities not only controlled the authorization for the chief priests of these main temples but also had the authority to permit the sale of temple properties and financial control. They also treated the chief priests of these 30 main temples as equivalent to superintendent-level officials, effectively co-opting them as collaborators in colonial governance.\n\nFor traditional belief systems in Korea, such as Confucianism and Buddhism, their organizational structures were simply absorbed into the colonial administration through the promulgation and enforcement of colonial laws. Confucianism eventually became marginalized as an officially recognized religion due to the 1915 Propagation Regulations 布教規則, which excluded it from being officially sanctioned and made it a mere tool for societal transformation. In the case of Buddhism, while it was recognized as an official religion, the inability to establish new temples during the colonial period meant that it had to maintain its existing institutions without any significant growth.\n\n\nReligious Laws: Propagation Regulations 布教規則 (1915)\n\n\nThe Rules Regarding the Proclamation of Religion was abolished after ten years’ implementation and the Propagation Regulations was implemented in 1915. The original entire statement is below:Article 1: In this ordinance, the term \"religion\" refers to Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity.\n\n\nArticle 2: Those who wish to engage in religious propagation must submit a report to the Governor-General of Korea, attaching documents that prove their qualifications as a propagator, along with a resume. However, those belonging to sects, denominations, or temples in Korea that have a propagation manager may omit the requirements of Clause 2.\n\n\nThe name of the religion and its sect or denomination.\n\nThe key tenets of the doctrine.\n\nThe methods of propagation. When there is any change in the items mentioned in each clause above, it must be reported to the Governor-General of Korea within 10 days.\n\n\nArticle 3: When Shinto, any sect, or any Buddhist sect from the interior (Japan) wishes to engage in propagation, the head of that sect or denomination must appoint a propagation manager and obtain approval from the Governor-General of Korea by submitting the following items:\n\n\nThe name of the religion and its sect or denomination.\n\nThe religious code or sect regulations.\n\nThe methods of propagation.\n\nThe authority of the propagation manager.\n\nThe methods for supervising propagators.\n\nThe location of the propagation management office.\n\nThe name and resume of the propagation manager. When there is any change in the items mentioned in each clause above, approval from the Governor-General of Korea must be obtained.\n\n\nArticle 4: If the Governor-General of Korea deems the methods of propagation, the authority of the propagation manager, the methods of supervising propagators, or the propagation manager himself as inappropriate, he may order changes.\n\n\nArticle 5: The propagation manager must be a resident of Korea. The propagation manager must compile a register of all affiliated propagators as of December 31 each year and report it to the Governor-General of Korea by January 31 of the following year. The register must include the names and residences of the propagators.\n\n\nArticle 6: The Governor-General of Korea may require the appointment of a propagation manager for sects or denominations other than those specified in Article 3 if deemed necessary. When a propagation manager is appointed in accordance with the previous clause, the details of Article 3, Clause 1 must be reported to the Governor-General of Korea within 10 days. The same applies when making changes.\n\n\nArticle 7: For the propagation managers mentioned in the previous article, the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 apply. If a sect or denomination not specified in Article 3 appoints a propagation manager according to its own regulations, the provisions of Articles 4, 5, and the previous article, Clause 2 apply.\n\n\nArticle 8: Those engaged in religious propagation must report to the Governor-General of Korea within 10 days if they change their name, move their residence, or cease propagation.\n\n\nArticle 9: Those who wish to establish a church, preaching station, or lecture hall for religious purposes must obtain approval from the Governor-General of Korea by submitting the following items:\n\n\nThe reason for establishment.\n\nThe name and location\n\nThe area of the land and the floor space of the building, the name of the owner, and the building plan.\n\nThe name of the religion and its sect or denomination.\n\nThe qualifications of the person in charge of propagation and the method of selection.\n\nThe establishment expenses and how they will be covered.\n\nThe methods of management and maintenance. When a person in charge of propagation is appointed according to Clause 5 above, the founder or the propagation manager must report the name and residence of the appointee, along with a resume, to the Governor-General of Korea within 10 days. The same applies when making changes.\n\n\nArticle 10: When there is any change in the items mentioned in Clause 1, Items 2 through 7 of the previous article, the reasons for the change must be reported to the Governor-General of Korea and approval must be obtained.\n\n\nArticle 11: When a church, preaching station, or lecture hall for religious purposes is to be abolished, it must be reported to the Governor-General of Korea within 10 days.\n\n\nArticle 12: Propagation managers and the head priests of temples in Korea must compile and report to the Governor-General of Korea by January 31 of the following year the number of believers and the increase or decrease in the number of believers for the year as of December 31 each year for each affiliated temple, church, preaching station, or lecture hall. In the case of sects, denominations, or churches, preaching stations, or lecture halls that do not have a propagation manager, the report must be submitted by the person in charge of propagation.\n\n\nArticle 13: When a person belonging to a sect or denomination with a propagation manager or to a temple in Korea obtains approval or submits a report according to this ordinance, the seal of the propagation manager or the head priest must be attached.\n\n\nArticle 14: Those who violate Clause 1 or Clause 2 of Article 9 will be subject to a fine or penalty not exceeding 100 yen.\n\n\nArticle 15: The Governor-General of Korea may apply the provisions of this ordinance to organizations recognized as similar to religions if deemed necessary. The organizations to which this ordinance is applied according to the previous clause will be publicly announced.\n\n\nCompared to the 1905 regulation, this regulation extended its realm to Korean Buddhism and Christianity. Thus, Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity were officially confirmed as religions in Korea (Article 1 and 3). Recognizing Christianity as an official religion was influenced by the awareness of the Western countries where the missionaries originated and by the precedent of official religion recognition in Japan. However, it was also due to taxation issues related to Christian schools and churches that had been ongoing since the early 1900s. As a further explanation, the 105-Man Incident from 1910 to 1911 was used to frame Christian nationalist leaders as conspirators in the assassination and threats against the Governor-General of Korea. This allowed the Japanese colonial authorities to suppress Christianity without causing friction with the missionaries' home countries. Additionally, the June 1912 promulgation of the 'Korean Registration Tax Ordinance,' which began taxing church properties, influenced the 1915 revision of the law. Secondly, the system for religious organizations and their workers was changed from an approval system to a notification system, and the procedures were simplified. When submitting a notification, religious personnel, the abolition of facilities, and the annual increase or decrease in the number of believers had to be reported. Additionally, the possibility of recognizing organizations similar to religious groups was suggested, which differs from previous laws. Furthermore, Article 14 specifies that fines will be imposed if essential information is omitted.  \n\n\nA notable point is that religious organizations, facilities, personnel, and the number of believers had to be reported to or approved by the Governor-General. Unlike the Governor-General of Taiwan, who did not report directly to the Emperor and lacked full authority, the Governor-General of Korea was appointed directly by the Emperor and wielded strong control over legislative, judicial, administrative, and military matters, with the Emperor taking full responsibility for his decisions. All eight successive Governors-General of Korea were generals or admirals in the army or navy. This law, which maintained the Governor-General’s strong authority over religion, remained in effect until the end of the colonial period. This stands in contrast to Japan, where the Religious Organizations Law was proposed in 1899 but was only enacted in 1939. The law served as a model for other colonies. For instance, the 1921 Temple and Propagation Regulations in Sakhalin, the August 1931 Propagation Regulations in the South Sea Islands including Saipan and Guam, and the 1938 Propagation Regulations in Manchukuo, which extended to Taoism, were all influenced by this law.\n\n\nEducation Law: The Education Ordinance (1911) and The Private School Regulations (1915) \n\nThe promised religious freedom in colonial Korea was based on the premise of such control. Except for adherents and sectarians, Christianity, with its connections to Western powers, was the only exception within this framework. When formal colonial rule was established in 1910, the Japanese Governor-General's Office in Korea actively pursued a legal framework for land projects, company regulations, and mining development to exploit Korea. However, they approached the education system with caution. In 1911, the Korean Education Ordinance (August 23, 1911, Imperial Ordinance No. 229) was promulgated, which laid the foundation for the Korean education system. This framework included the Korean Education Ordinance, established as an Imperial Ordinance by the Emperor, and beneath it, various school regulations for ordinary schools, high schools, vocational schools, and others were formulated in the form of regulations issued by the Korean Governor-General's Office. The Private School Regulations, promulgated as Korean Governor-General's Office Ordinance No. 114 on October 20, 1911, were also included within this hierarchy.\n\n\nIn contrast to Japan, where education-related regulations were established as separate ordinances, such as elementary school regulations, middle school regulations, and imperial university regulations, all education-related legal provisions in Japan transitioned to the form of ordinances based on the Emperor's authority. However, in Korea, the school regulations that had existed in the form of ordinances during the period of the General Government were restructured into a hierarchical order, with the Korean Education Ordinance serving as the superior law.\n\n\nTable 1.

The authorization powers that were once held by the Minister of Education, such as the approval authority and the authority to issue school closure orders, were transferred to the Korean Governor-General's Office. Overall, the oversight and control authority of local officials and the Governor-General were strengthened in the 1911 Private School Regulations. However, there were no new provisions added regarding religious education. Instead, Article 7 of the 1906 \"Ordinance for Ordinary Schools\" was deleted in the 1911 \"Regulations for Ordinary Schools\" (October 20, 1911, Korean Governor-General's Office Ordinance No. 110), which had previously allowed for the modification of designated subjects if approval from the competent authorities was obtained. This meant that the possibility of teaching religion in regular private ordinary schools, once granted official approval, was eliminated. Furthermore, during the General Government era, the separation of religion and education in regular schools, previously mentioned only in internal guidelines, was publicly proclaimed.\n\nAs a result, private schools that remained independent had the freedom to offer religious education. However, it became clear that in order to be incorporated into regular schools, they would have to abandon this practice. The goal of missionaries, who had aimed to eventually achieve the same level of advantages as public schools in terms of curriculum and textbooks standardization, thereby securing equal opportunities for their students in terms of further education or employment, seemed to be drifting further away.\n\n\nIn this situation, the response from the Christian community, primarily led by missionaries, was to align with the government's policies and gradually bring their schools in line with the standards of public schools while seeking to secure freedom for religious education within that framework. H.G. Underwood established the Educational Information Bureau within the Mission Council and subsequently founded the Educational Foundation Committee, a joint organization of mission societies. Missionaries initially accepted guarantees related to their missionary activities upon merging and sought to develop their educational programs in the changing environment through continued dialogue with the authorities. Furthermore, government regulation of private schools was not limited to this; the revised Private School Regulations of 1915 were on the horizon.\n\n\nMarch 24, Taisho 4 (1915)\n\n\nGovernor-General of Korea, Count Terauchi Masatake\n\n\nArticle 3: When a private school intends to change the matters listed in Item 1, Item 2, or Item 3 of the previous article, or the founder, it must obtain approval from the Governor-General of Korea. When intending to change the principal or teachers, approval from the provincial governor is required, and when changing the matters listed in Item 4 or Item 6, the change must be reported to the Governor-General of Korea. However, when changing the founder, principal, or teachers, a resume must be attached.\n\n\nArticle 3-2: The founder of a private school offering specialized education must be a legal entity with sufficient assets to establish and maintain the school.\n\n\nArticle 6-2: The curriculum of a private school that offers general education, vocational education, or specialized education but is not an ordinary school, higher ordinary school, girls' higher ordinary school, vocational school, or specialized school must be determined in accordance with the regulations for ordinary schools, higher ordinary schools, girls' higher ordinary schools, vocational schools, or specialized schools. In such cases, no additional subjects outside of those specified in these regulations may be added.\n\n\nArticle 10-2: Teachers at private schools that offer general education, vocational education, or specialized education must be proficient in the national language (Japanese) and possess academic qualifications corresponding to the level of the school. However, for private schools providing elementary general education, only those who have passed a designated examination, hold a teaching license, or have graduated from a school designated by the Governor-General of Korea may be teachers. The provisions of this article do not apply to those who exclusively teach foreign languages, Korean, classical Chinese, or specialized skills.\n\n\nArticle 16: The principal of a private school must report to the Governor-General of Korea by the end of the following month on the staff list and their subjects, the number of students enrolled and attending by grade, the status of graduates, the distribution of textbooks, and the financial situation as of the end of May each year.\n\n\nSupplementary Provisions\n\n\nThis ordinance shall come into effect on April 1, Taisho 4 (1915). However, teachers at private schools providing elementary general education, or teachers at private schools offering higher ordinary education, vocational education, or specialized education who teach subjects other than moral education, the national language, history, geography, or physical education, may be exempt from the provisions of Article 10-2 until March 31, Taisho 9 (1920). Private schools currently existing with approval at the time of this ordinance's enactment may be exempt from the provisions of Article 3-2, Article 6-2, and Article 10-2 until March 31, Taisho 14 (1925).\n\n\nChurch’s Effort to Establish the Cooperation\n\nAs previously explained, missionaries managed not only their own properties but also various church assets. In October 1906, the \"Land and Building Certification Rules\" (Imperial Ordinance No. 65) and in November, the \"Detailed Rules for the Enforcement of the Land and Building Certification Rules\" (Ministry of Justice Ordinance No. 4) were promulgated, opening the door for foreigners to own land. Starting in March 1910, a land survey project began, and on March 18, 1912, along with the \"Korean Civil Law\" (Imperial Ordinance No. 7), the \"Korean Real Estate Registration Law\" (Imperial Ordinance No. 9) was also promulgated, thus legalizing the registration-related system.\n\n\nBefore the merger, real estate that had been registered with various foreign consulates was registered in almost every possible manner during the tumultuous period of land surveys following the merger. In such a situation, Christian organizations recognized the need to resolve ownership issues and secure stability through incorporation. One significant development was the opening of a provision for legal incorporation of religious organizations through the promulgation of the Korean Civil Law on March 18, 1912 (effective April 1). This was embraced not only by the Catholic Church but also by Protestant denominations. The focus was on securing stability rather than independence from legal control, as it was deemed essential for denominational existence. Moreover, the contemporary situation made this issue an urgent priority.\n\n\nThe incorporation system was seen as advantageous both legally and financially for denominations. Instead of individually registering properties in the names of individuals, establishing corporations to oversee registrations was not only procedurally efficient but also economically beneficial. This was especially significant with the promulgation of the \"Korean Registration Tax Law\" on March 22, 1912 (effective April 1, Ministry of Justice Ordinance No. 16), as it introduced taxes related to property registration. In many cases, properties that were initially registered under individual names but later recognized as corporate entities faced the burden of duplicate registration taxes. Waiting for incorporation while abstaining from registration posed the risk of uncertain ownership, especially concerning land survey projects. The best approach was to quickly gain recognition as a corporation and complete property registrations accordingly.\n\nThe period leading up to 1915, prior to the enactment of the Propagation Regulations, can be seen as a preparatory phase in the establishment of a comprehensive Christian regulatory framework. The first set of Christian regulatory laws introduced in Japan in 1899 marked the beginning of control over education, a central aspect of Christian activities. The 1911 Private School Regulations went beyond the control seen during the era of the General Government by granting religious freedom exclusively to various private schools. However, this was laying the groundwork for even more extensive control.\n\n\nUnlike the era of the General Government, the Private School Regulations incorporated into the Korean Education Law placed private schools under a system that regarded educational principles as the highest ideal of colonial education. This positioning allowed the Governor-General to exercise discretion over various private schools. Based on this foundation, the revised Private School Regulations of 1915 came into existence.\n\n\nIn parallel, laws concerning the incorporation of Christian organizations were introduced alongside the Korean Civil Law. Despite facing government control, the Christian community sought to secure their legal status and property rights through incorporation. However, they faced ongoing setbacks. Just as the Internal Affairs Ordinance No. 39 of 1900 in Japan related to the establishment of corporations for the proclamation of religion or religious ceremonies existed only in theory, the Korean Governor-General's Ordinance No. 71 in the 1910s can also be seen as virtually non-existent concerning Korean Christian organizations. Due to various excuses, efforts to establish corporations were repeatedly rejected, eventually coming to a halt after 1915.\n\nLastly, the control over missionary institutions during this period can initially be traced back to the \"Rules on the Propagation of Religion\" during the era of the General Government. However, these regulations were not specifically aimed at Korean Christian missionary institutions. The emergence of regulatory laws targeting Christian missionary institutions was awaiting the resolution of unequal treaty issues. With the resolution of the Exterritoriality issue in 1914, the appearance of the Evangelism Regulations and the revised Private School Regulations marked a significant turning point for the Christian community. The issue of incorporation, which seemed impossible, was temporarily set aside, and efforts focused on adapting to these newly promulgated laws. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nAs I stated in the agency questionnaire, Christianity was reborn as the primary religion, evolving from a foreign faith, particularly during the March 1st Movement, and through its active involvement in the independence movement of this era. No social hostility towards Christianity was found in the literature. However, Koreanized Christianity began to emerge as a self-reliance movement, countering the negative impacts of missionary control over churches and related mission activities, such as schools and medical centers. The leaders of this movement included Choi Tae-yong, Choi Jung-jin, Kim In-seo, and Pastor Kim Kyo-shin. Later, influenced by Uchimura Kanzō, Kim Kyo-shin led the Korean non-church movement. This movement will be further discussed in the context of its intensification in the 1920s. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nAs this period marked the full-scale intensification of Japanese colonial rule, Korea did not have its own government, making diplomatic relations impossible to discuss. Influenced by the principle of national self-determination, independence movements centered around Christianity and Cheondogyo arose. Although individual missionaries assisted in Korea's independence efforts, Christian nations did not step forward to support Korea's independence. However, the March 1st Movement of 1919 led to the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai (April 11, 1919). From the 1920s onward, the relationships between the Shanghai Provisional Government, neighboring countries, and major powers must be examined. ",
