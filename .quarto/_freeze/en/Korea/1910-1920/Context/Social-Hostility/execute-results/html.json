No social hostility towards Christianity was found in the literature. However, Koreanized Christianity began to emerge as a self-reliance movement, countering the negative impacts of missionary control over churches and related mission activities, such as schools and medical centers. The leaders of this movement included Choi Tae-yong, Choi Jung-jin, Kim In-seo, and Pastor Kim Kyo-shin. Later, influenced by Uchimura Kanz≈ç, Kim Kyo-shin led the Korean non-church movement. This movement will be further discussed in the context of its intensification in the 1920s.  ",
