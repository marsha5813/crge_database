This decision marked a clear departure from earlier efforts aimed at ministering to Korean diaspora communities or remote domestic regions. Prior to this, most missionary activity had targeted culturally homogeneous groups. For example, in 1907, Rev. Lee Ki-Poong was dispatched to Jeju Island following the formation of the Korean Presbytery, a move motivated by the desire to evangelize an unreached area within Korea. Similarly, Choi Kwan-Hol was sent to Vladivostok in 1909, and Han Seok-Jin to Japan, both to minister to Korean immigrants residing there. However, the missionaries sent to China in 1913—Park Tae-Ro, Kim Young-Hoon, and Sa Byung-Soon—were trained to preach in Chinese and were tasked with evangelizing to Chinese nationals. Han-Sung Kim identifies them as the first genuinely cross-cultural missionaries in Korean church history: “The missionaries dispatched in 1912 were the first Korean missionaries with the calling to evangelize Chinese people in their language”.\n\nThis decision, radical for its time, marked a critical transformation of the Korean church from a passive recipient of Western missionary efforts to an active participant in global mission. This took place just 30 years after Suh Sang-Ryun was baptized by John Ross in Manchuria in 1883 and returned to Korea to share the gospel, and less than 30 years after the arrival of Horace G. Underwood and Henry G. Appenzeller in 1885. Despite the brief history of Protestantism in Korea, the church demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to cross-cultural missions. This period, lasting from 1912 to 1955, is thus classified as the formative or preparatory phase of Korean cross-cultural missions. Even during national crises such as Japanese colonial rule (1910–1945) and the Korean War (1950–1953), the flame of Korean missions was never fully extinguished.\n\nFollowing the devastation of the Korean War, the Korean church rekindled its missionary zeal. In 1955, Rev. Choi Chan-Young became the first missionary dispatched after the war, sent to the Philippines. He left behind a war-torn homeland to devote himself to gospel ministry and church planting in Manila. While the number of missionaries remained small throughout the 1950s to the late 1970s, churches and missionary organizations gradually began to develop sending structures and training programs. Han-Sung Kim refers to this period as the \"pioneering phase\" and notes that it “is summarized as the mission work of a small number of missionaries focused on Asia”. These early missionary efforts largely targeted nearby regions such as Southeast Asia, Japan, and Taiwan, and were still lacking in strategic maturity and field experience.\n\nA clear leap forward began to take shape in the late 1970s. A pivotal turning point was the 1973 Billy Graham Crusade held at Yeouido Plaza in Seoul, where over one million people gathered. Graham emphasized repentance and the urgency of evangelism, embedding within Koreans the dual vision of national and global evangelization. Jang Yun Cho describes this moment as follows: “The Billy Graham evangelistic crusade held in Seoul, Korea, in 1973, pulled the trigger for both the modern Korean missions movement and the evangelical movement”. In 1974, the Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (KCCC) hosted EXPLO '74, a mass evangelistic conference that drew a record-setting 2.7 million people in a single gathering—then the largest in Christian history. This event inspired thousands of young Koreans to embrace a vision for world missions. Cho notes, “These two mass evangelistic conferences made a great impact on Korean believers for both national evangelization and world missions”.\n\nFollowing these events, Korean mission agencies either emerged or significantly strengthened their infrastructure. Organizations such as the Global Missionary Fellowship (GMF), Global Mission Pioneers (GMP), Global Bible Translators (GBT), Korean Presbyterian Mission (KPM), and Helping Overseas Professional’s Employment (HOPE) developed during this preparatory phase for the global expansion of Korean missions. Notably, evangelical campus ministries like CCC, UBF, and IVF began forming pipelines for missionary recruitment, laying the groundwork for the Mission Korea movement that would formally launch in 1988.\n\nThus, the period from 1955 to 1989 represents a transitional phase, from small-scale, hardship-driven efforts to a more structured and expansive leap forward. The Korean church came to see missions not just as a noble calling, but as a necessary outcome of church revival and growth—a conviction that formed the foundation for its emerging identity as a sending church.\n\nThe overseas missions movement of the Korean church in the 1990s must be understood as the culmination of a series of theological, historical, and institutional developments that began decades earlier. Its roots can be traced to 1912, when the Korean Presbyterian Church, commemorating the establishment of its General Assembly, decided to send its first cross-cultural missionaries to Shandong, China. Unlike earlier missionaries such as Yi Ki-pung (Jeju Island, 1907), Choi Gwan-hol (Vladivostok, 1909), and Han Seok-jin (Japan, 1909), who served within the Korean diaspora, the 1913 missionaries were charged with the unprecedented task of evangelizing Chinese people in their own language and cultural setting. This decision came barely thirty years after Protestant Christianity first entered Korea, and it marked the beginning of Korea’s cross-cultural missions history, revealing a remarkable ecclesial boldness for such a young church. As Kim Hansung notes, “Although Korean Protestantism had only just begun to take root, it launched a full-scale foreign missions effort—a movement unparalleled among non-Western churches of the time”.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Korea’s missionary movement remained modest in scale. However, the post-Korean War years saw the emergence of a new missionary consciousness. The 1950s to 1970s, often labeled the “pioneering phase,” were characterized by the sending of small numbers of missionaries, mostly within Asia. The missionary count remained limited: by 1972, Korean churches had dispatched only 33 missionaries abroad. But things began to change dramatically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The turning point, many agree, was the 1973 Billy Graham Crusade in Seoul, which mobilized mass audiences and reinvigorated the evangelical impulse in Korean Christianity. According to Cho Jang Yun, this crusade, followed by the 1974 Explo '74 organized by Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC), “triggered not only a national revival movement but also a new missionary vision among evangelical Christians”.\n\nIt was during this period that the foundational ideas and structures of the modern Korean missions movement were laid. By 1986, the number of missionaries had risen to 511, although 75% were still ministering primarily to Korean populations abroad. The movement was still in a preparatory phase—what Cho calls a “teenage stage”. The real explosion came in the 1990s.\n\nOne of the most decisive events in launching this explosion was the founding of Mission Korea in 1988. Mission Korea was a nationwide interdenominational missions conference that brought together a wide coalition of student ministries, including IVF, CCC, UBF, YWAM Korea, JOY, and others. Held biennially, the first Mission Korea conference marked a symbolic and organizational milestone in Korean missions. The 1990 conference was particularly pivotal. As Cho recounts from personal experience, “On the final night, during George Verwer’s challenge for overseas missions, over 2,000 students stood up to dedicate their lives to mission work. I was among them”. This moment captures how Mission Korea served as the Korean version of the Student Volunteer Movement—a movement that deeply inspired early American missionaries to Korea. The Korean slogan “World Evangelization in Our Generation” was consciously modeled after that of the SVM.\n\nStatistically, the growth in missionary numbers during the 1990s was unprecedented. In 1994, there were 3,272 Korean missionaries serving in various countries. By 1996, that number had risen to 4,202. In 1998, it reached 5,948. This meant that in just one-decade, Korean overseas missions had more than doubled, positioning Korea as the world’s second-largest missionary-sending country after the United States.\n\nThis explosion was the product of several converging factors. The first was church growth. The 1980s had seen Korean Protestantism surpass ten million adherents. Churches had not only grown in number and size, but in financial capacity and strategic vision. “Mission,” in many congregations, came to be seen as the natural sequel to revival. As Cho observes, “There was a communal imagination that the fruit of revival must be missions”.\n\nSecond, Korea’s economic development provided the material base for mission expansion. The post-Olympics boom and the rise of a stable middle class allowed churches and individuals to support long-term missionaries. Self-funded or bi-vocational missionaries became common, and local churches increasingly took on the financial and logistical burdens of sending and supporting missionaries.\n\nThird, the missionary movement became a popularized movement—a movement of the whole church. It was no longer limited to pastors or elites. Evangelical theology emphasized that every believer was a missionary, and this belief translated into concrete mobilization: conferences, youth camps, church seminars, and family mission trips became regular features of church life throughout the 1990s.\n\nKorean missionary efforts also matured theologically and strategically during this period. Theologically, the movement was grounded in a robust evangelical framework. The authority of Scripture, the uniqueness of Christ, and the universality of the Great Commission formed the non-negotiable core. But this foundation also gave rise to new theological emphases, including the missio Dei, incarnational mission, and contextualization. Cho notes that, “Korean missions theology developed from a simple proclamation model to one that includes cultural understanding, social engagement, and cross-cultural discipleship”.\n\nStrategically, the movement diversified its methods. The 10/40 Window became a widely adopted framework, drawing attention to the vast, unreached populations in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Korean missionaries began entering “creative access” nations, often under the guise of professionals—teachers, engineers, doctors, and nurses—who could work and witness without official missionary visas. The business-as-mission (BAM) model also gained traction, as Korean entrepreneurs used their businesses to gain access to closed countries and create platforms for evangelism and discipleship.\n\nMeanwhile, the structure of missionary sending also diversified. Denominational mission boards, such as those of the Hapdong, Tonghap, and Koshin Presbyterian Churches, played a central role in long-term pastoral training and traditional church planting missions. But interdenominational agencies like GMP (Global Mission Pioneers), GMF (Global Missionary Fellowship), and GBT (Global Bible Translators) provided a flexible, lay-oriented path for teachers, women, and non-clergy to enter the field. Additionally, megachurches such as Yoido Full Gospel Church and Onnuri Church began to form their own in-house mission departments, bypassing both denominational and parachurch structures. These churches offered comprehensive systems of missionary training, funding, field support, and accountability. This “church-based mission” model allowed for a more agile and contextually responsive approach to global missions.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, the Korean church had fully transitioned from being a mission field to becoming a mission force. The missionary movement had become embedded not only in institutional structures, but in the spiritual imagination of the Korean evangelical public. As Cho concludes, “This movement has changed the agenda and atmosphere of the Korean church. It has had a great impact on the lives of Christians and on Korean society”.\n\n\nNorth Korean Mission Movement\n\n\nThe surge of North Korean mission efforts in the 1990s was a comprehensive missionary movement, catalyzed by the collapse of the Cold War system and the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation. Korean churches and missionary organizations astutely responded to changes in international politics and internal North Korean dynamics by launching diverse missionary strategies, and in this process, various specific events played crucial roles in materializing the missionary boom.\n\nFirst, the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement was signed in 1991, and in the same year, a symposium was held in Los Angeles involving scholars from North and South Korean churches. In July, the Peaceful Unification Mission Christian Conference convened in Tokyo, Japan, and in October, the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace (ACRP) was held in Kathmandu, Nepal, thereby formally beginning religious exchanges between North and South. These international encounters did not merely symbolize reconciliation but decisively propelled the Korean church to embrace North Korean mission as a tangible task.\n\nAnother pivotal moment occurred with the North Korean famine (Arduous March) and the subsequent international emergency food aid request in 1995. North Korea officially acknowledged its food crisis in February 1995 and requested 300,000 tons of aid from international NGOs, later extending urgent requests to South Korea and Japan in May of the same year. As a result, Korean churches and Christian NGOs, both conservative and progressive, launched large-scale humanitarian assistance, promoting a new form of mission that combined \"gospel and bread.\" Heo Seong-eop noted that \"North Korean missions shifted toward a stage where humanitarian relief and gospel evangelism were integrated as dual strategies.\"\n\nDuring this period, churches and missionary organizations actively diversified their methods for North Korean missions. A particularly notable development was the diversification of missionary strategies and the institutionalization of the identity of 'North Korean missionary.' Notably, the Korean Christian Federation’s Unification Mission College established a specialized program for training North Korean missionaries from the mid-1990s. This program was open to youths, university students, seminarians, laypeople, and pastors, operating on a two-semester system combining theoretical education and field training. Classes were held weekly on Monday evenings, with correspondence courses offered to overcome regional limitations. Lecturers included professors from Seoul National University, former deputy ministers of unification, senior pastors, and think tank researchers, providing a comprehensive education covering politics, economy, society, culture, and mission strategies. Graduates were awarded 'Korean Christian Federation Certified North Korean Missionary' qualifications and were officially commissioned, marking \"a critical turning point in advancing North Korean mission from emotional zeal to systematic and institutionalized missionary movements.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the Cornerstone Mission Society operated a five-stage North Korean Missionary Training School based in border regions with North Korea. This program had detailed step-by-step goals:\n\nThe first stage involved preparing returnees to North Korea for gospel ministry. The second stage focused on intensive Bible education for North Korean defectors. The third stage trained selected leaders through underground seminary programs. The fourth stage supported those needing to settle in China with pastoral care and leadership development. The fifth stage assisted those who could neither return to North Korea nor settle in China in migrating to third countries. Through this system, the ministry established a unique and strategic model for training North Korean defectors as missionaries.\n\nThus, by the late 1990s, the term \"North Korean missionary\" had become more than a symbolic concept; it evolved into a tangible professional and missional identity, encompassing institutional training, organized commissioning, and denominational support systems. Since direct entry into North Korea was impossible, missionaries operated mainly in third countries (China, Russia, Mongolia, etc.), engaging in ministries such as evangelism among North Korean defectors, supporting underground churches near borders, broadcasting Christian radio programs into North Korea, and smuggling Bibles and evangelistic materials.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions existed between the evangelical and ecumenical camps. The evangelical side emphasized underground church work and direct evangelism through defectors, while the ecumenical side pursued peace and reconciliation missions through exchanges with the Korean Christian Federation (Jogeoryeon). For example, in 1995, the Korean National Council of Churches (KNCC) issued the \"Jubilee Declaration for National Unification,\" advocating autonomous unification of the Korean Peninsula, confession of church culpability, and active peace and unification movements. This sparked intense discussions within Korean churches regarding the relationship between reunification and North Korean missions.\n\nIn the late 1990s, North Korea’s Korean Christian Federation (Jogeoryeon) actively sought exchanges with South Korean churches and overseas Christian organizations, leading to the formalization of mission channels. Not only humanitarian support through the Korean Red Cross but also diverse contacts via private missionary organizations increased.\n\nUltimately, the surge of North Korean mission in the 1990s was not merely a fleeting emotional enthusiasm but rather a complex phenomenon driven by political shifts (Inter-Korean Basic Agreement, Kim Il-sung’s death, famine crisis), religious changes (partial relaxation of North Korea’s religious policies), missionary strategy evolution (indirect missions, third-country missions), and internal theological tensions and convergence within Korean Christianity. Heo Seong-eop emphasized that \"North Korean missions must not simply be driven by doctrinal zeal, but must emerge through theological reflection on historical contexts and a deep sense of national responsibility.\"\n\n\nImmigrant Mission\n\n\nImmigrant mission in Korea emerged as a new field of ministry in response to the increasing influx of foreign laborers and marriage migrants. Whereas Korean churches had previously concentrated on centrifugal mission—sending missionaries abroad—this period marked the beginning of centripetal mission, wherein foreigners within Korea became direct subjects of ministry. This shift was not merely strategic but demanded theological reflection on the church’s identity and the essence of mission within a multicultural society.\n\nThe migrant mission effort was prompted by the introduction of the foreign industrial trainee system in 1991, which brought a rapid increase in foreign laborers. These laborers often lacked legal protections and worked under poor conditions in 3D industries (dirty, difficult, and dangerous), facing linguistic, legal, and cultural barriers. By the mid-1990s, undocumented laborers far outnumbered legal workers; in 1994 alone, of the total 81,824 foreign laborers in Korea, 48,231—approximately 59%—were undocumented.\n\nChurches, especially those rooted in industrial mission, responded to this growing reality. Congregations in areas such as Guro, Ansan, and Incheon—industrial hubs—launched holistic ministries that provided shelter, medical assistance, legal aid, Korean language classes, and bilingual worship services. For instance, Seonbu First Church in Ansan and several churches in the Guro industrial zone opened shelters and partnered with pro bono medical teams and legal counselors to support undocumented workers. In Incheon, Hanmaeum Church began holding multilingual worship services in 1997 and worked to build an inclusive faith community for foreign workers.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK, Tonghap) played a leading institutional role in organizing these efforts. During the 1990s, the General Assembly’s Evangelism Department formally recognized migrant ministry as a central mission field and laid groundwork for multicultural ministry. Following a structural reorganization, the Domestic Mission Department took over and expanded efforts via ecumenical partnerships and global mission networks. Notably, from 1998, the PCK invited pastors from the Philippines, Nepal, and Bangladesh to serve as migrant ministry partners in Korea. These invited missionaries led ethnic-language worship services and provided pastoral care, language interpretation, and legal guidance.\n\nAround the same time, churches also began responding to the needs of marriage migrants and multicultural families. Many foreign women who entered Korea through international marriage experienced isolation, cultural conflict, and social discrimination. Churches offered Korean language classes, cultural adaptation programs, and family support ministries. For example, Onyang First Church in Asan launched free Korean classes and Bible instruction for Vietnamese wives in 1999. In Busan, a local church ran “Multicultural Bible Camps” to support parent–child bonding and identity formation.\n\nThrough these developments, migrant mission came to be understood not merely as an alternative mission strategy, but as mission in its own right. It offered a low-cost yet impactful way to expand God’s Kingdom among the nations living within Korea’s borders. Theologically, it called Korean churches to remember their own pilgrim identity: Christians, as described in the New Testament, are “sojourners and exiles” on this earth (παρεπίδημοι). Thus, welcoming migrants as co-citizens of the Kingdom of God became a core dimension of ecclesial faithfulness.\n\nNevertheless, not all church responses were ideal. Some large churches utilized migrant worship services primarily to expand church size or collect offerings, relegating migrant worship to off-hour slots or non-sanctuary spaces. Others continued to treat migrants as passive targets of evangelism, rather than full members of the body of Christ.\n\nDespite these limitations, the 1990s marked a critical turning point as Korean churches began to reckon with their responsibility within a multicultural society. The vision of “reverse mission”—where migrants received the gospel in Korea and returned to evangelize their home countries—also emerged during this period. Migrant mission in the 1990s thus not only opened new possibilities for mission strategy but prompted Korean churches to reevaluate their identity and global calling in the changing world.\n\n\nChanges in Korean Christian Civil Movements\n\n\nFrom the late 1980s, South Korean society underwent dramatic democratic transformations, and Korean Christianity, too, entered a new phase of social engagement. The June Struggle of 1987 broke open the authoritarian regime, resulting in constitutional reform and the introduction of direct presidential elections. In this context, Korean churches began to transition from the radical protest style of minjung (people's) movements toward more diverse and institutional modes of social involvement.\n\nUp until the mid-1980s, social participation by Korean churches largely aligned with the minjung movement, rooted in minjung theology and direct resistance to military dictatorship. However, in the late 1980s, the landscape of social activism began to change. As the authoritarian state weakened and civic spaces expanded, resistance-based movements gave way to civil movements seeking reform within the system. The thesis notes that during this period, “the era of minjung movements was declared to be over, and the era of civil movements was said to have arrived”.\n\nIt was in this historical shift that the Christian Ethics Movement of Korea (CEMK, or 기윤실) was founded in 1987. Led by respected Christian leaders such as Jang Gi-ryeo, Sohn Bong-ho, and Lee Man-yeol, CEMK emphasized ethical self-reflection and personal moral responsibility. The organization believed that “Christians must change society by first embodying moral integrity in their personal lives”. This vision differed from previous protest-based activism and aimed for reform through integrity, service, and public witness. It marked a significant redefinition of Christian civil activism in Korea. CEMK promoted values such as simplicity, honesty, rejection of corruption and bribery, ethical behavior in the workplace, and advocacy for the marginalized. In its guidelines, the group called on Christians to actively pursue economic justice, care for vulnerable populations, and fight against societal corruption. Their approach to civic engagement was intentionally apolitical yet committed to transformative public witness grounded in evangelical values. Meanwhile, from the late 1980s into the early 1990s, another stream of Christian activism emerged—institutional political participation. Unlike in the earlier dictatorship period, some Christian leaders now considered running for public office or engaging in policymaking. This shift sparked internal debate. Many feared that too much political involvement would compromise the church's spiritual integrity and damage the public perception of Christianity. The question was not merely whether to engage politics, but how to do so while remaining faithful to the Gospel.\n\nWhat defined this period, then, was a shift in both goals and methods. While earlier movements focused on resisting state repression, the post-1987 Christian civil movements began grappling with more complex, systemic issues: corruption, inequality, and social polarization. As the thesis argues, “as social movements shifted from resistance to institutional reform, Christian civil movements also began to explore new directions”.\n\nDespite democratization and the expansion of civil society, internal tensions persisted within Korean churches. Some conservative denominations remained skeptical of civil engagement, viewing it as a secular compromise. Yet the evangelical reformist stream, represented by groups like CEMK, continued to gain traction. This tension pushed Christian civil movements to mature, seeking not only moral clarity but also strategic effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, the period from the late 1980s to the 1990s marked a crucial transition in Korean Christian civil activism. It was characterized by(1) a shift from resistance-based minjung activism to civil reformism,(2) the rise of ethical civic engagement based on personal integrity,(3) increasing attempts at institutional political participation, and(4) internal struggles over the proper role of Christianity in public life.\n\nThis period can be understood as a time of strategic and theological reorientation, as the Korean church sought to embody its calling to be salt and light in a changing democratic society.\n\n\nTable. Changes in Korean Christian Civil Movements\n\n\n| Period | Social Context | Characteristics of Christian Civil Movements | Key Examples and Activities |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Late 1980s | Democratization process, decline of authoritarian regime, end of minjung movement | Shift from radical resistance to civil reform; emphasis on ethical witness and civic participation | Expansion of civic movements; Christian intellectuals' active participation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990s | Growth of institutional democracy and civil society | Rise of evangelical-based civic reform; focus on personal morality and structural reform without direct political affiliation | Founding of CEMK (1987); economic justice campaigns; protection of the vulnerable |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n“It is My Fault” (Nae Tasi-o 내 탓이오) Movement\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the “It Is My Fault” (Nae Tasi-o, 내 탓이오) movement launched by the Korean Catholic Church emerged as a movement of self-reflective social participation amidst the broader moral crisis and rising individualism in Korean society. This movement should not be understood as merely a religious slogan but as a serious response to the widespread social conflicts and collapse of ethics that followed democratization. Since the mid-1980s, South Korea had experienced growing regional divisions, labor disputes, and corruption scandals, during which a culture of shifting blame onto others became pervasive. It was within this context that the Catholic Lay Apostolate Council (평신도사도직협의회, hereafter referred to as the Lay Council) realized the urgent need to encourage individuals to take responsibility for the problems of society themselves.\n\nThe immediate inception of the \"It Is My Fault\" movement came in 1988 when the Lay Council proposed a \"Trust Restoration Campaign\" during the annual Catholic Laity Day. They selected the phrase \"It is my fault, my great fault\" from the traditional penitential prayer in the Catholic Mass to symbolize the attitude of personal accountability rather than blaming external forces. Initially, however, the campaign received little public attention. The decisive turning point occurred in 1989, when then-Archbishop Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan attached a \"It Is My Fault\" sticker to the rear window of his personal car. Cardinal Kim declared, \"Only when we reflect on ourselves first can we find solutions,\" thus awakening the national consciousness toward the need for humility and self-reflection.\n\nFollowing this event, the campaign spread rapidly across the nation. The Lay Council produced more than 300,000 \"It Is My Fault\" car stickers, distributing them throughout churches and public venues, and by the early 1990s, vehicles bearing the sticker became a common sight in the streets of South Korea. The public resonated deeply with the message encapsulated in this single phrase, and what began as a religious initiative soon evolved into a broader social movement. Catholic parishes and dioceses encouraged not only the distribution of stickers but also incorporated the spirit of the campaign into homilies and catechetical education, urging believers to examine their own faults first in daily life. The movement’s goal extended beyond verbal affirmation, seeking to establish a culture of ethical living in personal relationships, workplaces, and broader society.\n\nThe key agents of this movement were the Catholic Lay Council and the Catholic Church leadership, most notably Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan. Cardinal Kim did not stop at symbolic participation; he consistently emphasized the spirit of \"It Is My Fault\" in his sermons, public lectures, and media interviews. His exemplary leadership gave the movement significant public credibility, prompting many non-Catholics to take notice. The media praised it as \"an invitation for the whole society to reflect and repent.\" At that time, religious leaders still retained considerable social trust, which further amplified the campaign’s influence.\n\nThe significance of the \"It Is My Fault\" movement can be evaluated on three levels. First, on a personal level, it fostered a culture of self-examination, countering the prevailing blame-shifting tendencies of Korean society. Second, at the communal level, it served as a starting point for the restoration of social trust, encouraging individuals to take responsibility within their families, workplaces, and communities. Third, on a societal level, it set an ethical standard, calling leaders across political and business sectors to self-reflection and accountability. Cardinal Kim, among others, consistently urged public figures to embody the \"It Is My Fault\" spirit.\n\nNevertheless, the movement also had clear limitations. Critics pointed out that emphasizing individual guilt without addressing structural injustices could deflect from the need for systemic reform. Some warned that \"excessively personalizing all blame risks obscuring the real perpetrators and structural problems of society.\" Over time, the movement gradually lost momentum, becoming reduced to a symbolic gesture by the mid-1990s. Despite this, its initial impact was profound: it challenged the complacent blame culture and elevated the value of personal conscience and humility within public discourse.\n\nUltimately, the \"It Is My Fault\" movement remains an important example of ethical social participation initiated by the Korean Catholic Church. Though it did not result in lasting institutional reforms, it significantly contributed to shaping a moral discourse centered on responsibility, conscience, and communal trust during a period of societal turbulence. Even decades later, references to the \"It Is My Fault\" spirit reemerged during national tragedies such as the Sewol Ferry Disaster, indicating that its symbolic significance remains potent today.\n\n\nCatholic and Protestant Minjung Movement\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the Korean Christian Minjung (people’s) movement encountered a major turning point. For Protestant Minjung churches, the era marked a shift from street-based, resistance-centered activism rooted in the 1970s–80s industrial mission tradition toward a more localized, community-oriented model. This was largely due to changing national conditions: the transition to democracy after 1987, the diffusion of social movements into the NGO sector, and the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (IMF crisis), which created deep, structural poverty. These factors redefined the \"people\" (minjung) not simply as laborers or urban poor, but now also as irregular workers, the homeless, migrant laborers, runaway youth, and the elderly poor. The church had to develop new modes of presence, accompaniment, and solidarity amid these evolving conditions.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Korea’s Christian poverty ministries were shaped by both theological reflection and new social demands. The Minjung churches inherited the legacy of the industrial mission and liberation theology, but began to evolve toward community-based models that sought long-term empowerment. One scholar notes that “by the 1990s, Minjung churches increasingly focused on job creation and welfare expansion through self-reliance support centers, rather than simply proclaiming liberation theology.” A representative example is Reverend Heo Byeong-seop’s Dongwol Church, which in 1990 founded the Wolsandong Construction Workers’ Cooperative to directly address the livelihood crisis of day laborers.\n\nAlongside this shift, Korean Christian poverty work began to intersect with the social economy movement. Scholars observe that “by the late 1990s, Christian sectors initiated a wide range of social economy experiments—including self-reliant enterprises, credit unions, and local currency programs—built on the legacy of Minjung theology and industrial mission.” These efforts were led by both Minjung churches and institutions like Sungkonghoe University. The aim was not only welfare provision but also structural alternatives to neoliberal austerity.\n\nKey community-based examples during this period include Dail Community (founded in 1988), Bapsang Community (1998), the Ansan Migrant Center (starting in 1994 as a foreign labor counseling center), the study-room movement (begun in 1984 and rapidly expanded in the 1990s), and St. Francis College (established in 2005). These movements strove to build “viable and alternative communities for the urban poor, including the homeless, single elders, migrant workers, and children in poverty.” Among them, Pastor Heo Ki-bok’s Bapsang Community developed what he called “creative welfare,” integrating daily meals, employment initiatives, and holistic self-reliance for the homeless as active subjects of change.\n\nThis trajectory should not be mistaken as a retreat from mission into charity. Rather, it reflects an intentional theological response to the structural violence of the market economy. Professor Cho Yong-hoon explains: “Mission among the poor is not merely about saving souls, but about restoring their humanity and agency. The poor are not only objects of mission but the agents of it.” In this view, Christian poverty work is a form of holistic mission grounded in missio Dei—the belief that God is already at work in the world’s pain, calling the church to participate in healing and justice. \n\nFor Protestant Minjung churches, this meant building new church forms—alternative worship spaces, communal economies, and hybrid organizations operating as both church and neighborhood center. It also required critical self-reflection, as aging congregations and the dispersal of the old Minjung movement led to internal doubts about identity and sustainability. Still, many continued to pursue grassroots pastoral care, local organizing, and new modes of public theology. Meanwhile, the Catholic Minjung-oriented movement evolved along a parallel but distinct path. Without formally establishing separate “Minjung churches,” the Catholic Church institutionalized its people-centered mission through structured ministries—such as the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice, labor pastoral centers, rural dioceses like Wonju, and welfare communities operated by religious orders. The iconic example of this is the House of Sharing, a healing and solidarity community for survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery. While not a parish, the community functions as a space where the wounds of history are remembered and God’s justice is embodied. Other initiatives included free meal services, shelters for migrant workers and runaway teens, and legal aid for the evicted.\n\nWhat unites both traditions—Protestant and Catholic—is their evolving interpretation of missio Dei. For Protestant theology, missio Dei reframed the church not as a missionary sender, but as a witness-participant in God’s ongoing work in the world. For Catholic theology, especially after Vatican II and Redemptoris Missio, the church’s mission was recast in trinitarian terms as participation in the loving, sending movement of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Both traditions thus emphasized that mission must take place where God is suffering—in the concrete lives of the poor, the excluded, and the displaced.\n\nIn summary, the Minjung mission in 1990s Korea cannot be reduced to either a continuation of liberation theology or a collapse into welfare services. It was an effort, on both Protestant and Catholic sides, to re-ground the meaning of Christian mission in the context of structural injustice, urban poverty, and neoliberal crisis. This movement laid the theological and organizational foundation for subsequent developments in Korea’s Christian engagement with social economy, ecological justice, and post-colonial reconciliation.\n\n\nTable.

This movement—built on Minjung theology, liberation theology, and missio Dei—interpreted Jesus’ gospel as unfolding not above but among the oppressed, and called for communities that embodied this incarnational vision. As the 1990s introduced new socioeconomic crises, including the 1997 IMF financial collapse, poverty became increasingly multilayered. The Minjung Church tradition responded by forming grassroots Christian communities that sought not merely to alleviate poverty, but to stand in solidarity with “the new Minjung”—homeless persons, migrant laborers, the working poor, and neglected children.\n\nThese Christian communities evolved from the legacy of earlier industrial missions and Minjung churches, such as those in the Guro district in the 1980s. During the 1990s, these churches increasingly separated from mainline denominational institutions and instead positioned themselves as independent communities rooted in the everyday lives of the poor. Their mission was not church growth, but the liberation and empowerment of oppressed people through deep engagement in labor activism, welfare organizing, and urban justice campaigns. However, in the wake of the IMF crisis, many of these churches encountered significant hardship. Membership declined, financial support dwindled, and internal tensions emerged over identity and strategy. In response, some Minjung churches began collaborating with NGOs and self-reliance centers, adopting social welfare approaches grounded in principles of participation and structural reform rather than charity alone.\n\nAmong the most prominent examples of this evolving movement were the Dure Community and the Dail Community. Both initiatives redefined what it meant to be a “church” in the neoliberal city: they rejected hierarchical institutional structures and instead built egalitarian, shared-living communities in urban poverty zones.\n\nThe Dure Community, founded in Neunggok-dong in Goyang City, established a lifestyle-based faith community among urban poor populations—unemployed persons, disabled people, day laborers, and elderly citizens. The community emphasized collective labor, shared meals, communal child-rearing, and mutual care as expressions of the gospel. Worship was not held in a building but enacted through daily life. Theologically, Dure was rooted in the Minjung understanding of the Kingdom of God as a communal restoration of justice and dignity. Their practice was built not around Sunday worship but around “living the gospel” through a just economic and social order\n\nIn contrast, the Dail Community emerged in 1988 when Rev. Il-do Choi began offering free meals to homeless persons near Cheongnyangni Station in Seoul. From this act of service grew a network of faith-based welfare institutions—soup kitchens, homeless shelters, rehabilitation centers, community libraries, and children's study rooms. Dail's philosophy rested on a simple but radical idea: “The gospel is a bowl of rice.” Eucharist was reinterpreted as a shared meal with the poor, and salvation was understood as communal healing and reconciliation through presence. Rather than seek converts or grow the church institutionally, Dail sought to “become bread” to its neighbors.\n\nBoth communities expanded the boundaries of the Minjung Church movement. They were living enactments of missio Dei, not in institutional or evangelical terms, but as the embodied presence of God's love in the suffering of the world. Their ministry was grounded in the conviction that “God’s Kingdom is realized in the suffering of the Minjung,” and that to serve, live with, and love the Minjung is to live out the gospel.\n\nThese experiments also demonstrated a willingness to reformulate Christian witness in the face of the growing secularization and privatization of religion. As institutional megachurches increasingly prioritized individual salvation, material prosperity, and political conservatism, Dure and Dail offered alternative forms of public faith—a Christianity that restored the communal, incarnational, and prophetic dimensions of the gospel. They rejected the consumerism and clericalism that had overtaken Korean Protestantism and instead reaffirmed that “the church is not a building but a community of shared suffering.”\n\nThe significance of these communities can be summarized in four points. First, they developed Christian responses to new forms of urban poverty—homelessness, unemployment, precarious labor, and social exclusion. Second, they embodied a model of social mission that integrated welfare and spirituality. Third, they acknowledged internal critiques—such as the charge of becoming “Minjung-less Minjung Churches”—and sought new ways to restore participation and solidarity. Finally, they provided a living answer to the theological question of what the church must be in an age of neoliberalism and spiritual crisis.\n\nToday, these community movements remain vital reminders that the church’s mission is not primarily to grow in number, but to embody the gospel where suffering is most acute. The Minjung Church Movement, in its transformation through communities like Dure and Dail, continues to pose the question: Whose side is the church on? ",
