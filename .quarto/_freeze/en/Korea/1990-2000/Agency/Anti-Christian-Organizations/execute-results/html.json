At the center of this transformation stood the Korean Federation of University Student Councils (HanChongRyun), which based its ideological foundation on Kim Il-sung’s Juche ideology and regarded Christianity as a religion complicit with capitalism and conservative political powers. From this perspective, Christianity was not merely a belief system but a hegemonic tool of oppression, thereby justifying the proliferation of anti-Christian sentiment in campus activism.\n\nStudent movements were not initially anti-Christian. During the 1980s democratization era, many Christian youth participated actively in human rights and justice-centered activism. However, as the 1990s progressed, Marxist-Leninist thought, anti-imperialism, and Juche ideology became dominant currents within the student movement, and Christianity was increasingly criticized as a bourgeois religion, a colonial remnant, and an anti-revolutionary structure. Despite some overlap with liberation theology or Minjung theology, Christian student groups were increasingly marginalized and dismissed as “non-struggling religious conformists.” In the midst of this, Christian Student Union (Giyeon) emerged as a response. Beginning in 1990 with the formation of the “Seoul National University Christian Union,” similar groups were established at Korea University (1991), and by 1993, at Myongji University, Sogang University, Yonsei University, Ewha Womans University, and Hongik University. These groups organized joint Christmas events and campus-wide worship services, and in 1994, they formed the “New General Christian Student Union,” which expanded to a broader regional network in 1995 through regular Giyeon retreats.\n\nDespite these efforts, Giyeon members faced significant structural and cultural barriers. Because many university student councils were controlled by HanChongRyun-aligned activists, Christian groups were often denied access to campus facilities, limited in their event planning, and restricted from posting announcements. Their presence on campuses dominated by political demonstrations and nationalist rhetoric was interpreted as passive or even traitorous. Even worship and prayer meetings were ridiculed as naive and politically neutral, rather than courageous acts of conscience.\n\nTensions intensified as HanChongRyun advanced the notion of “Criticism of Pure Academism,” denouncing students focused on academic achievement as bourgeois collaborators. In this environment, Christian students who emphasized personal faith and scholarship were portrayed as socially irresponsible. In some cases, Christian campus groups were directly excluded from campus life, or found their meeting times overlapped with political rallies, creating unavoidable conflict. Under such scrutiny, even regular worship gatherings had to be carried out discreetly.\n\nAnti-Christian sentiment was also spread systematically through educational and ideological training. HanChongRyun developed a multi-stage “consciousness-raising program” using student orientations, MTs (Membership Trainings), and cultural events. These programs emphasized dissatisfaction with reality (Stage 1), critique of capitalism (Stage 2), and revolutionary socialist theory (Stage 3), wherein Christianity was dismissed as false consciousness aligned with imperialism and bourgeois power. Propaganda materials—such as BBC’s “Kill 'Em All” or footage from North Korea—were shown to new students to incite anti-American and anti-Christian attitudes simultaneously.\n\nCulturally, anti-Christian sentiments were embedded in the organization of campus events. Student councils often promoted performances and festivals filled with vulgarity and violence, intentionally conflicting with Christian values. Rallies and protests were sometimes scheduled to interrupt Christian worship services. Campus newspapers, flyers, and performances further spread mockery and criticism of Christianity. This made it psychologically difficult for Christian students to publicly identify as believers.\n\nIn sum, the anti-Christian culture of the 1990s was shaped by ideological hostility, institutional marginalization, cultural antagonism, and educational indoctrination. These dynamics deeply affected not only the religious life of Christian students but also their social identity and participation in campus life. Yet in the midst of this environment, the Giyeon movement persisted—cultivating solidarity among Christian students, advocating a gospel-centered alternative vision, and planting the seeds of spiritual renewal that would bear fruit in later decades.\n\n\n ",
