In 1988, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued a declaration titled \"A Declaration of the Korean Christian Churches on National Reunification and Peace,\" commonly known as the 88 Declaration. In it, the NCCK confessed and repented that the South Korean church had long regarded anti-communist ideology as a religious tenet and had cursed the North Korean regime and its people. It called instead for peaceful reunification. This declaration caused considerable reverberations both within and outside the Korean church, but it also provoked strong backlash, especially from the broader Protestant community, which at the time leaned heavily conservative. In particular, senior pastors who had fled from North Korea—such as Han Kyung-jik, the elder statesman of Youngnak Church—felt a deep sense of crisis in response to the declaration.\n\nIn January 1989, Han Kyung-jik convened conservative religious elders at the Namhansanseong Retreat Center, where he had retired, and they resolved to establish a new Protestant federation to replace the NCCK. After a series of preparatory meetings and the formation of an organizing committee, the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) was formally launched on December 28, 1989. Although the CCK outwardly advocated church unity and the defense of the gospel, it was fundamentally a conservative reaction to the NCCK's progressive theological and political orientations, particularly its overtures to North Korea. The CCK was also committed to preserving anti-communist ideology.\n\nAllegations have long persisted that the political establishment—particularly the military regime of the time—was involved in the CCK's founding. Han Myung-soo, the first secretary general of the CCK, later testified in an interview that while he initially dismissed the rumors that the Chun Doo-hwan regime had orchestrated the formation of the CCK to counter the NCCK, he came to believe they were true while serving in office. He cited evidence such as the fact that conservative elders like Han Kyung-jik had supported the military regime and that officials from the Ministry of Culture and Public Information's religious affairs office frequently summoned the first CCK chairman, Park Maeng-soo, to give directives. Pastor Oh Choong-il, a member of the National Intelligence Service’s Truth and Reconciliation Committee, also stated during a 2005 forum that an NIS religious affairs officer had been involved in the CCK’s formation. These accounts strongly suggest that the CCK was supported—if not actively created—by the state to serve as a conduit for politicizing the conservative Protestant bloc.\n\nThe CCK began its activities with slogans such as \"defending biblical evangelical faith,\" \"church unity and cooperation,\" and \"fulfilling the church’s social responsibility.\" From the outset, it served as a federation of conservative denominations—including Presbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Pentecostal churches—and took the lead in developing a united evangelical front. The CCK emphasized the church's role in times of national crisis and promoted moral and ethical recovery in Korean society. In doing so, it functioned as a mouthpiece for the conservative church bloc, minimizing internal theological disputes while providing a common voice on major national issues.\n\nAt the time of its founding, the CCK was composed of 36 denominations. This number steadily increased throughout the 1990s and reached 66 by around 2011, encompassing the vast majority of Korean Protestant denominations. Although it lacked the long institutional history of the NCCK, which was founded in 1924, the CCK soon surpassed the NCCK in terms of membership size and political reach. It emerged as the de facto representative body of Korean Protestantism, often consulted by the political establishment and mainstream media as the voice of the Protestant church.\n\nThe CCK took clear political stances throughout the 1990s, especially around themes of anti-communism and moral conservatism. In the 1992 presidential election, it openly supported candidate Kim Young-sam, who was also an elder in the Presbyterian Church. This overt endorsement of a political candidate provoked criticism and raised concerns about the church’s involvement in electoral politics. Nonetheless, the CCK leadership defended its actions as a defense of freedom and democracy, and a stance against communism. After Kim Young-sam assumed office in 1993, the CCK maintained close ties with the ruling party and continued to advocate for the National Security Law, North Korean human rights issues, and national security awareness. As a result, the CCK became an increasingly influential actor in national politics, and in return, the government used it as a channel to communicate with and rally conservative Christian voters.\n\nDuring this period, the CCK also prioritized church ethics and the fight against heresy. Its internal Heresy and Cults Countermeasures Committee worked in cooperation with major denominations to identify and denounce religious groups deemed heretical. The CCK’s actions in this regard were seen as an attempt to protect doctrinal purity and the public image of Korean Christianity, especially following scandals such as the failed prediction of the rapture by the Dami Mission in 1992. Although these activities were praised by some as necessary safeguards, they also generated criticism about excessive heresy labeling and interdenominational conflicts.\n\nElder statesmen like Han Kyung-jik and denominational leaders such as Park Maeng-soo played a crucial role in founding and leading the CCK. Over the decade, CCK leadership included rotating representatives from major denominations: Jeong Jin-kyung and Lee Sung-taek from the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong), Im Ok from the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap), and Ji Deok from the Baptist Church. By the late 1990s, senior pastors from megachurches began to assume greater influence, such as Lee Man-shin from the Holiness Church and Kil Ja-yeon from the Presbyterian Church in Korea, both of whom later served as CCK presidents. These leaders brought their denominational weight and public recognition to elevate the CCK’s status. Alongside these formal leaders, prominent evangelical pastors such as Kim Jun-gon (Korea Campus Crusade for Christ), Kim Hong-do (Kumnan Church), Cho Yong-gi (Yoido Full Gospel Church), and Kim Jang-hwan (Baptist Church) contributed significantly, if informally, to shaping the CCK’s direction. These figures supported the CCK’s initiatives with revival meetings and public sermons that emphasized anti-communism and conservative theology, further consolidating the evangelical base.\n\nThe rise of the CCK also formalized the divide between conservative and progressive camps within Korean Protestantism. Whereas the NCCK pursued ecumenical cooperation, dialogue with North Korea, and social justice advocacy, the CCK refused to join global ecumenical bodies like the WCC or the CCA and instead built its own network of conservative churches. The CCK sharply criticized any outreach to the North as ideological betrayal and rejected progressive theological trends. This antagonism exacerbated the polarization within the Korean church.\n\nExternally, the CCK faced criticism from civic groups and other religious communities. Its electoral intervention in 1992 was condemned as a violation of church-state separation. Civil society organizations accused it of being a patriarchal, political interest group, and media coverage increasingly highlighted its ties to right-wing politics. In response, the CCK held national prayer breakfasts and revival meetings, emphasizing spiritual awakening and national repentance to legitimize its public role.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the CCK deepened its relationship with conservative political forces. Under President Kim Young-sam, its leaders were invited to advisory committees and national ceremonies. After the 1997 financial crisis, the election of President Kim Dae-jung brought a shift in state ideology. The CCK reacted cautiously to Kim’s Sunshine Policy, with some members labeling it pro-North. Nevertheless, the organization refrained from direct confrontation, maintaining a watchful stance while quietly voicing concern.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the CCK had become a key platform for the political mobilization of conservative Christians. Its leaders began to form links with far-right civic organizations, preparing counteractions to anticipated left-leaning governments. This laid the groundwork for the so-called Christian Right in the 2000s, which became active in opposing homosexuality, supporting pro-U.S. policies, and staging nationalist rallies. These developments show that while the CCK maintained institutional decorum during the 1990s, it was already consolidating its political identity.\n\nIn sum, the CCK’s status in 1990s Korean society was complex. On one hand, it provided unity for conservative Protestant churches and amplified their collective voice. It helped congregants preserve a coherent religious identity in a time of rapid political transition. However, the CCK also aligned closely with power, abandoned its prophetic role, and became embroiled in scandals and factional disputes. Cases of corruption and power struggles—especially over presidential elections within the CCK itself—eventually eroded its moral legitimacy. Major denominations began to withdraw, and its representational authority in the church community diminished. Still, the historical significance of the CCK in the 1990s cannot be denied. It mobilized the evangelical right and demonstrated both the strength and limits of religious political engagement. Its experience offers a critical case study in the fusion of religion and politics under the banner of anti-communism in modern Korea.\n\n\nNational Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)\n\n\nAfter the democratization of 1987, South Korea entered a transitional period in which military dictatorship came to an end and civil society began to expand autonomously. In this new context, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), which had long fought for human rights and democratization, ironically began to experience a loss of public influence. Civil society no longer needed the church as a protective platform, and Protestant organizations like the NCCK, which had once incubated the democratic movement, found themselves gradually marginalized by new professional, secular movements with their own resources and networks.\n\nInternally, the absence of a common external enemy such as authoritarian rule weakened moral cohesion within the ecumenical movement. Conservative and progressive denominations, which had previously cooperated under tacit agreements, began to clash over direction, leadership appointments, and theological visions. Amid this shifting environment, the 1988 Declaration—officially titled The Korean Church’s Declaration on National Reunification and Peace—became both a milestone and a turning point.\n\nThe declaration affirmed five principles for peaceful reunification by expanding the 1972 July 4th North-South Joint Statement’s framework of autonomy, peace, and national unity to include humanitarianism and democratization of the reunification process. It also emphasized the need to sign a peace treaty to replace the armistice, demanded the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea, and called for nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula. This declaration, two years in the making, reflected a comprehensive theological and political agenda grounded in national repentance, human dignity, and peace theology. However, the declaration sparked fierce backlash. Conservative Protestant groups, including the Korean Evangelical Fellowship, Presbyterian elders' associations, and interdenominational lay organizations, condemned the NCCK for issuing a statement that \"threatened national security\" and was \"tantamount to communist collaboration\". \n\nParticular controversy arose over the declaration’s proposals for U.S. troop withdrawal and its affirmation of \"people-centered reunification,\" which many interpreted as aligned with leftist ideology. Even within the NCCK’s own member denominations, such as the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK, Tonghap), dissenting voices questioned the declaration’s legitimacy. This tension culminated in the 1989 formation of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK), a conservative ecumenical federation created in direct opposition to the NCCK’s progressive positions. From its inception, the CCK exceeded the NCCK in size and influence, securing strong financial support from megachurches and cultivating close ties with political elites, especially under the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations. During these years, the NCCK was sidelined from national religious leader meetings, government functions, and state consultations, while the CCK was treated as the legitimate Protestant representative.\n\nWithin the NCCK, conflicts over leadership selection, denominational representation, and funding only deepened the crisis. The loss of financial support from the World Council of Churches (WCC) forced the NCCK to adopt a more conservative tone to appeal to domestic backers. Attempts to expand lay leadership, partner with regional churches, or create new movements failed to materialize. Meanwhile, the NCCK lost its symbolic status as a safe haven for whistleblowers and protestors, a role it once held during the dictatorship era. Despite these internal and external challenges, the 1988 Declaration remains a landmark in the history of Korean Christianity. It represented the first time that a major Protestant body offered a theologically grounded, politically engaged roadmap for peaceful reunification. Though polarizing, the declaration laid the groundwork for subsequent events such as Rev. Moon Ik-hwan’s and Lim Su-kyung’s visits to North Korea and reenergized discussions within the WCC and global Christian networks on Korean peace issues.\n\nIn short, the 1990s were a period of paradox for the NCCK. On one hand, it suffered from organizational decline, public marginalization, and internal disputes. On the other, it produced a morally ambitious vision that attempted to reorient Korean Protestantism toward justice, repentance, and peacebuilding. This era ultimately forced the NCCK to reexamine its identity and mission within a democratized, pluralistic society.\n\n\nChristian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development (CISJD)\n\n\nThe Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development (hereafter CISJD), established in 1979 based on ecumenical principles, pursued the vision of building a \"just and democratic society\" and a \"community of coexistence.\" During the 1990s, Korean churches continued to wrestle with major issues such as democratization, social justice, and reunification. In this context, CISJD played a prominent role, particularly in the fields of labor, human rights, church reform, and reunification. For example, a 1988 report published by CISJD titled The Presidential Election Struggle: The Logic and Practice of the People’s Democratic Movement revealed the organization's strong support for democratization and labor movements. This shows that CISJD aligned itself with the struggles of workers and the oppressed and was committed to expanding their rights in society. At the time, issues such as securing the right to organize, opposing privatization, and protecting freedom of expression were central, and CISJD actively responded to these concerns both inside and outside the church.\n\nCISJD supported labor rights throughout the 1990s. It maintained solidarity with newly emerging labor unions after democratization, advocating for the elimination of irregular labor and the freedom to organize. The organization's focus on the rights of the working poor and the promotion of democracy within the workplace highlights its commitment to Christian social ethics. Though detailed media coverage from the time is limited, the institute’s position was clearly aligned with broader progressive Christian engagement in labor issues.\n\nThe 1990s marked a period of expanding civil liberties in Korea. CISJD, whose founding vision was rooted in justice and democracy, was naturally active in supporting causes such as freedom of conscience and freedom of speech. In particular, the organization sided with the progressive factions within the Korean church that supported liberation theology and criticized lingering authoritarianism. While specific declarations from the 1990s are scarce, it is evident that CISJD advocated for civic engagement and human dignity in both public and church discourse.\n\nOne of the institute’s core commitments was church reform. As the Korean church grew in size and wealth, problems of corruption, materialism, and clerical authoritarianism became more prominent. In response, CISJD called for a return to “anti-mammonist faith” and emphasized the mission of the church in terms of service and public responsibility. It promoted internal democratization of church structures, the inclusion of young people and women in leadership, and critical reflection on theology and ecclesiology. These reformist impulses continued into the 21st century—for example, CISJD hosted academic forums on topics such as “Korean Churches and the Youth.”\n\nCISJD also played a part in peace and reunification movements. From its inception, the institute had emphasized peaceful coexistence and dialogue, and in the 1990s it supported inter-Korean exchange and nuclear disarmament. In later years, it published policy reports such as “How to Resume the Peace Process on the Korean Peninsula.”¹ This continuing interest reflects the Korean church’s long-standing concern with peacemaking and overcoming Cold War divisions. The institute also collaborated with NGOs working on reunification and humanitarian aid to North Korea.\n\nBeyond these thematic areas, CISJD engaged in wide-ranging solidarity work on issues such as women’s rights, the environment, and the urban poor. Notably, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (Korean Council, formerly) used part of CISJD’s office in Seoul in the late 1990s, showing the institute’s support for feminist and anti-colonial advocacy.\n\nThese activities were highly significant within the context of the 1990s Korean church. While conservative, charismatic, and prosperity-driven churches gained momentum, progressive Protestant voices like CISJD provided a critical counterbalance. The institute played a bridge role between church and society, advocating justice-based theology rooted in minjung and liberation theology. It helped sustain a prophetic tradition within Korean Christianity by encouraging public engagement, theological reflection, and ethical responsibility.\n\n\nChristian Ethics Movement for Practice (CEM)\n\n\nThe Christian Ethics Movement for Practice (CEM) was founded in 1987, during a transitional moment in South Korea’s democratization, when society was seeking a new moral compass and ethical framework. Throughout the 1990s, the organization carried out a broad range of reform initiatives grounded in evangelical faith, addressing not only personal piety but also contributing structurally to the improvement of ethical consciousness and civic responsibility in Korean society.\n\nCEM’s emergence coincided with the democratizing energy following the June 1987 Uprising and the July–August labor movement. At a time when the radical theology of the minjung movement and the institutional church both struggled to adapt, CEM provided a third way—a model of “social reform through personal ethical renewal.” \n\nAs a Christian civic organization, it extended evangelical ethics into the public sphere and chose institutional reform and lifestyle-based movements over political radicalism. One of the most significant actions during the 1990s was the Clean Elections Movement. In the 1991 local elections, CEM organized the “Christian Committee for Clean Elections” to resist electoral corruption and pastoral interference in politics. This initiative promoted a set of ethical criteria for political engagement, working in collaboration with groups such as the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice (CCEJ) and the YMCA. Its impact continued through subsequent elections in 2000 and 2004, contributing to broader coalitions like the “Civic Movement Council for Clean Elections”. Another major effort was the Healthy Church Movement, which targeted internal corruption within churches, especially the practice of hereditary pastoral succession. In the late 1990s, CEM issued public statements opposing this custom and petitioned denominations for reform. Although this created tensions with some conservative denominations, it played a pivotal role in embedding the logic of self-regulation within Korean Protestantism. CEM also spearheaded the Cultural Consumer Movement, aimed at reforming unethical media content. It launched the “Right Media Reading Campaign” to criticize sensationalism in sports tabloids and promote media ethics. By organizing petitions and advertising boycotts, it applied civic pressure that led to concrete changes in broadcasting regulations. However, its activism sparked both alliances with certain public agencies and conflict with liberal civic groups who saw it as moralistic or censorious.\n\nThese campaigns were underpinned by a theological commitment to evangelical public witness. Professor Son Bong-ho, a founding leader, argued that “if Christians fail to set a moral example, they have no authority to criticize social corruption.” He emphasized the necessity of personal integrity as the basis for credible public ethics. CEM's intellectual foundation rested on evangelical covenantal ethics, shaped in part by the Lausanne Covenant, which asserted that “we must participate in God’s concern to liberate people from every kind of oppression”.\n\nCEM established a distinct voice within Korean society, achieving moral authority across both religious and secular spaces. It collaborated with civic organizations like YMCA, CCEJ, and media watchdogs, while maintaining critical distance from more radical groups. Especially in economic justice campaigns, it rejected class-based narratives, advocating instead for moral responsibility and incremental reform. This exposed it to criticisms from both progressive and conservative quarters—seen by some as “limited moralism” and by others as “unnecessary political engagement”. Nevertheless, CEM made a lasting impact in four key areas: (1) initiating ethical reform within Protestant churches, (2) modeling evangelical civic engagement, (3) reviving ethical discourse across multiple sectors, and (4) serving as a bridge between faith communities and secular civil society. In this way, CEM opened a new path for evangelical Christianity in post-democratization Korea. Without resorting to militant politics or ideological dogmatism, it demonstrated the possibility of “critical distance and constructive reform” through ethical practices rooted in faith.\n\n\nKorea Association for Creation Research (KACR)\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) actively expanded its organizational structure and public outreach. Originally founded in 1981 by Dr. Kim Young-gil of KAIST, the association was officially incorporated as a legal non-profit organization in November 1990 by the Ministry of Education, laying a firm institutional foundation for its work. Regional branches steadily increased; starting with Daejeon and Daegu in 1981, the organization had more than 10 branches nationwide by the late 1990s.\n\nThe KACR held annual lectures and symposiums on creation science. In celebration of its 10th anniversary, the association hosted a large-scale international symposium at Onnuri Church in August 1991, featuring six speakers from countries including the U.S., Australia, and Japan, and drawing approximately 4,000 attendees.Another international symposium followed in 1993, held during the Daejeon Expo, with five Korean and six foreign scientists participating. In addition to such major events, the association organized smaller public debates and seminars across churches and universities. The KACR also developed a variety of publications, including the periodical Creation and textbooks aligned with its scientific creationist perspective. In 1990, the association published Natural Science, a university-level science textbook written by 27 members, attracting attention from both church and academic communities. Other publications included introductory books such as What You Didn’t Know About Creation Science, as well as evangelistic pamphlets and visual materials.\n\nIn 1993, the KACR opened a creation science exhibition hall during the Daejeon Expo. The hall, comprising seven themed sections—such as Genesis creation, Noah’s Flood, geology, and fossils—attracted around 60,000 visitors during the Expo’s three-month run. The association also developed university courses at Christian institutions like Myongji University and Handong Global University, and in 1995, launched the “Creation Science Supporters Fellowship,” composed of pastors and laypeople who actively supported church-based creation science education. Despite these initiatives, attempts to integrate creationist content into public school science curricula met resistance. Efforts to include creationism in textbooks failed, and the KACR even pursued constitutional litigation challenging the exclusion.\n\nThe KACR is rooted in the evangelical and fundamentalist Christian tradition. Interest in creation science intensified after the 1980 World Evangelization Crusade held in Seoul, where a seminar titled “Creation or Evolution?” featured American speakers like Henry Morris and Duane Gish. This event sparked momentum for the association’s official launch the following year. Theologically, the KACR adhered to biblical inerrancy and a literal interpretation of Genesis, including young-earth creationism. It sought to present creationism in the guise of scientific inquiry, collaborating with fundamentalist institutions like the U.S.-based Institute for Creation Research (ICR). Churches from both conservative and some moderate Protestant denominations provided financial support. In 1994, Pastor Hong Nam-yi of Daejeon’s Chanyang Church and other clergy formed a creation science pastoral support group, which developed into a larger fellowship the following year. This movement was widely seen in the Christian community as a defense of biblical worldview and a faith-based educational ministry.\n\nThe KACR’s efforts to challenge evolutionary theory sparked significant tension in academic and educational circles. Mainstream scientists regarded creation science as lacking empirical rigor. In 1982, at a symposium organized by the Inha University Natural Science Research Institute, only evolutionist scholars presented because the creationist speakers declined the invitation. Philosophers of science like Jang Dae-ik and Ko Myung-jin classified creation science as “pseudoscience” due to its lack of falsifiability.\n\nEducation policy also became a battleground. The KACR opposed the exclusive teaching of evolution in secondary school textbooks and asserted that doing so violated religious freedom. They even prepared a constitutional appeal. This tension continued into the 2000s as curriculum review guidelines became a subject of dispute. While some churches pushed for curriculum changes, science educators and teachers' groups criticized the KACR’s efforts as unscientific and ideologically driven. In 1991, the science magazine Science Dong-A featured a three-part dialogue between creationist and evolutionist scholars, underscoring the controversy’s depth.\n\nThe KACR's work occupied a contentious space between Christian and scientific communities. Coverage by mainstream media varied: conservative outlets like Kukmin Ilbo reported on the constitutional appeal from a sympathetic angle, while progressive outlets like Hankyoreh or Kyunghyang Shinmun tended to be critical. Hankyoreh Science Webzine published retrospective essays comparing the creation-evolution debate in Korea to the 1925 Scopes “Monkey” Trial in the United States. Christian media and broadcasters portrayed the KACR more favorably, highlighting its conferences, publications, and exhibits as efforts to demonstrate the compatibility of faith and science. Public outreach was relatively effective: the 1993 Expo exhibit drew tens of thousands, and creation science lectures became a common feature of youth ministries in larger churches.\n\nAssessments of the creation science movement vary widely. Supporters view the KACR’s work as a vital campaign to defend religious freedom and biblical worldview. The association argued that exclusive teaching of evolution infringed upon believers' rights and religious pluralism. Parents and pastors praised its potential to provide Christian youth with a faith-compatible view of science. Socially, it raised broader questions about religious freedom, scientific authority, and educational diversity. Critics, however, argued that creation science lacked scientific rigor and undermined quality science education. Professor Kim Woo-jae was sued for defamation by the KACR after labeling the group as “pseudoscientific,” but the charges were dismissed. Philosophers like Jang Dae-ik applied the standards of Popperian falsifiability and Kuhnian paradigms to argue that creation science was unscientific by definition. They warned that the movement promoted anti-intellectualism and could erode the integrity of science education.\n\nIn sum, the Korea Association for Creation Research played a pivotal role in introducing the creation-evolution debate to Korean society in the 1990s. The movement mobilized the conservative Christian base to engage in education and science discourse while sparking societal reflection on the boundaries between science and religion. From a neutral perspective, the KACR significantly influenced faith-based education in Korea but remained deeply controversial in terms of scientific legitimacy.\n\n\nKorean Student Christian Federation (KSCF)\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF) sought to overcome internal fragmentation and respond to a rapidly changing social landscape by reorienting itself as a democratic, grassroots movement. This decade marked a turning point as KSCF attempted to recover from the ideological conflicts and organizational crises that had plagued it since the 1980s.\n\nOne of the most significant crises emerged in 1989 during the appointment of a new general secretary, which revealed deep internal divisions. This incident, though initially seen as a personnel issue, reflected broader, long-standing tensions over the relationship between “faith and politics” and “gospel and society.” As one source notes, “the appointment controversy dealt a critical blow to the credibility of the organization, exhausting its moral and activist energy, and leading to distrust among students”. This triggered a serious internal reckoning about KSCF’s democratic structure and mission. In response, the 1991 General Assembly declared a plan of “reunification,” outlining strategic priorities such as the consolidation of ideological direction, the reinforcement of local chapters, and the democratization of organizational processes. These measures signaled a transition from a narrowly focused movement to a broader people-centered activism. The federation also worked to restore relationships with denominational churches and expand its national support base.\n\nAmong KSCF’s flagship initiatives in the 1990s was the “Suffering and Resurrection Campaign,” which built on the legacy of earlier movements like the April Revolution commemorations of the 1970s and 1980s. In this framework, KSCF aligned itself with contemporary struggles for justice. In 1993, students organized a nationwide fundraising campaign for former “comfort women”; in 1994, they mobilized around the issues of prisoner amnesty and the abolition of the National Security Law; and in 1995, they led campus-wide solidarity campaigns with foreign laborers.\n\nRural mission work was also restructured in light of new realities. Student groups no longer relied on top-down programs but instead designed context-sensitive summer ministries through grassroots planning. These efforts emphasized community-based faith practices that embodied social solidarity. Additionally, KSCF did not limit its work to activism but fostered theological reflection and research. Through publications such as Bible and Praxis, the federation explored a biblically grounded theology of liberation and promoted socially engaged Christian thought. This was part of an effort “to root the student movement not only in activism but in a theological tradition responsive to Korean society’s ethical and spiritual crises”.\n\nIn sum, the 1990s were a decade of redefinition for the KSCF. Despite internal and external challenges, it remained a space where faith intersected with democracy, justice, and intellectual inquiry. Its trajectory during this time demonstrated how Christian student movements could serve as laboratories for integrating gospel witness with public ethics in a transforming Korean society.\n\n\nYWCA\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the Korean YWCA entered a significant period of transition marked by institutional expansion and a deepening reflection on its identity as a Christian women's movement. Following decades of cautious engagement during authoritarian rule, the organization began to ask itself fundamental questions about its social mission—“What is the YWCA and what should it become?”—as it responded to the democratization and decentralization movements unfolding across South Korea. This decade witnessed a strategic tension between institutionalization and prophetic action, as the YWCA assumed new roles in public service delivery while also trying to remain faithful to its mission of Christian-inspired social justice and women’s empowerment.\n\nOne major development during this time was the YWCA’s growing participation in the state-led privatization of welfare services. Beginning in the early 1990s, local YWCA branches across the country received contracts from the government to operate child care centers, women’s job training institutes, counseling services, and shelters. By 1995, the number of local YWCA social workers had grown from 93 in 1981 to nearly 1,500, signaling a rapid quantitative expansion. However, this growth also raised internal concerns. The shift toward welfare provision risked diffusing the YWCA's core movement identity, as staff became increasingly absorbed in facility management rather than grassroots advocacy.\n\nThis institutional turn was not merely bureaucratic; it was also animated by regional innovation and experimentation. In Gwangju, the YWCA served as a vital hub of social resistance and citizen education well into the 1990s. Programs such as the Citizen Forums, Thursday Prayer Meetings, and the People’s Forum (Minjung Nondan) brought together leading theologians, dissident intellectuals, and church-based activists. Figures such as Moon Ik-hwan, Han Wan-sang, and Suh Nam-dong delivered public lectures at Gwangju YWCA, directly challenging the legacy of military rule and cultivating a new public ethos of peace, human rights, and social participation. In addition, the YWCA hosted alternative education initiatives like Winter College, where dismissed professors from the “Education Guidelines Incident” (1990) gave lectures to students and citizens alike. These programs positioned Gwangju YWCA as a “public salon” and spiritual base for democratic civic culture in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Daegu YWCA maintained a sustained focus on social service and civic education, even within the constraints of a politically conservative region. Throughout the 1990s, Daegu YWCA emphasized gendered community care and women’s empowerment through programs aimed at job training, youth education, and environmental activism. Interviews with local activists reveal that many were inspired by their earlier involvement in student and democratization movements, and they carried this vision into their YWCA work. Although the YWCA in Daegu did not pursue overt political activism like some other civic groups, it cultivated social change through what might be termed a “quiet pedagogy of citizenship,” rooted in Christian values and persistent local engagement.\n\nA key sector of transformation for YWCA in this period was care work, as the organization restructured its employment support programs in response to shifts in labor and welfare policy. Originally operating under a free job referral model, YWCA began transitioning to social enterprises, cooperatives, and fee-based placement services to secure sustainability. The YWCA resisted the market logic that dominated care services, instead proposing an alternative model grounded in communal responsibility, women's rights, and the public good. This approach was dubbed the “Care Justice Movement,” and aimed not only at delivering quality services but also at reforming social perceptions of domestic labor and improving working conditions for female care workers.\n\nYWCA’s care-related projects were characterized by several distinctive features. First, they were rooted in a member-based community ethos, allowing for mutual support between the organization and care workers. Second, the organization had a rich history of training and credentialing, ensuring professionalism. Third, its Christian and feminist mission gave workers a sense of pride and ethical responsibility. Fourth, it maintained a strong national-local network capable of responding to diverse needs. Finally, its longstanding partnership—sometimes critical—with government agencies enabled it to shape welfare policy while retaining its independent moral vision.\n\nIn sum, the 1990s Korean YWCA embodied a multifaceted identity: a care service provider, a Christian reform movement, and a civic educator. While it expanded into the formal welfare apparatus, it also maintained a critical and creative presence in local communities. By integrating faith, gender justice, and public service, YWCA redefined what a women’s organization could look like in post-authoritarian South Korea—neither narrowly religious nor simply secular, neither merely charitable nor overtly confrontational. Rather, it stood as a mediating space where ordinary women could participate in the remaking of Korean civil society.\n\n ",
