Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the onset of North Korea’s own economic disaster—known as the “Arduous March”—the government faced internal strain and international isolation. Within this context, religious belief, particularly Christianity, was considered fundamentally subversive. As Juche ideology continued to define the metaphysical and moral structure of North Korean society, Christians were systematically targeted as enemies of the revolution and as carriers of foreign influence.\n\nThe most immediate form of repression during this decade was the intensified persecution of underground churches. As famine and hardship forced tens of thousands of North Koreans across the border into China, many encountered Christian missionaries or Korean churches there. Some were converted and returned to North Korea, bringing with them Bibles and an underground evangelical fervor that spread primarily through family networks. However, this posed a direct threat to the ideological control of the state, and the government responded with violent suppression. Numerous cases have been documented in which Christians were arrested, tortured, publicly executed, or sent with their entire families to political prison camps such as Yodok.\n\nOne of the most chilling examples was the execution of a woman named Ri Hyeon-ok in 2009 (widely understood to reflect practices continuing from the 1990s). She was reportedly shot in public for distributing Bibles, while her family members were sent to a prison camp. Earlier, in 2006, a former North Korean army officer named Son Jong-nam was arrested for preaching Christianity. He was reportedly tortured in Pyongyang’s State Security Department detention center and died in 2008 from internal injuries sustained under interrogation. These incidents were not isolated but part of a broader pattern in which any expression of Christian faith—prayer, possession of a Bible, or even the act of singing hymns—was criminalized under charges of espionage or treason.\n\nThis climate of repression was underpinned by the regime’s view of Christianity as ideologically incompatible with Juche thought. While Kim Il-sung declared in his memoirs that Christian values of peace and harmony did not contradict his worldview, in practice, the state emphasized absolute loyalty to the “Suryong” (Leader) and framed Christianity as a foreign-born ideology that disrupted national unity.⁵ The philosophical and theological conflict between the transcendental God of Christianity and the deified image of the Kim dynasty was irreconcilable in the state’s cultural policy.\n\nDespite the brutal crackdown on unofficial religious life, the North Korean government maintained the appearance of religious tolerance for external audiences. State-controlled institutions like the Korean Christian Federation (KCF), Bongsu Church, and Changchung Catholic Cathedral were revitalized or built during the late 1980s and showcased throughout the 1990s as evidence of religious freedom. These were, however, under strict surveillance by the Ministry of State Security. Services were often choreographed for visiting delegations from the World Council of Churches or South Korean religious representatives. Former defectors and researchers have noted that congregants were often selected party members, and sermons carefully scripted.\n\nWithin North Korean society itself, anyone with a Christian family background was stigmatized. According to the country’s “songbun” classification system, descendants of Christian families were labeled as “impure” and denied access to higher education, residence in Pyongyang, or Party membership. This form of inherited guilt functioned as a long-term mechanism of religious repression, ensuring the containment of Christianity not only as a faith but as a social identity.\n\nNevertheless, even in these dire conditions, Christianity did not disappear. Hidden worship continued in small domestic gatherings. Families passed down prayers and scriptures in secret. The number of active underground believers may have remained small, but their survival testifies to a faith resilient under extreme duress. Scholars and defector testimonies suggest that Christian households persisted by integrating faith into intimate kin networks and preserving oral traditions. This invisible church—distinct from the state-sponsored KCF—remained deeply rooted in both theological conviction and political defiance.\n\nIn summary, the 1990s marked a paradoxical decade for North Korean Christianity: a time of brutal suppression and quiet endurance. While state ideology portrayed religion as a relic of the past and a threat to national security, underground believers risked their lives to worship. Their existence stood as a form of spiritual resistance, one that the regime could suppress but never entirely erase.\n\n ",
