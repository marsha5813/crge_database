Throughout his literary career, particularly in works such as Son of Man (1979), Lee engaged Christianity not through outright hostility but through rigorous existential questioning. He framed Christianity not simply as a religious faith but as a Western ideological force competing with East Asian traditions such as Confucianism. Lee Mun-yeol is fundamentally a conservative writer deeply attached to Confucian traditions and held a strong sense of resistance toward Western civilization, which included Christianity as a major subset. For Lee, Christianity was not merely a religion but a symbolic force representing the cultural and philosophical conflict between East and West, framed primarily through the issue of “power.”\n\nHis major work, Son of Man (1979), deeply explores the theological foundation of Christianity while maintaining a critical stance. In this novel, Lee addresses core theological questions that had been prominent in 19th-century liberal theology: the tension between the divinity and humanity of Jesus, the question of whether Christianity emerged from Jesus' own teachings or from Paul's reinterpretation, and the absolute authority of the Scriptures. By portraying the divided consciousness of Jesus—His divinity and humanity—through the characters Min Yo-seop and Ahaseuerus, Lee invites readers to wrestle with the essential question: \"Was Jesus truly both fully divine and fully human?\" Son of Man also raises the issue of how a new religion—Christianity—could have emerged from a Jewish prophet like Jesus. Through the relationship between Min Yo-seop and Jo Dong-pal, Lee draws a parallel between Jesus and Paul, suggesting provocatively that \"Christianity originated from Jesus but was ultimately shaped by Paul's theology.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, although Lee did not bring Christianity back to the forefront of his later novels as he had in Son of Man, his deep engagement with Christian motifs persisted. As Cha Jungsik observed, Lee Mun-yeol should be seen as a writer who “internalized Christian theological images and motifs,” even though he was not a Christian himself. That is, Lee did not explicitly present himself as a Christian author, yet biblical themes and questions about the relationship between God and humanity continued to permeate his work.\n\nFrom a theological perspective, Lee’s approach to Christianity was notably unique. Rather than rejecting or ridiculing Christianity outright, he seriously grappled with the existential questions Christianity poses, while simultaneously casting doubt on its ultimate answers. His literary world consistently interrogated the human condition through the lens of Christianity without offering simplistic or triumphant resolutions.\n\nHowever, scholars have also pointed out limitations in Lee’s perspective. As Lee Dong-ha argued, because Lee centered his exploration around \"the problem of power\" in a highly secular and confrontational manner, true theological dialogue or mutual openness with Christianity was never fully realized. Christianity remained, in his eyes, an ultimately rival force against his deeply rooted East Asian traditionalism.\n\nNevertheless, the significance of Lee Mun-yeol’s engagement with Christianity during the 1990s can be summarized as follows:\n\nFirst, he accomplished one of the rare serious literary explorations of theological issues in modern Korean literature.\n\nSecond, he moved beyond both missionary literature and dismissive secular readings by treating Christianity as an existential human condition.\n\nThird, he bequeathed to readers not a simplistic call to faith, but a profound intellectual engagement with the fundamental questions Christianity raises.\n\nIn conclusion, Lee Mun-yeol stands as one of the most daring and complex figures in Korean literary history with regard to Christianity. Without identifying as a Christian himself, he nevertheless opened new intellectual and literary spaces for dialogue between Korean literature and Christian theology. His work challenged and expanded the boundaries of religious inquiry in Korean literature, offering readers a unique example of how literature can meaningfully engage theology without religious affiliation. Although Lee Mun-yeol was not a Christian, he significantly influenced Korean perceptions of Christianity by presenting it as a critical existential problem rather than merely a foreign ideology. His literary interrogation of Christian theology helped establish a new model for incorporating Christian motifs in Korean modern literature beyond simple advocacy or rejection.\n\n\n ",
