As the first “Elder-President” of South Korea, Kim Young-sam embodied the convergence of religious conviction and political ambition, marking a profound shift in the relationship between church and state. \n\nKim’s 1992 presidential campaign marked a turning point in Korean Protestant political activism. As a well-known elder of Chungguhyun Church, Kim received enthusiastic support from conservative Protestant circles. At the height of the campaign, a “prayer breakfast for candidate Kim Young-sam was held at the 63 Building in Seoul, attended by over 1,000 pastors, showcasing the consolidated political power of Protestantism”. Slogans such as “Let a believer win the election” and “Let hymns echo from Jangwi-dae” were shouted across churches nationwide.\n\nOne of the most significant events in this context was the 1992 declaration titled \"The Future of Korean Politics Is in the Hands of Christianity,\" held at the Christian Cultural Center in Seoul. This meeting marked the first time Protestant leaders openly claimed a political mandate, asserting, “Christianity can no longer remain neutral in politics”]. Organized by leading pastors from megachurches such as Yoido Full Gospel Church and Chungguhyun Church, the declaration set the precedent for large-scale religious intervention in elections. It also promoted a narrative that pitted Protestantism against rival religious influences, particularly Buddhism and Catholicism.\n\nThe Protestant mobilization went far beyond simple endorsements. As Kim Young-sam declared, “I will not campaign on Sundays,” appealing directly to Protestant sensibilities and gaining the trust of churchgoers who viewed Sabbath observance as sacred. Conservative Christian leaders responded by establishing prayer cells and holding election seminars in over 170 regions under the slogan of national evangelization. “What had previously been silent support now became a well-organized electoral force,” effectively turning churches into campaign hubs.\n\nThis religious mobilization led to a political climate where, as noted by scholars, “the Protestant church gained the ability to influence elections structurally”. Pastors publicly declared the need for Christian political empowerment, with some asserting, “We must no longer remain passive—we must become a political force”. The Korean Christian Federation (Han Ki Chong), formed around this time, played a significant role in coordinating Protestant political activities and became an institutional platform for subsequent political advocacy.\n\nThe result of this mobilization was a resounding electoral victory in Busan and Gyeongnam—Kim’s strongholds—where he secured over 60% of the vote, propelled by the church’s organizational strength. This alignment of religious infrastructure with electoral strategy not only secured Kim’s presidency but also ushered in an era of Protestant political ascendancy. As sociologist Jung Tae-sik observes, Kim Young-sam and his evangelical allies “acted as a salvation aristocracy, using political means to achieve religious ends and embedding evangelical absolutism within state governance”.\n\nUltimately, Kim Young-sam’s presidency symbolized the apex of Protestant political influence in modern Korean history. It marked a new phase in church-state relations—one where “megachurches no longer avoided politics but claimed a rightful place in national leadership”. Through Kim’s rise, the Protestant church transformed from a religious community into a political actor, institutionalizing its voice within Korea’s democratic landscape.\n\n\n김수환 추기경 金壽煥 Stephen Kim Sou-hwan\n\n07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan remained a beacon of moral leadership in South Korea, steering his influence toward reconciliation, economic justice, and interfaith solidarity during a time of national transformation. Following his pivotal role in the democratization movement of the 1980s, Kim continued his public advocacy, grounded in a theology of human dignity and social responsibility.\n\nOne of the most significant and symbolic acts of the decade occurred during the 1997–1998 Asian Financial Crisis. In a period marked by widespread economic despair, rising unemployment, and national debt, the South Korean government launched a campaign to collect gold from the public to repay the country’s $58 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund. Cardinal Kim, then approaching the end of his official tenure as Archbishop of Seoul, donated his gold pectoral cross—the sacred item he received during his episcopal ordination—to this campaign. His act, widely publicized, became a national symbol of solidarity, inspiring many others to contribute personal belongings to help restore the economy.\n\nBeyond economic justice, Cardinal Kim also took bold steps toward inter-Korean reconciliation. In 1995, he established the Committee for the Reconciliation of the Korean People within the Archdiocese of Seoul. This committee launched a weekly “Reconciliation Mass” at Myeongdong Cathedral, where prayers were offered for North Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. These liturgies were accompanied by humanitarian outreach efforts, including food aid and pastoral letters urging Catholics to remember and assist their brethren in the North. His public statements emphasized that true peace could not be achieved by political or military means alone but must begin with the spiritual conversion of hearts and national empathy.\n\nEven as he prepared for retirement, Cardinal Kim remained an active force in shaping public values. In 1998, after serving three decades as Archbishop of Seoul, he became Archbishop Emeritus. Rather than withdrawing from public life, he used his retirement to engage more freely in civic and interreligious initiatives. Notably, he prioritized interreligious dialogue with Buddhist, Protestant, and Confucian leaders. Joint statements and community service projects were launched in partnership with these faith groups, particularly in response to social issues such as poverty, urban alienation, and the moral crisis following rapid modernization.\n\nThroughout the decade, Cardinal Kim continued to speak out against injustice. Though South Korea had transitioned to civilian government, many structural injustices remained, including labor exploitation and social inequality. Kim regularly issued pastoral messages and held press conferences denouncing the suppression of union activities and advocating for the humane treatment of workers. His unwavering commitment to human rights earned him continued respect, especially among labor groups, university students, and grassroots movements.\n\nCardinal Kim’s influence extended beyond religious boundaries. His funeral in 2009 was attended by national leaders from all faiths and political spectrums, but it was in the 1990s that his public image was firmly established as “the conscience of the nation.” His ability to combine deep Catholic spirituality with concrete social action made him one of the most revered figures of modern Korea.\n\n\n함세웅 신부 咸世雄 Se-woong Ham\n\n06/28/1942 ~ Present\n\n\nFather Ham Se-woong (baptismal name: Augustine) was a leading Catholic priest and one of the most symbolic religious figures in South Korea's democratization movement. Throughout the 1990s, even after the end of military rule in 1987, he remained active both inside and outside the Church, emphasizing social justice, reconciliation, and ecclesiastical renewal. His activities in this decade can be understood in four major domains: his continued social movement engagement, his reformist efforts within the Catholic Church, his public speeches and writings, and his overseas and ecumenical solidarity initiatives.\n\nIn terms of social movements, Father Ham was widely regarded as a moral authority in post-authoritarian civil society. He played a critical role in founding and supporting the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities, which focused on revealing and redressing pro-Japanese collaboration during the colonial period. This involvement was part of a broader effort by civil society actors to restore historical justice and national identity in the wake of democratization. In 1993, he also co-chaired the \"Council of Religious Leaders for Reconciliation and Peace,\" a coalition of leaders from various religions that worked for inter-Korean reconciliation through civil and religious diplomacy. His participation represented an attempt to broaden the democratic movement into one of national healing and unity across ideological lines.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Father Ham assumed leadership roles in several civic and political reform coalitions. He became co-chair of the \"National Alliance for Democratic Reform\" in 1998 and the \"National Political Research Association\" in 1999, both of which supported progressive democratic reforms under the Kim Dae-jung administration. Despite the transition to civilian government, he insisted that democratization remained an unfinished task, stating that civic organizations and religious leaders must continue to hold political power accountable and advocate for marginalized groups.\n\nWithin the Catholic Church, Father Ham remained a reformer committed to the spirit of Vatican II. As a professor at the Catholic University of Korea (1974–1992), he trained future priests in socially engaged theology. He argued that the Church should be a prophetic voice against structural injustice, not an institution of comfort. In 1996, he helped launch the \"Gaudium et Spes Pastoral Institute\" to promote theological renewal rooted in liberation theology. He believed that the priesthood was not just a sacramental office but a vocation of solidarity with the poor.\n\nIn the 1994 controversy over statements by Father Park Hong, then president of Sogang University, who claimed radical leftist groups were infiltrating college campuses, Father Ham publicly condemned such red-baiting rhetoric. He and the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) denounced the remarks as baseless ideological attacks, and the courts later ruled against Park Hong. This incident clearly illustrated the divide within the Catholic Church between progressives like Father Ham and more conservative clergy.\n\nFather Ham also spoke critically of the Church's declining role in democratic advocacy during the 1990s. He lamented that the Archdiocese of Seoul and figures like Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan became increasingly cautious, stating that \"when the Church ceases to stand with the suffering, it loses its prophetic calling and risks becoming an opiate.\"\n\nThrough interviews, sermons, and essays, Father Ham maintained a steady public presence. He published numerous books throughout the 1990s, including Jesus Who Came to Set Fire, Jesus Who Brought the Sword, Yoke and Cross: The Church's Role in Social Critique, and Why Be a Priest?. These writings provided theological justification for clergy involvement in struggles for justice, arguing that Jesus himself sided with the oppressed.\n\nHe consistently challenged the National Security Law, calling it an \"idolatrous law that sows fear and division\" and criticizing those who defended it as guilty of moral blindness. His rhetoric, though sometimes controversial, remained grounded in Catholic social teaching and liberation theology.\n\nWhile his main activities remained domestic, Father Ham also engaged in international solidarity efforts. Through his leadership in interfaith councils, he helped facilitate dialogue with Korean diaspora communities and religious groups in Japan and the United States. During the North Korean famine in the mid-1990s, he led fundraising campaigns among Catholic parishes and advocated for humanitarian aid as a moral imperative. He called on religious leaders to prioritize shared humanity over Cold War ideologies.\n\nFather Ham often cited Brazilian Archbishop Helder Camara as a major influence. Camara’s maxim, \"When I feed the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist,\" shaped Father Ham's vision of a prophetic Church that demands both charity and structural change.\n\nIn sum, Father Ham Se-woong’s activities in the 1990s illustrate his enduring commitment to a faith that serves the people. He bridged the gap between street-level activism and theological reflection, becoming a symbol of Korea’s moral conscience. Even after democratization, he believed the role of clergy was not to retreat but to deepen the Church’s mission in solidarity with the oppressed. His example inspired a new generation of socially conscious religious leaders who viewed justice as integral to discipleship.\n\n\n하용조  河用祚 Yong-jo Ha\n\n09/20/1946 ~ 08/02/2011\n\n\nHa Yong-jo's ministry in the 1990s, its significance, and historical context represent a key theological and pastoral development that emerged during a transformative period in the Korean church. He is especially noted for the growth of Onnuri Church, the establishment of a missional church model, and his embodiment of “Reformed Life Theology”. The 1990s marked a period when Korean Protestantism began to decline after decades of rapid growth. Until the 1980s, the church had enjoyed explosive expansion, but criticisms against patriarchal pastoral structures, disillusionment with authoritarian leadership, and broader democratic and globalizing social currents began influencing Korean Christianity. Middle-class believers increasingly desired liber Ibid.ation from rigid, hierarchical church cultures. From 1995 to 2005, the number of Protestant adherents declined by 1.6%, while Catholicism rose by 74.4% and Buddhism by 3.9%. Amid this overall decline, Onnuri Church experienced phenomenal growth.\n\nFounded in 1985 by Pastor Ha Yong-jo, Onnuri Church expanded rapidly during the 1990s, establishing a wide range of ministries. He reorganized the traditional church model through small-group-based worship communities, open praise and sermon-centered worship, and the empowerment of lay leadership. Based on a worship experience in England, he envisioned a Spirit-filled church like that in the Acts of the Apostles, recalling that “people gathered tightly in a small chapel, raised their hands in praise, worship ran over an hour, and the congregation responded with applause and dance. The communion was full of tears and emotion”. Such worship enabled deep emotional and spiritual engagement.\n\nThere were five main reasons why Koreans responded so strongly to Onnuri Church’s model. First, it responded to the weariness many felt toward patriarchal churches and their longing for alternative communities. Traditional Korean churches were steeped in Confucian authority and development-era authoritarianism. Ha provided “religious alternative spaces” that allowed believers to subvert oppressive ecclesial norms. Second, it effectively combined cultural sensitivity with mass appeal. Unlike traditional worship, Onnuri’s format—where people raised hands, clapped, and wept together—allowed congregants to embody their faith through expressive action. Through John Fiske’s cultural theory, this phenomenon can be interpreted as believers reappropriating dominant codes to form their own symbolic religious practices. Third, it integrated media and educational ministries into everyday life. Onnuri Church launched CGNTV, Duranno Publishing, Onnuri Newspaper, and welfare foundations. The 1995 launch of the Duranno Father School, a program that redefined Christian masculinity and addressed family restoration, was a major success. These were not merely programs, but a lifestyle-centered gospel movement. Fourth, it empowered lay ministry and leadership. Onnuri trained lay leaders to run small groups, teach the Bible, and engage in missions. This shift from passive to active discipleship offered a new participatory model of the church, which contrasted sharply with top-down traditional models. Fifth, it projected a global vision. Guided by the motto “To the Ends of the Earth,” Ha Yong-jo planted campuses in Japan, the U.S., and Latin America, implementing a glocalized mission combining media and church planting. This vision appealed especially to younger generations with global identities.\n\nTheologically, Ha Yong-jo is seen as a practitioner of Reformed Life Theology, which emphasized not scholastic theology but the lived experience of faith. He declared, “Theology is not an academic discipline. The Word and the Spirit—these are the core of theology. Knowing God with the heart and praying on one’s knees while experiencing the Word—that is true theology”. This theology rejected detached abstraction and sought to unify experiential piety with biblical truth.\n\nHa’s work in the 1990s did not merely build a megachurch but restructured the entire pastoral and theological landscape of Korean Christianity. His efforts to establish a participatory, culturally relevant, and Spirit-led community laid the groundwork for many missional and megachurch models that followed. His legacy offers a clear direction for Korean church renewal: unity between worship and life, Scripture and culture, theology and spirituality.\n\n\n옥한흠 玉漢欽 Han-heum Oak\n\n12/05/1938 ~ 09/02/2010\n\n\nPastor Oak Han-heum’s ministry during the 1990s, its historical background, and significance can be understood as a decisive expression of pastoral leadership that led both the awakening of the laity and the reform of the church amid the structural crisis and theological confusion that began in the late 1980s in the Korean church. The 1990s marked a period when Korean churches, having reached the peak of quantitative growth, entered a phase of internal crisis marked by spiritual stagnation, authoritarian pastoral leadership, and growing conflicts and divisions within congregations. In this context, Pastor Oak initiated a dual strategy of \"discipleship ministry\" and \"church renewal through preaching,\" offering a turning point for the Korean church.\n\nFrom the founding of Sarang Church in 1978 into the 1990s, Oak Han-heum sought to transition the church's center from clergy to laypeople. He resisted the traditional authoritarian structures of church operation and emphasized that every believer was a bearer of apostolic succession, called to proclaim the gospel. He declared that “believers are all heirs of apostolicity…called to make disciples of all nations,” thereby positioning the laity not as passive recipients of ministry but as co-laborers in the work of the church. This vision deeply resonated with the self-development ethos of Korean society and took root not merely as a strategy for church growth but as a full reformation of the ecclesial structure.\n\nThis training-centered pastoral philosophy found fertile ground in Korea’s culture, which values education and diligence. Oak’s discipleship ministry motivated believers to pursue post-conversion life transformation through disciplined faith. He emphasized that “those saved must live as befits the people of God,” underlining the necessity of a holy calling as well as righteous identity. While Pastor Ha Yong-jo focused on emotional resonance and relational ministry through culturally open evangelism, Oak emphasized spiritual discipline and responsibility.\n\nIn the 1990s, Sarang Church extended beyond quantitative expansion and began solidifying a missional church model and theological ecclesiology. Oak did not regard the church as merely a place for worship, but as a missionary community called to be salt and light in the world. His discipleship ministry was not a program but a theological strategy to lead believers into holistic obedience to the gospel. He believed that “discipleship is the link that connects soteriology and ecclesiology,” and he rooted his ministry in a gospel-driven ecclesiology that positioned discipleship and sending as the very purpose of the church.\n\nHe also pursued the awakening and reformation of the Korean church through preaching. His sermons revolved around the key themes of ‘awakening’ and ‘reform,’ reinterpreting biblical truths in light of contemporary problems facing the church and society. While grounded in Reformed theology, he practiced a theology “for the church,” not as abstract theory but as pastoral reality. He came to be known as “the preacher who awakened the Korean church”. Above all, he believed that “preaching changes the church,” and practiced expository preaching as the foundation for nurturing believers. Oak’s leadership became even more distinctive in the 1990s. Unlike Ha Yong-jo, who cast visions and expanded ministry creatively, Oak was a reformer of ecclesial structures. He reorganized leadership itself by redesigning organizational, personnel, and training systems around verification and discipline. Ha promoted lay participation through small groups and media missions; Ok built lay leadership through rigorous training and qualification. He was not simply a program operator but a “practical reformer” who staked his ministry on transforming the church’s essence and structure.\n\nIn contrast to Ha Yong-jo, whose leadership emphasized freedom and cultural engagement, Oak insisted on training-verified discipleship. His concern was not only the participation of the laity but their transformation. He developed discipleship into a theological framework, not merely a ministry method. Oak “positioned discipleship as the bridge between soteriology and ecclesiology,” systematizing it into a theological-pastoral model that addressed the very nature of Christian salvation and church life³.\n\nIn conclusion, Pastor Oak Han-heum’s work in the 1990s was not just a strategy for church growth but a crucial contribution to the theological, institutional, and spiritual reconstruction of the Korean church. His ministry and preaching continue to be regarded as a “pastoral alternative for a church in crisis.” As a preacher, theologian, trainer, and ecclesial practitioner, he offered a multifaceted leadership and a systematic answer to the question of “how to reform the church.” As a result, the Korean church could envision transformation not only in outward growth but in becoming a mature and trained community of faith.\n\n\n김진홍  목사 金鎭洪 Jin-hong Kim\n\n06/18/1941 ~ Present\n\n\nPastor Jin-Hong Kim, a prominent Presbyterian (Tonghap) minister and social activist, began his ministry in the slums of Cheonggyecheon during the 1970s and carried that spirit into the 1990s. In the wake of South Korea’s democratization, the 1990s marked a period of ideological transformation and redefinition of public roles for religious institutions. Kim was a key figure in maintaining and reformulating Christian social engagement, particularly by continuing his urban poor and community-centered ministry while also becoming increasingly involved in conservative public discourse and national reform movements.\n\nDuring this decade, Kim continued his community-based ministry at Namyang Bay’s Dure Village, where he had relocated with evicted Cheonggyecheon residents in 1976. The community featured agricultural cooperatives and Christian communal life rooted in land cultivation and economic self-reliance. He once described the move as “a modern-day Exodus,” portraying himself as a Korean version of Moses.\n\nIn 1996, Kim took part in the civic committee to address issues faced by ethnic Koreans in China, particularly North Korean defectors and the Korean-Chinese diaspora. This initiative signaled the Korean church's growing attention to human rights beyond national borders. The following year, in March 1997, Kim moved his ministry from Namyang to Guri, founding what became known as Guri Dure Church. It attracted long-time followers from his previous ministries and rapidly expanded, laying the foundation for what would become one of Korea’s notable socially active churches.\n\nDuring the 1997–98 Asian Financial Crisis, Kim joined the National Movement for the Second Founding of the Republic, a campaign led by various civic, religious, and political figures aimed at restoring national integrity and morality. As a Christian leader, he emphasized personal sacrifice, economic discipline, and the need for spiritual renewal. This period also marked the publication of several influential books by Kim, including Successful Reform, Failed Reform (1996) and Even If You Fall Next to a Trash Can (1998), in which he blended personal testimony with commentary on Korean society’s ethical decline. His works resonated widely, establishing him as both a spiritual and social voice.\n\nWhile his early career had aligned with progressive Christian activism, by the late 1990s, Kim began articulating more conservative theological and economic views. He famously remarked, “After God, money is most important,” and argued that capitalism was “the child of biblical ethics”. These views sparked both admiration and criticism, particularly from theologians and Christians rooted in minjung theology and liberation traditions. Reflecting on his past, Kim once said, “I was neither a democrat nor an activist—I was just imprisoned by accident,” distancing himself from the progressive camp. Nonetheless, he also claimed, “I, too, once protested for democratization,” highlighting the contradictions within his evolving stance.\n\nHis trajectory ultimately laid the foundation for his leadership role in the New Right movement in the early 2000s, but the ideological seeds had already been planted in his 1990s work. In this respect, Kim helped redirect Korean Protestant social engagement from progressive anti-authoritarianism toward a morally driven conservatism. His presence in both civic and church circles exemplified the role of clergy as public intellectuals during Korea’s post-democratic transition.\n\n\n조화순 목사 Hwa-soon Jo\n\n1934 ~ Present\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Reverend Jo Hwa-soon emerged as one of the most pioneering female pastors and popular movement leaders in South Korea. The church she built was not merely a space for worship—it became a living site where residents, workers, and women pursued liberation. Beginning her ministry at Dalwol Church in Siheung, her pastoral work was grounded in the belief that \"the church is the community,\" a conviction that naturally expanded into broader social movements.\n\nTo Reverend Jo, the church was not confined to its walls: “I don’t believe God only dwells inside the church. I think everyone in the local community is a church member.” She engaged directly in the lives of her neighbors—attending weddings and funerals even of non-congregants, contributing condolence or congratulatory funds as a sign of solidarity. In Dalhyeon-ri, elderly residents affectionately called her “our pastor.” When she was once arrested, they sang hymns outside the detention center demanding her release.\n\nWithin the church, Jo fought to elevate the institutional status of female pastors. As President of the Korean Methodist Church’s National Association of Women Pastors, she led reforms that allowed married women to continue pastoral ministry, thereby institutionalizing gender equity in church leadership. She firmly believed that “true faith is enduring to the end,” and she maintained that churches must stand with the powerless in society.\n\nBeyond the church, she was a symbolic figure in South Korea’s labor and democratization movements. While working with the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission from 1966, she labored alongside female factory workers in places like Dong-il Textile Company. Through Bible studies, knitting circles, and flower arrangement clubs, she helped raise consciousness and solidarity among women workers. These efforts led to the historic election of a female union leader at Dong-il—a landmark moment in the history of Korea’s labor movement. Yet the journey was fraught with hardship. In 1978, the infamous “feces incident” occurred, where male workers assaulted female unionists and doused them with excrement. Jo, after delivering public lectures condemning the violence, was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year.\n\nIn the 1990s, she stepped into a more institutionalized form of women’s activism. Serving as the Chair of the Korean Women’s Associations United, she defined femininity as “a warm embrace that comforts others, and the courage to confront injustice.” Her leadership helped define the direction of Christian feminism and bridged the divide between women’s rights activism and the progressive church.\n\nHer influence extended beyond religious or activist circles. In one notable episode, she proposed organizing a public forum in Siheung, inviting the mayor to engage directly with church members on local issues. “Let the officials come to where the believers are, and let us speak to them about Siheung’s problems,” she suggested. This event, held within the church, functioned as a model of civic participation and reflected her view that churches should be centers of local democracy.\n\nJo Hwa-soon’s activities were not merely the passionate work of one pastor. They embodied a lived theology that integrated gospel and justice, women and the people. Her legacy defined a new identity for the Korean clergy—as public theologian, feminist activist, and community organizer.\n\n\n박형규 목사 朴炯圭 Hyung-kyu Park\n\n08/25/1923 ~ 08/18/2016\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Rev. Hyung-Kyu Park’s activities reflected a continuation of his lifelong commitment to embodying the social responsibility of the Church and public engagement of Christian faith. As South Korea transitioned into a consolidated democracy, Park channeled his theological convictions into shaping the moral direction of civil society, guiding student and urban poor movements, and seeking regional reconciliation and peace in East Asia. One of the most symbolic events of this decade was his six-year outdoor worship protest in front of the Seoul Jungbu Police Station, held from 1984 to December 1990. After being forcibly ousted from Seoul Jeil Church due to government pressure and internal conflict, Park began worshipping in the street. This act became a powerful expression of ecclesial freedom and resistance. He declared it “the largest church in the world with the sky as its ceiling and no walls,” making it a living embodiment of the persecuted church.\n\nEven after the military regime gave way to a civilian government, Park warned that the Church must not become complacent. Inspired by Karl Barth’s imperative to “let the Church be the Church,” Park remained critical of the Church’s tendency to side with power or capital. He proclaimed that “even when democracy is institutionalized, the children of light must still rise to resist the forces of darkness”. He believed the Church must speak prophetically in every age, not merely during dictatorship.\n\nIn the 1990s, Park intensified his focus on urban poor ministries and the theological reconfiguration of the minjung (people’s) movement. Drawing from the “Missio Dei” (Mission of God) paradigm, he redefined mission as the liberating work of God in the world—not a function of church expansion or personal salvation alone. He stressed that the true subject of mission is God, and the church is a tool for realizing comprehensive salvation encompassing political, economic, and social liberation. To this end, Park adopted Saul Alinsky’s community organizing methods and Paulo Freire’s conscientization strategies to strengthen grassroots urban movements. Moreover, Park remained a vital mentor in Christian student movements and the second generation of minjung theology. As honorary advisor of the Korean Christian Student Federation (KSCF), which he had helped establish in 1969, Park encouraged a generation of students to develop a faith-based public vocation. His “GO–LOOK–ACT” strategy, developed through the Haksa-dan (Student Social Development Group), continued to guide students toward involvement in issues such as labor, reunification, and environmental justice. Park also played a leading role in reconciliation and peace initiatives between Korean and Japanese churches. In the mid-1990s, he facilitated the partnership between Seoul Jeil Church and Nishikatamachi Church in Japan, promoting historical reconciliation and Christian fellowship beyond national boundaries. This model of cross-national church communion offered a theological vision for East Asian peace rooted in repentance, forgiveness, and shared faith.\n\nThroughout the decade, Park emphasized that the 1990s were not merely the fruit of past struggles but a new beginning. “Faith means facing the darkness of our times and opening a new path within it,” he declared, urging the Church to remain prophetic and engaged. Thus, his work in the 1990s represented not only a continuation of resistance but a reimagining of the Church’s vocation in a democratizing society.\n\n\n이은선  Un Sunn Lee\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Lee Un-sun actively advanced a uniquely Korean feminist theology, seeking to reconstruct theological discourse by integrating East Asian intellectual traditions. She criticized the male-centered and individualistic aspects of Christian soteriology and proposed a “theology of life-giving spirituality,” grounded in everyday female embodiment and Confucian self-cultivation. Rather than passively adopting Western feminist theology, she restructured it within the Korean cultural and spiritual context.\n\nDrawing on Confucian ideals—such as the Way of the Sage (聖人之道), sympathetic heart (惻隱之心), and the unity of all beings (萬物一體)—Lee reformulated salvation theology as a threefold structure: Seong (聖, creativity/transcendence), Seong (性, femininity/otherness), and Seong (誠, sincerity/political ethics). This expanded the concept of salvation beyond the soul’s redemption to a communal vision of transformation, beginning with moral cultivation (修身) and extending to familial harmony, social reform, and ecological solidarity. For Lee, “the sage, who internalizes transcendence through self-cultivation, is the theological agent in the biosphere era.”\n\nShe introduced saengmul (生物, living beings) as a concept surpassing saengmyeong (生命, life), to highlight the relational, creative, and nurturing nature of existence. Her definition of sympathy emphasized that “sympathy must not end in feeling with, but must lead to doing with,” stressing action-based solidarity rooted in empathy. This concept of sympathy—central to her feminist theology—was simultaneously theological and political, emphasizing that divine love is realized through embodied solidarity and communal care. A key articulation of this vision appeared in her 1993 article, “On the Necessity and Meaning of the Encounter between Confucianism and Christianity,” where she argued that both traditions shared a moral and spiritual foundation that could enrich each other in Korean theological thought. She asserted that Christianity’s message of agape and Confucianism’s 仁 (ren) were not contradictory but mutually illuminating. By constructing a theological bridge between the two, she challenged dualistic thinking and asserted a contextual Korean theology of relational salvation.\n\nIn 1997, she expanded this vision in her seminal monograph Postmodern Korean Feminist Theology. There, she argued that Korean feminist theology must move beyond Western feminist assumptions—particularly their focus on individualism and secularism—and instead be rooted in the spiritual, ethical, and communal lifeworld of Korean women. She proposed the Seong·Seong·Seong (聖·性·誠) model as a new theological grammar that integrates transcendence, embodied femininity, and public ethics. Salvation, she claimed, is not only liberation from sin but a “life-giving transformation” of all relationships—self, household, society, and nature.\n\nIn 1998, Lee applied these theological insights in a more public-facing theological reflection titled “Shalom—Sex is No Longer Destiny.” There, she boldly declared that gender roles are not divine mandates but human constructs shaped by patriarchy. “To say that sex is no longer destiny,” she wrote, “is to declare the restoration of human subjectivity and the image of God within every woman.” She called on the Korean church to renounce gender fatalism and to embrace a vision of shalom—a peace rooted in justice, equality, and mutual flourishing.\n\nLee’s feminist theology, shaped in the crucible of Korea’s Confucian-Christian context, rejected both patriarchal conservatism and uncritical Western imports. Instead, she forged an alternative rooted in embodied spirituality, ecological awareness, and ethical interdependence. Her work was quickly taken up as a foundational framework in the Korean Women’s Theological Society, where her bridging of Confucianism and Christianity enabled a new wave of indigenous theological reflection.\n\nThrough these writings, Lee not only challenged the structures of domination embedded in theology but also invited a renewed vision of salvation—as a communal, ecological, and justice-oriented practice. Her vision of “a transformative big bang of salvation beginning with one woman and one household” became emblematic of Korean feminist theology’s most profound aspirations.\n\n\n이재철 목사 Jae-chul Lee\n\n1949 ~ Present\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Pastor Jae-Chul Lee's ministry marked a concrete embodiment of practical theology that challenged prevailing paradigms in the Korean Protestant church. From the outset of his pastoral journey, when he planted The Lord’s Church in the auditorium of a high school in Songpa, Seoul, in 1988, he set a countercultural tone by declaring a self-imposed 10-year term limit on his pastoral leadership. True to this promise, he stepped down in 1998, stating that a pastor should be \"not a wage earner, but a person of calling.\" This act, rare in a church culture dominated by life-long appointments and personal control over congregations, symbolized his theological conviction that authority in the church must be bounded, accountable, and sacrificial.\n\nOne of Lee’s most innovative practices was his adoption of expository sequential preaching (순서설교), in which he preached verse by verse through entire books of the Bible, beginning with the Gospel of John. At a time when most Korean churches favored topical and emotionally driven sermons, this method invited congregants to engage deeply with the structure and flow of Scripture. “Even churchgoers who only attend on Sundays will, over time, understand the Bible more holistically,” Lee emphasized, noting that such preaching “allows God’s Word to lead both the preacher and the church.” This method was not merely pedagogical—it was theological: a commitment to the integrity of Scripture as the foundation of the Christian life.\n\nAfter resigning from The Lord’s Church, Lee continued to exercise his theological convictions through writing and speaking. In works like Young Man, Sow Even If You Weep (1998) and Discard the Distorted Gospel (2003), he offered a pointed critique of Korean Christianity’s obsession with prosperity, numerical growth, and institutional power. “The greatest ailments of the Korean church are materialism, prosperity-seeking, and self-centeredness,” he wrote, arguing that such distortions “stand in direct contradiction to the way of Jesus.” His voice gained moral weight because it was not merely prophetic but lived—he had already renounced institutional power and popularity in his own ministry.\n\nIn 2002, Lee was invited to serve as the senior pastor of the Korean Church Centennial Memorial Church (100th Anniversary Memorial Church), a flagship church within the Korean ecumenical tradition. He served there until 2015, when, in another historic move, he appointed four pastors to succeed him as co-pastors. “A church cannot be healthy unless power is shared,” Lee declared. The decision was both theological and structural, designed to resist the monopolization of authority and encourage communal discernment in church leadership. It was the first time in Korean church history that a megachurch transitioned into a collegial pastoral model without conflict.\n\nThrough these actions, Lee demonstrated that pastoral ministry must embody theological convictions at every level—spiritual, ethical, institutional, and relational. In a church culture shaped by hierarchical authority, market-driven expansion, and celebrity leadership, his choices modeled a theology of humility, community, and trust in God’s Word. Lee’s ministry in the 1990s thus stands not merely as a critique of the status quo, but as a working proposal for what the church could become when it truly believes that the Kingdom of God is already among us.\n\n\n김영길  金永吉 Young-gil Kim\n\n10/03/1939 ~ 06/30/2019\n\n\nDr. Young-Gil Kim was a South Korean engineer and educator who founded Handong Global University and served as its first president. His life and achievements represent a rare synthesis of technological expertise and a Christian educational philosophy rooted in moral character and global engagement.\n\nBorn in 1939 in Jiryedong, Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Kim graduated from the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at Seoul National University. He earned a master’s degree in metallurgical engineering from the University of Missouri and a Ph.D. in materials science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in New York. During his years in the United States, he worked as a researcher at NASA’s Lewis Research Center and the International Nickel Company (INCO), where he contributed to the development of high-temperature alloys for jet engines. In 1979, he returned to South Korea to join the faculty of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) as a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, where he devoted himself to scientific advancement and the training of Korea’s next generation of engineers.\n\nIn 1995, Kim established Handong Global University in Pohang, Gyeongbuk, and became its inaugural president. The university, from its inception, aimed to be a Christian institution devoted to holistic education and internationalization. Despite numerous initial challenges—including financial hardship and local resistance—Kim's leadership guided the institution to become one of South Korea's most innovative universities. Notably, Handong was selected in 2007 as a host university for UNESCO’s UNITWIN program and designated in 2011 as a global hub of the United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI) initiative. Kim envisioned Handong as a space for character formation grounded in Christian values. Students were educated to live with honesty, responsibility, and love, and the school emphasized a strong ethical foundation through programs like the honor system and unproctored conscience exams.\n\nKim worked to embody his Christian faith in his educational philosophy. In 1981, he co-founded the Korea Association for Creation Research and served as its first president. Through Handong, he championed values-based education that fostered not only academic achievement but also compassion and service. He famously promoted the motto, “Study to give it away,” encouraging students to become altruistic and mission-oriented leaders.\n\nAs a scientist, Kim left a remarkable legacy. His research on superalloys for jet engines led to NASA awarding him the Tech Briefs Award in both 1976 and 1981. He also received the IR-100 Award for industrial innovation in 1981. After returning to Korea, he led the development of PMC-102, a high-performance alloy for semiconductor lead frames, which became Korea’s first export of high-tech materials to an advanced industrial nation. As an educator and leader, he served in various capacities including president of the Accreditation Board for Engineering Education of Korea (ABEEK), chairman of the Korean Council for University Education, and president of the Korean Association of Private University Presidents, influencing national policy in higher education.\n\n\n ",
