This was not merely a dispute over institutional reform but rather a comprehensive reflection of theological identity, biblical interpretation methods, and perspectives on female leadership within the church.\n\nIn 1994, the PCK Tonghap officially approved female ordination at its 79th General Assembly, with 701 votes in favor, 612 against, and 8 abstentions. The following year, the constitutional amendment was finalized through presbytery-level ratification, allowing women to sit for the ordination examination beginning in 1996. That autumn, 19 women became the first officially ordained female ministers within the denomination. This marked the culmination of over sixty years of petitions and deliberations, dating back to the 1933 request for female elders. Meanwhile, the PCK Hapdong strongly opposed the decision. It reaffirmed its opposition to female ordination in its journal Shinhak Jinam in 1996 and 1997 and reiterated this position at its 83rd General Assembly in 1998. Although some limited measures were discussed—such as granting female missionaries temporary sacramental authority or acknowledging calls for female military chaplains—the denomination maintained its rejection of female ministerial ordination.\n\nAt the core of this debate lay a theological clash between egalitarianism and complementarianism. Egalitarians cited Genesis 1:27 (“male and female He created them in the image of God”) and Galatians 3:28 (“there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus”) as central affirmations that women could rightfully exercise leadership in the church. They also called for critical, historical-contextual interpretation of Pauline prohibitions such as 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 and 1 Timothy 2:12. Notably, New Testament scholar Seyoon Kim argued that the passage in 1 Corinthians 14 was a later interpolation and should not be viewed as reflecting Paul’s original stance on women. By contrast, complementarians asserted a divinely ordained distinction between male and female roles, especially in church leadership. Wayne Grudem argued that Scripture consistently prohibits women from holding office as pastors or elders, affirming that “the consistent position of the church throughout history has been to reserve such offices for men.” He viewed this not as a culturally contingent norm, but as rooted in the created order. Korean theologian Park Hyung-ryong similarly maintained that Paul's teachings represented a universal and timeless truth applicable to all churches, not merely to local contexts.\n\nThis clash extended beyond exegesis to deeper theological debates concerning anthropology, ecclesiology, and even divine ontology. Linda Belleville, an advocate of egalitarianism, accused complementarianism of entrenching patriarchal authority structures and reinforcing gender-based hierarchies in the name of tradition. In response, complementarians warned that egalitarianism imported secular ideologies into the church, thereby weakening the authority of Scripture and destabilizing the ordained church order.\n\nThe decision by the PCK Tonghap to ordain women was not confined to internal policy but resonated widely across Korean society. Women’s organizations and progressive media outlets welcomed it as a breakthrough against patriarchal religious structures. Women’s News praised the shift, declaring that “a church without women in ministry is no longer imaginable.”\n\nConservative Christian media and leaders, however, expressed fierce opposition. The Christian Bulletin (Kidosinbo) denounced the decision as “a humanistic move that destroys the order of Scripture,” and some congregations even launched petition campaigns to reverse the change. The PCK Hapdong continued to uphold its complementarian stance, reiterating in 1998 that female evangelists may be honored but not ordained.\n\nWhile this debate initiated institutional reforms, many challenges persisted. Although women could now be ordained in the PCK Tonghap, they faced structural limitations in practice. Very few female pastors secured senior pastor positions or influential roles in presbytery leadership. Theologian Seo Young-im observed that “the number of ordained women increased steadily, but most served in assistant roles or specialized ministries,” and “the male-dominated structure of the church remained deeply entrenched.” In response, women ministers began to form collective networks to address these structural challenges. Organizations such as the Korean Association of Women Pastors and the National Council of Women Ministers emerged to advocate for leadership development, combat discrimination, and enhance public perceptions of female pastors. At the same time, scholars like Jung Mi-hyun, Oh Sung-choon, and Choi Young-shil advanced feminist theological critiques of male-centered ecclesiology and biblical language. The issue also gained international visibility. Global ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Presbyterian Church (USA) highlighted Korea’s ordination reform as a leading case among Asian churches. The PCK Tonghap gained recognition for integrating female leadership into its denominational structure. Nevertheless, many conservative denominations—including the PCK Hapdong and the Kosin Church—continued to reject female ordination on the grounds that ecclesiastical offices must follow the divinely instituted order. This divide has created ongoing theological rifts within Korean Protestantism and continues to impede interdenominational cooperation in areas such as social engagement, ecumenical work, and joint missions.\n\nUltimately, the debate over women’s ordination in 1990s Korea was more than a policy dispute; it was a watershed moment that exposed deep tensions in theology, gender ideology, and institutional power. The conflict between egalitarian and complementarian frameworks continues to shape Korean ecclesial identity and structure to this day.\n\n\nNew Apostolic Reformation (NAR)\n\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the Korean church was confronted with the growing spread of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), prompting strong responses from various conservative denominations and theologians. These disputes were not merely differences in theological interpretation or cultural practice, but rather structural confrontations involving the authority of Scripture, the cessation of divine revelation, the nature of ecclesial polity, and the essence of worship.\n\nNAR advocates claimed that the offices of apostles and prophets should be restored in the modern church and that they must exercise the highest authority over ecclesial leadership. Through apostolic governance and prophetic revelation, they asserted their role in determining the direction of the church, bypassing traditional denominational systems. Moreover, phenomena such as falling, trembling, gold dust, “glory clouds,” and miraculous healings were framed as essential manifestations of God’s presence in worship. These features clashed sharply with the principles of sola scriptura and the cessationist tradition upheld by conservative Reformed theology.\n\nIn 1995, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) passed a resolution to prohibit the introduction of the Vineyard Movement, citing its overemphasis on sensory and mystical experiences that threatened to distort the essence of Christian worship. The Vineyard Movement promoted phenomena such as prophecy, healing, and emotional outbursts (e.g., laughter, crying, falling), which were seen as undermining the traditional liturgical order.\n\nIn 2007, the Kosin General Assembly declared NAR teachings to be “extremely unsound doctrine” and prohibited the reading of related literature, the invitation of NAR-affiliated speakers, and participation in related gatherings. The Kosin denomination saw NAR as promoting extra-biblical revelation, dismantling orthodox theology, and disrupting the established ecclesial order.\n\nIn 2009, the Hapdong denomination officially labeled NAR teachings as heretical and adopted a resolution banning all participation and fellowship. The denomination criticized the NAR for creating a new spiritual hierarchy within the church and undermining the closed canon of Scripture by elevating apostolic and prophetic utterances above biblical authority. In addition to these theological concerns, all three denominations expressed alarm at how the movement's emphasis on autonomous experience and subjective authority bypassed denominational discipline and encouraged division among congregations.\n\nThese responses were not based on surface-level disagreement but stemmed from a deeply rooted conviction that the NAR posed a fundamental threat to the theological identity, liturgical order, and public authority of the Korean church. Even today, the boundaries established during the 1990s continue to serve as critical guardrails in Korean evangelical theology.\n\n\nTable.

Each stream grappled with its own internal crises while engaging in broader debates about church identity, theological integrity, and growth. These interactions generated both innovation and fragmentation in the theological landscape of the Korean church.\n\nConservative theology, particularly represented by denominations such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (PCK, Hapdong and Kosin), sought to maintain the legacy of Reformed orthodoxy rooted in the Westminster Confession. However, facing stagnation in church growth, some conservative theologians initiated a turn toward evangelicalism. This movement, as exemplified by figures like Park Yun-sun, maintained biblical inerrancy while emphasizing gospel-centered preaching. Yet this transition also blurred boundaries with revivalism and pragmatic church-growth ideologies, raising concerns about theological dilution.\n\nLiberal theology, primarily affiliated with the Methodist Church, entered a period of self-criticism. The decline in church vitality and social influence prompted some within the tradition to adopt more evangelical elements or to seek new relevance through practical ministry. However, this shift sparked intense conflict. In some instances, liberal theologians were even expelled from their denominations for perceived doctrinal deviation. While liberal theology had historically emphasized reason, experience, and pluralism, it now faced a credibility crisis amid calls for biblical fidelity and ecclesial renewal.\n\nProgressive theology, as developed by the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (PROK), retained its focus on contextual and socially engaged theology, particularly through the legacy of Minjung Theology. The 1990s witnessed attempts to expand this framework into ecological, cultural, and postcolonial directions. Yet progressive theology also faced diminished mass appeal and internal debates about its political alignment, leading to reflection on how to balance prophetic engagement with ecclesial sustainability.\n\nEvangelical theology became the most influential theological movement of the decade. Emphasizing scriptural authority, personal conversion, and mission, it was adopted across denominational lines. However, in Korea, evangelicalism was increasingly intertwined with pragmatism and prosperity theology. Large churches adopted growth-centered strategies and spiritualized material success, resulting in widespread criticism of the commercialization of faith and the loss of theological depth.\n\n\nTable. Theological Movements in 1990s\n\n| Theological Stream | Key 1990s Trends | Debates and Struggles | Significance and Impact |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservatism | Shift toward evangelicalism | Confusion between fundamentalism and renewal | Emphasis on gospel-centered preaching; need for theological reform |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Liberalism | Decline and partial evangelical adoption | Doctrinal conflicts and expulsions | Recognition of liberal limits; some move toward evangelically grounded praxis |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Progressivism | Expansion of Minjung theology | Crisis of relevance and internal critique | Continued social critique; reduced influence in church growth metrics |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Evangelicalism | Rise and eventual distortion | Prosperity theology and superficiality | Mass appeal with theological shallowness; criticism of commodified Christianity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nExpansion of Christian Heresies\n\n\nThe 1990s marked a dramatic turning point in South Korea’s religious landscape, as numerous Christian heretical movements—most notably JMS, Shincheonji, the Church of God, and the Guwonpa (Salvation Sect)—expanded their reach and visibility. Amidst rapid modernization and social unrest, particularly during the 1997–98 IMF crisis, these groups capitalized on spiritual confusion, dissatisfaction with institutional churches, and eschatological fears to attract vulnerable populations, especially youth and women.\n\nJMS (Jesus Morning Star), led by Jung Myung-seok, emerged from the Unification Church and rapidly expanded in the 1990s through university-based recruiting. Jung’s strategy involved establishing pseudo-student clubs and cultural organizations centered on cheerleading, dance, modeling, and sports to attract elite university students. Despite growing social criticism following the 1999 “Hwangyang Abduction Case” and televised investigative reports, JMS maintained its organizational coherence. It continued to appeal to youth through seemingly harmless activities that concealed its indoctrination process and veneration of Jung as a messianic figure.\n\nShincheonji, founded in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, initiated aggressive expansion strategies in the 1990s through free Bible centers, disguised theological schools, and infiltration of traditional churches. The group implemented a step-by-step recruitment system, beginning with assessing “ignorance,” attacking mainstream churches, gradually teaching Shincheonji doctrine, and finally revealing the true identity of the group. Lee was presented as the only mediator of salvation, and scripture was interpreted allegorically to reinforce exclusivist beliefs. The group employed tactics such as “harvest workers” to sow division within congregations and replace leadership from within.\n\nThe World Mission Society Church of God, formerly known as the Ahn Sahng-Hong Witnesses, also gained prominence during this period. After the failed prophecy of Ahn’s return in 1988, the group continued to promote doomsday messages such as the 1997 and 1999 end-time claims. They emphasized observance of Saturday Sabbath and the Passover, rejected Christmas and Easter as pagan rituals, and revered both Ahn and his spiritual “bride,” Jang Gil-ja, as divine figures. Their proselytization often took the form of door-to-door surveys targeting Christian homes, where doctrinal critiques led to persistent invitations to Bible studies.\n\nThe Guwonpa (Salvation Sect), particularly under Park Ok-soo, posed a distinct challenge due to its claim to affirm biblical authority while deviating significantly from orthodox soteriology. Emphasizing one-time “realization-based” salvation, Park downplayed repentance and ethical transformation, attracting many through the promise of absolute assurance. During the 1990s, this sect actively targeted high school and university students with youth camps and charismatic teaching events, promoting the image of being more spiritually “pure” than mainstream churches.\n\nAdditionally, the infamous 1992 failed prophecy by Dami Mission, which predicted the rapture in October of that year, caused national hysteria and became a turning point in public awareness of end-times heresies. Many groups, including the Church of God and Guwonpa, recycled similar eschatological claims to maintain urgency among followers. The Unification Church, while institutionally stabilized by the 1990s, continued to serve as a doctrinal foundation for derivative groups such as JMS.\n\nThis period also witnessed the failure of traditional churches to adequately respond. Theological illiteracy among laypeople, institutional corruption, and pastoral authoritarianism created fertile ground for sectarian infiltration. Many churches only began confronting the problem after experiencing internal disruption. Consequently, several denominations issued formal heresy declarations only in the mid-1990s, lagging behind the rapid expansion of these groups.\n\nSociologically, Korea’s religious environment—marked by syncretism, Shamanistic tendencies, and pragmatic spiritualism—also contributed to the appeal of heretical movements. Their emotional intensity, prophetic claims, and promises of certainty offered an alternative to bureaucratized and disenchanted institutional religion. For many youth and marginalized individuals, these groups represented not just theological alternatives but communities of belonging and purpose.\n\nIn sum, the 1990s represent a critical era in which Korean Christian heresies grew both in complexity and social impact. Their strategies became increasingly intelligent, their teachings more theologically radical, and their outreach more targeted. This decade laid the foundation for their continued presence in the 21st century and underscored the urgent need for doctrinal education and spiritual discernment within the Korean church.\n\n\n Rapture Prediction Incident in 1992\n\n\nOn October 28, 1992, South Korea witnessed an unprecedented outbreak of rapture hysteria, incited by a fringe Christian movement known as the Mission for the Coming Days (Dami Seonkyohwe). Far beyond a failed prophetic claim, the incident exposed deep theological vulnerabilities in the Korean Protestant landscape. Thousands of families were torn apart, careers and studies abandoned, and the authority of the church undermined. At the center of the movement stood Lee Jang-rim, a self-proclaimed prophet and former lay translator, whose teachings blended dispensational premillennialism, new revelations, and fear-based eschatology to mobilize a nationwide religious fervor.\n\nLee, who dropped out of Methodist Theological Seminary in his first year, had a background in Pentecostal and Holiness movements and spent over a decade working in Christian publishing. Through exposure to American eschatological texts—such as The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey, Raptured by Ernest Angley, and I Saw Heaven by Percy Collet—he formed a uniquely Korean version of rapture theology, which eventually coalesced into a specific date: October 28, 1992 . Lee claimed this date was confirmed through the visions of a high school student named “Jingun,” who allegedly received prophetic dreams.\n\nThe intensity of belief surrounding this date reached extreme proportions. Followers, estimated at around 20,000, sold their homes, quit jobs, severed family ties, and relocated to communes to prepare for the rapture. Some believers testified to seeing supernatural signs—pillars of fire and clouds—on the predicted date. Many claimed spiritual experiences and visions during collective worship sessions in the weeks leading up to October 28. These phenomena, which psychologists later interpreted as mass hallucination and group hypnosis, were cited by followers as divine confirmation.\n\nWhen October 28 passed uneventfully, the aftermath was catastrophic. Only about 5% of the followers returned to their previous churches, while up to 60% became disillusioned, suffered mental health breakdowns, or turned to atheism. Entire families had collapsed. Young adults abandoned studies and careers. Church communities, caught unprepared, responded poorly. Most churches failed to embrace those who returned, often viewing them as spiritually compromised. For many, the disappointment transitioned into a deep distrust of institutional religion.\n\nEven more concerning, a number of leaders involved in the 1992 prediction disappeared for a time and later resurfaced under new names, launching alternative cult movements with slightly modified doctrines. Experts at the time warned that once someone was fully absorbed by false revelations, recovery was unlikely, and relapse into new cultic ideologies was common.\n\nThe institutional church’s response was slow and fragmented. While some denominations—such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Tonghap and Hapdong branches)—issued formal heresy declarations against Lee Jang-rim by 1991, most pastors and congregations initially dismissed the movement as fringe. This allowed the message to spread relatively unchecked. After the failure of the prophecy, many in the church realized that they had neglected theological instruction and discernment training within their congregations.\n\nIn a detailed postmortem, Professor Park Yong-gyu outlined several key factors contributing to the disaster. First was the collapse of doctrinal education. Korean churches had drifted away from systematic theology, including instruction on salvation, revelation, and eschatology. Second, there was confusion between spiritual inspiration and revelation. Many believers misinterpreted dreams, emotions, or intuition as divine prophecy. Third, supernatural experience had displaced biblical authority. Visions, speaking in tongues, and ecstatic encounters were mistakenly elevated as normative faith experiences.\n\nPark also emphasized that Korean churches failed to teach that the date of Christ’s return is unknowable. While Lee’s followers cited verses like John 16:13 (“He will tell you what is yet to come”), they ignored Matthew 24:36, where Jesus clearly states that “no one knows the day or hour.” Misreading such passages allowed Lee to claim divine insight into the rapture date, despite scripture's explicit warning. Furthermore, there was almost no theological emphasis on the Trinity, or a robust doctrine of biblical sufficiency. Lee’s followers believed that salvation was attainable through “merit”—not by grace through faith—but by participating in communal rapture training and offering financial support .\n\nFinally, the rapture panic exposed the widespread emotionalism and mysticism in Korean Protestantism. Faith became increasingly grounded in ecstatic experience, not in Scripture. Dreams, visions, and private revelations were treated as trustworthy guides, often surpassing the Bible itself in authority. The 1992 incident showed that in the absence of careful theological instruction, even well-meaning Christians could be swept into heresy.\n\nIn retrospect, the Dami movement’s failure was not simply a false prophecy; it was a mirror reflecting the spiritual and theological immaturity of the Korean church. The legacy of 1992 continues in various forms today—whether through charismatic leaders claiming new revelations, “prophetic ministries” on YouTube, or fringe apocalyptic cults. The year 1992 was not the end of the world—but in many ways, it was judgment day for Korean Protestantism. ",
