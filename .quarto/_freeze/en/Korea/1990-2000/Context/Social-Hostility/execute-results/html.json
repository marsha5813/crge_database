For the first time since the ideological hostility of the Cold War, the decade witnessed a visible resurgence of anti-Christian sentiment—not from state repression, but from segments of civil society, university campuses, and the cultural sphere. This civic hostility was not unidirectional, however. Parallel to it were vibrant efforts to integrate Christianity into a rapidly diversifying and democratizing public sphere.\n\nHostility toward Christianity in the 1990s often stemmed from its perceived entanglement with political conservatism and institutional authority. With democratization accelerating after 1987, sectors of the younger generation—particularly in universities—began to view major Protestant denominations as morally compromised by their historical collusion with authoritarian regimes. On campuses such as Seoul National University and Korea University, anti-Christian sentiments were expressed in public debates, graffiti, and even symbolic protests against campus ministries. Christian student groups such as the Korean Christian Student Federation (KSCF) and university chapters of the Christian Council of Korea often found themselves navigating a hostile cultural climate, where faith-based identity was stigmatized as reactionary or anti-progressive.\n\nInter-religious tensions also contributed to civic hostility. As new religious movements (NRMs) such as JMS, Shincheonji, and the Unification Church gained media attention for scandals and controversial practices, the broader Christian community was often conflated with these fringe groups in public discourse. The 1992 apocalyptic prediction by Lee Jang-rim's Dami Mission, which falsely prophesied the rapture, led to public ridicule and widespread suspicion toward evangelical Christianity. The line between “orthodox” Christianity and cult-like sects was blurred in media coverage, fueling a wave of skepticism and mockery against Christian expressions broadly.\n\nIntra-Christian conflicts also intensified. The emergence of the New Apostolic Reformation and other charismatic movements sparked internal denunciations, with some mainline churches accusing such groups of heresy and causing disorder. Theologically, the divide between evangelical conservatism, progressive minjung theology, and liberal Protestantism deepened, producing hostile pamphleteering, protests, and institutional schisms. These conflicts, though internal, spilled into the public sphere, undermining the church's moral unity and further inviting civic criticism.\n\nHowever, this period was not defined solely by hostility. Significant efforts were made by Christian organizations and leaders to bridge divisions and re-establish a positive role for Christianity in civil society. The Christian Ethics Movement of Korea and the Catholic Justice and Peace Committee engaged in advocacy on behalf of laborers, the urban poor, and human rights victims, often working in collaboration with secular NGOs and interfaith networks. The YWCA and YMCA, though Christian in origin, emphasized gender justice, environmental stewardship, and civic education, helping rehabilitate the public image of Christianity as a socially responsible force.\n\nEfforts to integrate Christians into social institutions also took shape in the education sector and media. Christian-themed literature, theater, and film explored themes of redemption, social justice, and historical memory. Prominent Christians such as novelist Lee Mun-yeol, despite controversies, participated in public discourse on ethics and national identity. Moreover, the expansion of Christian colleges and universities such as Handong Global University represented attempts to harmonize faith and public service, forming leaders for a globalizing Korea.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1990s in South Korea were marked by a dual movement: on one hand, an intensification of civic hostility toward Christianity fueled by ideological, generational, and religious factors; on the other hand, sincere efforts by Christian individuals and institutions to re-engage society through service, reflection, and reform. This tension would shape the role of Christianity in the 21st century as both a contested and essential participant in Korean civil life. ",
