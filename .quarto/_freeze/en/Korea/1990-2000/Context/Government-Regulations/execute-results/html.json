Particularly under President Kim Young-sam, religious policies became increasingly biased toward Protestant Christianity, leading to a strong backlash from the Buddhist community and cautious responses from the Catholic Church.\n\nAs an elder of the Presbyterian Church, Kim regularly held family worship services in the presidential residence and even attended services at the National Army Central Church in his official capacity as president. These actions, widely reported in the media, signaled a fusion of public authority and private faith, raising serious concerns about the violation of state neutrality and the principle of separation between religion and state. In response, the Buddhist community vocally protested. The military chaplaincy system, limited to Protestants and Catholics, excluded other faiths such as Buddhism and Won Buddhism, fueling further accusations of institutional discrimination.\n\nThis imbalance was also evident in religious administrative practices. Government platforms such as the “AlGoga” public transit information system and educational geography databases omitted data on Buddhist temples, causing the Buddhist leadership to denounce such omissions as systemic discrimination rather than clerical error. Though the peak of public protest would erupt in 2008 under the Lee Myung-bak administration, the root of this tension can be traced back to the policy patterns of the 1990s.\n\nMeanwhile, Protestant churches strengthened their institutional ties with the state through events like the National Breakfast Prayer Meeting and the National Assembly Prayer Meeting. Throughout the 1990s, top political figures met regularly with Protestant leaders to discuss state affairs, which Protestant communities interpreted as prayer for national leadership, but which outside observers saw as collusion between church and state. One striking incident was the cancellation of the Buddhist-themed cultural park in Palgong Mountain in Daegu due to coordinated opposition by Protestant organizations, highlighting the unequal political clout among religious groups.\n\nThe Catholic Church took a more measured approach in the 1990s, drawing upon its legacy of democratic and human rights advocacy from the 1980s. Under the leadership of Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan, the Church refrained from direct political opposition, focusing instead on independent civic activism in areas such as social welfare, labor rights, and human dignity. Unlike Buddhism or Protestantism, which often asserted religious authority in public affairs, the Catholic Church emphasized trust and solidarity with civil society as its basis for influence.\n\n\nTable 1.

For decades, religious figures such as pastors, priests, and monks were effectively excluded from income taxation, with the state treating their honoraria, donations, and ministry allowances as non-taxable. This practice had been based on the premise of protecting religious autonomy, allowing religious institutions to operate with minimal interference. However, the 1990s saw increasing public criticism of this exceptional treatment.\n\nThe controversy was fueled by media reports revealing that some megachurches and well-known clergy were amassing substantial wealth through real estate investments, large-scale construction projects, and financial assets. In response, the National Tax Service (NTS) took a passive stance. In 1992, the NTS officially declared that \"taxation will be left to the discretion of religious figures,\" effectively announcing its intention not to impose income tax on clergy. This decision, grounded in custom rather than law, provoked backlash from civil society, which argued that tax exemption for a privileged group violated the constitutional principle that “all citizens shall have the duty to pay taxes.”\n\nProgressive religious circles, including the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) and the Catholic Justice and Peace Committee, acknowledged the legitimacy of taxation in principle. However, more conservative Protestant denominations and large churches vehemently opposed it. They insisted that taxation would violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and state and interpreted it as state control over faith. Some religious leaders even framed taxation as government persecution, organizing rallies, issuing public declarations, and threatening electoral retaliation.\n\nAt the same time, emerging movements within and outside the church began to assert that clergy taxation could serve as a corrective mechanism for financial corruption and undemocratic governance within religious institutions. New organizations like the “Church Financial Transparency Movement” called on religious groups to embrace taxation as a path to social credibility. Public dissatisfaction also grew, especially among nonreligious citizens, who criticized the special treatment of clergy as an emblem of structural inequality.\n\nThe political response was cautious. Given the electoral influence of religious groups, politicians were reluctant to push for reforms. One lawmaker in 1994 publicly stated that he had been threatened with a campaign of opposition from a major church for supporting clergy taxation. Thus, the taxation controversy was not merely a matter of fiscal administration but a deeply symbolic confrontation over the role of religion in the democratic public sphere. It involved intersecting questions of religious autonomy, political complicity, public trust, and the legitimacy of state authority.\n\nThough the issue remained unresolved throughout the 1990s, it did initiate a shift in public attitudes. Internal calls for self-regulation began to emerge in some churches. A few congregations started publicly disclosing financial audits and formalizing compensation standards. The clergy taxation debate marked the first serious challenge to the informal legal immunity that religious institutions had long enjoyed. This challenge ultimately laid the groundwork for policy changes in the 2010s, when the South Korean government began implementing a formal taxation system for clergy in 2018.\n\n\nEducation Related Policy\n\nIn the 1990s, South Korea’s public education system stood at a transitional moment as it sought to redefine its relationship with religious education—particularly Christian instruction. The Constitution and the Education Act of the Republic of Korea had long explicitly prohibited religious education in public schools. Article 5 of the Education Act, revised and enforced in 1995, reaffirmed this principle by stipulating that “no religious education shall be conducted in national or public schools for the benefit of any religion.” This provision reinforced religious neutrality as a constitutional value the state must uphold and institutionalized the principle of secularism within public education.\n\nDespite this foundational principle, the 1990s marked a period in which religious education began to be partially institutionalized in public schools. A notable example is the introduction of the subject “Religion” in the 6th National Curriculum, announced in 1992, for middle and high schools. Rather than focusing on the doctrines of a specific religion, this course was designed as part of a general liberal education that introduced various religious cultures. The Ministry of Education set the objective as providing “a broad understanding of the major world religions and traditional Korean religions.” As a result, the course was structured around a cultural approach that explored themes such as humanity, religion, and the meaning of life, rather than centering on churches or the Bible. This trend continued with the 7th National Curriculum announced in 1997. To guide the implementation of this subject, the Ministry of Education developed specific instructional guidelines under the theme: “How can religious values relate to modern life?” Consequently, religion textbooks were revised to encourage reflection on existential issues such as suffering, justice, life, and death, rather than promoting any particular religion.\n\nHowever, the institutionalization of religious education triggered significant controversy. Central to the debate was the conflict between religious (private) and public schools regarding the mode of religious education. Some Christian schools sought to maintain their existing worship and Bible-centered instruction, while Buddhist groups and general parents expressed concern about potential religious bias in public education. Educational scholars and civil organizations pointed out the “legal ambiguity surrounding the introduction of religion as a subject and the mixture of doctrinal and cultural content,” voicing their concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, different standards were applied to religious activities in private schools. In one case, South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that requiring chapel attendance as a graduation requirement at a private Christian university was not unconstitutional. In a 1998 decision, the court stated that such a requirement was “intended for the cultivation of well-rounded individuals and does not unduly infringe upon students’ freedom of religion.” This ruling established a legal precedent acknowledging the right of religious foundations to maintain a degree of religious identity in operating private schools.\n\nDuring this period, the Ministry of Education and local education offices repeatedly issued administrative directives affirming that “compulsory worship or prayer is not allowed in public schools.” In fact, some complaints were filed regarding the imposition of religious activities. The 1990s, therefore, represent a complex period during which religious education in public schools was negotiated between legal principles and practical realities. The defining feature of this era was the beginning of limited yet formalized inclusion of religion—including Christianity—into the structure of public education.\n\n\nTable 1. Institutional and Policy Shifts in Education\n\n| Decade | Public Education (Primary & Secondary) | Christian Private Universities |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950s | Public schools maintained constitutional and legal religious neutrality; religious education and worship were explicitly banned. | Yonsei University (1957) and Soongsil University (1954) reestablished with Christian mottos and chapel systems. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960s | No official religious subjects in the curriculum; worship or religious education remained prohibited in public schools. | Yonsei established its Office of the Chaplain (1962); Myongji University accredited as a Christian university (1967). |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970s | 1970 Ministry of Education directive banned religious education and worship during class hours. | Christian identity strengthened—Myongji (1972) officially adopted Christian values; Yonsei continued its chapel and Christian-based education. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980s | The Framework Act on Education codified the ban on specific religious instruction in public schools. | Luce Chapel completed (Yonsei, 1974); Soongsil emphasized Christian service; chapel and Christian curriculum institutionalized. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990s | The 1990 Framework Act on Education reaffirmed religious neutrality; religious subjects remained excluded from the curriculum. | Christian identity maintained under increasing state regulation; Yonsei's bylaws allowed denominational board appointments. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1990s, the relationship between Christianity and public education in South Korea evolved through a series of legal, institutional, and cultural shifts. While the state upheld religious neutrality in public education throughout these decades, Christian-affiliated private institutions—especially universities such as Yonsei, Soongsil, and Myongji—maintained their religious identity and mission through varying policies and legal frameworks.\n\nIn the 1950s, shortly after the Korean War, the state reestablished public education based on constitutional principles, one of which was the separation of religion and education in state-funded schools. The Education Act, reflecting these values, prohibited religious education and worship within public schools. However, Christian universities, which had often been established by foreign missionaries during the colonial or pre-war era, reemerged with a clear commitment to their founding values. Yonsei University, formed in 1957 through the merger of Severance Union Medical College and Chosun Christian University, adopted the motto “The truth will set you free,” affirming its evangelical mission. Soongsil University reopened in 1954, also grounded in a vision of Christian service and national reconstruction. Weekly chapel services and Christian leadership education were institutionalized as part of their curricula.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Korean state maintained its strict position on religious neutrality in public schools, and no formal religious subject was included in the national curriculum. Nevertheless, Christian universities expanded their structures for spiritual formation. Yonsei formally established its Office of the Chaplain in 1962, solidifying its chapel system and campus ministry. Myongji University, founded by the Christian Holiness Church, received accreditation as a four-year university in 1967. These universities continued to emphasize Christian values in their governance, educational objectives, and student life.\n\nThe 1970s saw a more explicit enforcement of religious neutrality in public schools. In 1970, the Ministry of Education issued a formal directive banning worship services and religious instruction during school hours. This reflected growing concerns about fairness and pluralism within an increasingly diverse society. However, Christian private universities moved in the opposite direction, reaffirming their religious identity in response to rapid modernization. For instance, Myongji University merged with Kwandong University in 1972 and officially defined “Christian character formation” as part of its educational mission. Yonsei, too, preserved its Christian heritage through symbols, governance structures, and worship life, including the continued use of chapel services and Christian-based general education.\n\nIn the 1980s, these trends became more institutionalized. With the enactment of the Framework Act on Education in the late 1980s, the legal ban on religious instruction in public schools was codified. This reinforced the separation of religion from state-run education. Nonetheless, Christian universities deepened their religious formation programs. Yonsei University completed the Luce Chapel in 1974 and maintained regular worship, while Soongsil emphasized its founding motto, “Truth and Service,” as a guiding philosophy in both liberal arts and leadership education.\n\nBy the 1990s, the public education system had fully embraced the principle of religious neutrality. The Framework Act on Education, implemented in 1990, formally stated that no public educational institution should engage in religious instruction or religious discrimination. However, Christian universities continued to develop under a dual framework: they maintained their founding mission, while also complying with increasing governmental regulation on accreditation, faculty hiring, and curriculum standards. For example, the bylaws of Yonsei University included provisions for denominational church representatives to serve as members of the board of trustees, reflecting both legal recognition of their identity and negotiation with state policies.\n\nOverall, this five-decade trajectory shows a consistent divide between public education and religious neutrality on the one hand, and the sustained religious identity of Christian private institutions on the other. Christian-affiliated universities were not merely religious in origin but continuously reasserted their mission through institutional governance, worship practices, and character formation education—marking them as unique actors in South Korea’s evolving educational landscape.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nNorth Korea’s religious policy in the 1990s appeared on the surface to be gradually liberalizing through renewed international exchanges and the existence of official churches, yet in reality, it was deeply embedded in Juche ideology and a system of authoritarian control. Following the establishment of Bongsu Church and Jangchung Cathedral in the late 1980s, the regime continued throughout the 1990s to showcase these religious institutions as evidence of “religious freedom.” In truth, these churches were tightly controlled by the Ministry of State Security and served more as instruments of propaganda than spaces for authentic worship.\n\nUnder Kim Jong-il, the regime departed from Kim Il-sung’s ambiguous tolerance of religious-humanist parallels, instead transforming Juche into a leadership-centered orthodoxy that intensified the suppression of religion. Religious adherents were labeled as “impure elements” and classified into the lower class under the songbun system, barring them from education, employment, and Party membership. Underground church activities often led to execution or incarceration in political prison camps.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1990s, as many North Koreans returned from China after experiencing Christianity during the “Arduous March” famine, small-scale underground churches formed within family circles. These, too, were subject to harsh crackdowns, surveillance, torture, and arrests. Meanwhile, the regime used the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) to expand contact with South Korean Protestant groups and international organizations like the World Council of Churches (WCC). These efforts, however, were guided not by a genuine interest in interfaith dialogue but by propaganda and the strategic objectives of the United Front. In sum, North Korea’s religious policy in the 1990s was not designed to accommodate or recognize religion internally, but rather to maximize its diplomatic utility and ideological control.\n\n\nUnification Policies\n\nDuring the 1990s, the unification policies of North and South Korea evolved in response to the collapse of the Cold War order and shifting global dynamics. South Korea, under President Roh Tae-woo, initiated a “Nordpolitik” (Northern Policy) that culminated in the 1991 Basic Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, and Exchange. This agreement pursued gradual unification based on mutual cooperation and peaceful coexistence. President Kim Young-sam later reinforced this approach but emphasized unification under a liberal democratic system. In contrast, North Korea—undergoing leadership transition after Kim Il-sung’s death—promoted the principle of national self-determination and proposed a “low-level federation” model grounded in autonomy, peace, and national solidarity.\n\nAmid these developments, religion—particularly Korean Christianity—emerged not merely as a passive observer but as an active agent of engagement and dialogue. The National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued its landmark 1988 “Declaration on the Peace and Reunification of the Korean People,” formally recognizing the principles of the 7.4 Joint Statement and the 1991 Basic Agreement. Throughout the 1990s, the NCCK facilitated inter-Korean religious exchanges, organized prayer meetings, and visited Pyongyang, positioning the church as a moral voice in the national unification discourse.\n\nNorth Korea, for its part, utilized religion—specifically through the Korean Christian Federation (KCF)—as a strategic tool for diplomacy. The regime sought to enhance its international image by permitting limited religious contact with the South, including co-authored inter-Korean prayer texts and official worship services at Bongsu Church. However, this form of engagement was carefully curated and served more as a propaganda device than a genuine expression of religious freedom.\n\nThus, unification policy in the 1990s advanced in parallel along ideological lines, yet allowed limited symbolic and cultural interactions. Religion served not merely as a tool of propaganda or compliance, but as a medium for inter-Korean cooperation and as a moral and symbolic resource in the quest for national unity.\n\n\nComprehensive Analysis of the Growth and Decline of Korean Protestantism and Catholicism\n\n\nThe 1990s was a pivotal decade in the religious history of South Korea. This period witnessed both the peak and the beginning of a transition for Korean Christianity—Protestantism and Catholicism alike. The sociopolitical landscape was rapidly evolving with the consolidation of democracy, the spread of neoliberal reforms, the rise of consumer individualism, and the dramatic economic collapse following the 1997 IMF crisis. In this context, religious institutions served not only spiritual functions but also became key actors in education, welfare, social ethics, and identity formation. This report presents a comprehensive synthesis of multiple academic studies that examined the multifaceted growth and subsequent stagnation or decline of these two major religious traditions in Korea throughout the 1990s.\n\n\nGrowth Factors and Processes: Protestantism\n\nProtestant megachurches rapidly expanded in the 1990s, particularly in urbanized and affluent areas like Gangnam. This growth was driven by the strategic acquisition of land during the 1980s, coupled with increasing inflow of middle-class families seeking education, stability, and community. Churches implemented diversified ministry models including cell ministry, charismatic worship, youth-oriented outreach, and multimedia services. Churches like A, B, and C (as case studies show) achieved exponential increases in membership and annual budgets, developing complex church campuses with sanctuaries, education halls, and welfare centers. Additionally, worship spaces transformed architecturally: sanctuaries shifted from linear layouts to fan-shaped and sloped auditoriums to ensure visual engagement and participation. This physical expansion supported the theological emphasis on community, evangelism, and active lay participation.\n\n\nGrowth Factors and Processes: Catholicism\n\nCatholicism grew significantly in public trust and influence, partly due to its role in pro-democracy movements in the 1980s and its consistent advocacy for human rights. Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan emerged as a moral authority. Catholic organizations invested heavily in pastoral work for the marginalized—laborers, farmers, the urban poor, and youth. During the IMF crisis, the Catholic Church took symbolic and material leadership in national recovery efforts, most famously through the gold donation campaign. In terms of facilities, churches expanded welfare programs, educational missions, and lay formation. The Church emphasized values of solidarity, social responsibility, and ecological ethics, which resonated with parts of the population disillusioned by materialism and political instability.\n\n\nTable 2. Growth Factors and Backgrounds\n\n| Category | Protestantism | Catholicism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Social Structure | Urbanization, Gangnam development, rise of middle class | Post-democratization image of justice, increased public trust |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Religious Strategy | Evangelical revivalism, diversified worship, cell ministry | Social justice, peace, labor pastoral mission, rural and youth outreach |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Spatial Factors | Megachurches with multifunctional spaces (education, culture, counseling) | Expanded educational and welfare functions of parishes and monasteries |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Theological Trends | Growth-oriented, gospel-centered, civic engagement | Liberation theology, Minjung theology, contextual practice |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Social Demand | Spiritual stability and community in an unstable society | Emphasis on solidarity and sacrifice, gold donation campaign during IMF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nDecline Factors and Structural Challenges: Protestantism\n\nFrom the mid-1990s, criticism toward Protestantism grew due to internal scandals, increasing alignment between church leaders and political power, and the inheritance of church leadership by family members. Some megachurches were seen as overly commercialized, eroding their moral authority. Generational divides deepened as younger Koreans left the church in search of more inclusive, less hierarchical spaces or distanced themselves from organized religion altogether. The consumer orientation of ministry—emphasizing comfort, success, and self-improvement—raised questions about theological depth and institutional priorities. Moreover, aggressive competition among denominations and a decline in campus ministry further signaled weakening influence among youth.\n\n\nDecline Factors and Structural Challenges: Catholicism\n\nWhile Catholicism maintained relatively high public trust, it too faced stagnation. Its highly centralized clerical structure limited lay leadership and innovation. Youth engagement slowed, and many viewed Catholic worship and doctrines as less accessible or relevant. Despite active social justice efforts, the institutional inertia and traditional hierarchy hindered long-term growth and adaptability. By the late 1990s, both traditions had reached an inflection point—popular in public life, yet increasingly distant from emerging generations and shifting cultural values.\n\nTable 3. Decline Factors and Structural Variables\n\n| Category | Protestantism | Catholicism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Political Alignment | Some pastors' political alignment and public statements → decline in trust | Generally refrained from political speech but aligned with social justice |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Perception | Commercialization, lack of financial transparency | Perceived as conservative and institutional by outsiders |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Generational Gap | Youth disengagement, weakened college ministry | Active youth pastoral efforts but aging population and secularization |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Internal Structure | Inheritance controversies, denominational competition | Clericalism, limited lay participation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nSocial Responses and Religious Perception\n\nSouth Korean society in the 1990s responded to religion with both appreciation and skepticism. Religious institutions were valued for their contributions to welfare, community support, and national recovery—especially during the 1997–98 financial crisis. However, increasing reports of internal corruption, lack of transparency, and political entanglement prompted critical public discourse. Religious spaces became multifunctional hubs—serving educational, counseling, and cultural roles. Many churches opened facilities to local communities, which helped bridge social fragmentation in rapidly urbanized districts. Catholicism’s association with civil society activism further strengthened its credibility. Nonetheless, the rise of individualism and secularization—especially among the youth—meant that institutional religion faced a long-term decline in authority. Both Protestant and Catholic churches struggled to adapt to a landscape where spiritual affiliation was increasingly seen as personal, voluntary, and pluralistic rather than institutional and collective.\n\n ",
