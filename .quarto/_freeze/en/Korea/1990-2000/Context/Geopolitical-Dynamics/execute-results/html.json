South Korean civil society responded with protests whenever the Japanese government approved controversial history textbooks. For instance, in the early 1990s and again in 2001, large-scale demonstrations erupted in Seoul against newly authorized Japanese history textbooks that were accused of minimizing or distorting atrocities committed during World War II. Public outrage centered particularly on Japan’s treatment of issues like “comfort women” and forced labor, demanding not only apologies but concrete reparative actions. In 1995, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued an official statement of apology regarding colonial rule and wartime aggression. However, many Koreans viewed the apology as insufficient due to the lack of follow-through or policy change.\n\nIn contrast, South Korea’s normalization of diplomatic relations with China in August 1992 marked a historic turning point. South Korea was the last major East Asian country to formalize ties with Beijing, and the move fundamentally shifted regional geopolitics. The two countries launched broad economic cooperation, with bilateral trade expanding from $6.4 billion in 1992 to over $145 billion by 2007. This rapid economic interdependence encouraged China to view its relationship with South Korea as more important than its historical alliance with North Korea. The shift also reflected a broader strategic transition in South Korean foreign policy from Cold War ideology to pragmatic economic diplomacy. The normalization of relations had religious and cultural implications as well. With increased Korean migration and business activity in China, Korean Christian missionaries and churches expanded their presence in major Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai. The South Korean government supported cultural diplomacy and overseas missions as part of its soft power strategy. Although religious activity in China remained restricted, Korean Christian networks played a growing role in cultural and spiritual exchanges between the two countries.\n\n\nRelations with the U.S. \n\n\nSince the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty, the United States has been South Korea’s principal military and diplomatic ally. During the 1990s, the alliance remained robust despite limited troop reductions and discussions about base relocation. U.S. forces continued to play a key role in the defense of the Korean Peninsula. The Clinton administration and South Korean government launched the Land Partnership Plan (LPP) to rationalize the footprint of U.S. military installations in Korea. Despite these changes, the majority of South Koreans continued to view the alliance as central to national security.\n\nAmerican missionaries, who had first arrived in the late 19th century, had already left a profound legacy in Korea through the establishment of hospitals, schools, and churches. Institutions such as Yonsei University and Ewha Womans University originated from missionary initiatives that integrated Christian ethics with modern education and healthcare. In the 1990s, as South Korean Protestantism reached its peak, Korea emerged as one of the world’s leading missionary-sending countries, second only to the United States. Korean missionaries were dispatched globally, including to China, Central Asia, and Africa, further reinforcing the transnational Christian network.\n\nThe influence of Christian values shaped both civic life and foreign policy discourse. Many conservative Protestant groups supported pro-American and anti-communist positions, viewing the U.S. not only as a military ally but also as a spiritual and moral partner. The perception of shared values between Korean Protestantism and American evangelicalism helped sustain strong diplomatic sentiment toward the U.S. during this decade.\n\n\nNationalism and Patriotic Sentiments\n\n\nNationalist sentiment surged in 1990s South Korea, especially through public discourse on unresolved historical injustices and territorial issues with Japan and China. Both the government and mass media actively promoted narratives of Korean ethnic unity and historical suffering. History textbooks and televised documentaries increasingly focused on the Japanese colonial period, independence movements, and comfort women, fostering collective memory and patriotic education. Symbolic national holidays such as Independence Movement Day (March 1) and Liberation Day (August 15) became focal points for public commemoration and national pride.\n\nOne of the most significant civic innovations of the late 1990s was the emergence of candlelight vigils as a peaceful form of mass protest. The earliest candlelight demonstrations began in 1992 in response to rising internet fees, but the most notable early example occurred in 2002, after a U.S. military vehicle killed two Korean schoolgirls in the Yangju incident. Thousands of South Koreans gathered peacefully in Gwanghwamun Square, holding candles to mourn the victims and demand justice. Although the protests were triggered by anger toward U.S. military impunity, they symbolized a larger desire for dignity, national autonomy, and democratic expression.\n\nCandlelight vigils soon became a hallmark of Korean civic identity. They were widely adopted in subsequent protests, such as the 2004 impeachment protests, the 2008 Mad Cow Disease demonstrations, and most prominently, the 2016–2017 candlelight revolution that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Thus, the late 1990s witnessed not only the intensification of patriotic sentiment, but also the birth of a new, nonviolent form of collective identity grounded in democratic participation. ",
