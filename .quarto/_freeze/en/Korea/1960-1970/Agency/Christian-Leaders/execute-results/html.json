His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers’ School, which became more than a school — it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.\n\nKim's background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim’s lifelong compass: “The intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.” This wasn’t simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.\n\nKim’s household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one’s responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the \"Canaan community\" — a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.\n\nFrom this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers’ School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: diligence, service, and sacrifice. Labor, in Kim’s view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. \"Those who do not work shall not eat,\" he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.\n\nIn 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school’s influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea’s Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim’s core values — self-help, self-reliance, cooperation — were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school’s training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.\n\nFurthermore, Kim’s insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement’s community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki’s Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim's influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.\n\nUltimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki’s 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers’ School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‘city on a hill’ where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer’s hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.\n\n\n한경직 韓景職 Kyung-Chik Han\n\n12/29/1902 ~ 04/19/2000\n\n\nThe 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev. Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation’s humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.\n\n\nNationwide Evangelization Movement: \"Thirty Million to Christ\"\n\nIn 1965, Rev. Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of \"Evangelism in Depth\". Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.\n\nThe campaign’s slogan, “Thirty Million to Christ”, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han's radical vision to reshape Korea’s societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev. Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.\n\n\nGospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction\n\nHan’s vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, “Become a New Person, Build a New Nation”. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea’s rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley’s role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.\n\nHe envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.\n\n\nTable 1. 1960s Evangelism & North Korea-Related Ministry of Han Kyung-Jik\n\n| Year | Event | Summary |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1962 | Presbyterian Jubilee Sermon | Han declares the vision of national evangelism: “The gospel must reach all 30 million people.” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1964 | Evangelization roundtable | Han introduces the “Evangelism in Depth” strategy at a church leaders' meeting with Kim Hwal-lan. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1965 | Nationwide Evangelization Movement | Begins Korea’s first large-scale, interdenominational gospel campaign: “Thirty Million to Christ.” Emphasizes culture-wide evangelism using media. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1966 | Berlin World Evangelism Conference | Learns the “Golden Harvest” model, leading to focus on evangelism in the military and industrial sectors. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1967–1969 | Support for North Korea | Suggests humanitarian aid campaigns and frames them as gospel responsibilities. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970 | “Spiritual Revolution” Evangelistic Rally | Calls for national repentance, ethical reform, and spiritual rebirth under the slogan: “A New Person, A New Nation.” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nNorth Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel\n\nAnother defining element of Rev. Han’s ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han’s approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action — advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.\n\n\n김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim\n\n09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987\n\n\nThe 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev. Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community’s progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.\n\nIn 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government’s normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan’s colonial rule, was in his eyes “an insult to history and a dishonest act before God.” He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, “Normalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.” Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the “National Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,” which resisted President Park’s unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, “Those who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people’s sovereignty but also God’s justice.” His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church’s sole mission is “saving souls,” which he called “a retreat from reality.” He stressed that “the church must declare God’s will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.” This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.\n\n\n장준하  張俊河 Chun-ha Chang\n\n08/27/1918 ~ 08/17/1975\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a “Christian martyr spirit.” During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called “Pastor Jang” by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.\n\nThese values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine Sasanggye (사상계), which Jang founded and edited. Sasanggye was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang’s spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, “We are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck... At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.” This statement reflects the gravity of Sasanggye’s role as more than a publication—it was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime’s oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, “Political freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.” Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.\n\nAt the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that “if the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.” He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.\n\nFor Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as Sasanggye was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a \"mouthpiece of the people,\" demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.\n\n\n함석헌 咸錫憲 Seok-heon Ham\n\n03/13/1901 ~ 02/04/1989\n\n\nThe 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of \"the people\" and \"Ssi’al\" at the center of his intellectual resistance.\n\nFor Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, “The people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham's theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.” This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham’s distinctive philosophy of Ssi’al. He stated, “He found Ssi’al-ness in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‘resistance’ was simultaneously the individual’s process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.” The Ssi’al are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth—seeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee’s administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, “Rather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.” This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ham's spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (mugyohoe) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, “For me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.” He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a “militant pacifist.” His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. “Although he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.” While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for “liberal democracy through the political subjectification of the Ssi’al.” Thus, Ham’s work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship—it was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the Ssi’al philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.\n\n\nGeorge Ogle\n\n01/27/1929 ~ 11/17/2020\n\n\nRev. George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers' rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that “the gospel cannot remain confined within church walls—it must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.”\n\nBeginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon’s poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job—gestures that gradually earned their trust. Influenced by the French \"Worker-Priest\" movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a “working clergy” program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers’ experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, “Don’t go there thinking you’re going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.”\n\nOgle’s mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers’ organization and political awareness, insisting that “democracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.” The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women’s labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle’s activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called “People’s Revolutionary Party Incident,” he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: “Rev. Ogle, farewell… Most of us know that you worked for our country’s true freedom and democracy… Your name will remain in history.”\n\nRev. George Ogle’s work was more than religious ministry—it was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.\n\n\n장기려 張起呂Gi-ryeo Jang\n\n10/05/1911 ~ 12/25/1995\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, Dr. Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea's medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: “to serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.” This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that “he would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor”—a vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.\n\nEntering the 1960s, Dr. Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the “Busan Meeting,” which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr. Jang recalled, “I had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.” This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.\n\nThe Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968—well before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name “Blue Cross” was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American “Blue Cross” system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well. The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr. Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that “love for one’s neighbor” could be understood as a form of “cooperative spirit.” This was not merely metaphorical—Christian theology shaped the Union’s policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.\n\nThe Blue Cross was also Korea’s first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea’s eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr. Jang’s work transcended hospital management—it became a model of faith-driven social reform.\n\nHis life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards—including the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize—he often humbly said, “I am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.” Dr. Jang’s activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a “good doctor,” but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.\n\n\n서병호 徐丙浩 Byeong-ho Seo\n\n07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972Seo Byung-ho (徐丙浩, 1885–1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School—founded by his father—and Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.\n\nDuring his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.\n\nThe Korean Red Cross, under Seo's leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.\n\nSeo once stated, \"Christ is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,\" emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization—under his guidance—emerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.\n\nAfter Korea’s liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.\n\nIn the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea’s political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement.\n\nSeo’s activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea’s modern history.\n\n\n박형규 朴炯圭Hyung-kyu Park\n\n08/25/1923 ~ 08/18/2018\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, Rev. Hyung-kyu Park’s activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.\n\nThe April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: “When I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.” He goes on to state, “I vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.”\n\nFollowing this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, “To achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.” From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of \"church democratization\" and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.\n\nThe anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity’s engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled “Our View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,” with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.\n\nIn 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee’s attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the “National Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,” he sharply criticized the regime in Christian Thought magazine, writing, “The Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.” He proclaimed, “The forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.” From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled “The Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,” he asserted that “the presence of Christians” meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless. In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan “Go to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,” the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of Christian Thought magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine’s focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.⁶\n\nIn the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul's shantytowns, supported by Park’s team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, “National modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.\n\nIn summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action—a church truly becoming the church in the world.\n\n\n조용기 趙鏞基David Yonggi Cho \n\n02/14/1936 ~ 09/14/2021\n\n\nThe ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea’s post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called “hope in the midst of despair.”\n\nCho’s ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God's urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, “The movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church’s journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.”\n\nDespite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea’s mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation. Yet Cho’s message had already gained widespread popularity. “He understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,” Park notes. Cho’s sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to “enjoy God’s blessings in the here and now,” giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences. His “Threefold Blessing” message—salvation, physical healing, and material prosperity—spoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.\n\nUnlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology. This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that “differences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.” Cho’s theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations—Presbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist—gathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as “a space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.”\n\nIt is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. “If Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,” Cho once wrote. Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a “gendered division of spiritual labor” in early Korean Pentecostalism.\n\nIn conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho’s ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be “evangelical” in Korea’s modern religious landscape.\n\n\n장면 張勉 John M. Chang\n\n\nJang Myeon (John Chang, 1899–1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang’s life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, “He was a ‘Catholic politician’ who sought to act according to Christian principles” even after entering political life.\n\nBefore his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College. Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was The Faith of Our Fathers, which he chose, as he put it, because “it became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.”\n\nThis background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea’s liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government’s advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that “the foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.” Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea’s first constitution and introduced a provision on “the sanctity and protection of marriage” to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women's rights. He later reflected, “This clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.”\n\nThe 1950s marked Jang’s rise on the international stage. As Korea’s first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, “After working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.”\n\nThis trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea’s newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as “an extension of faith and a service to the people,” spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy. However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a “former politician,” he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, “Politics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.”\n\nJang’s role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.\n\n\n ",
