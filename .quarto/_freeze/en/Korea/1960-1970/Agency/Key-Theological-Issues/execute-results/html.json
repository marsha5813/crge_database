Rooted in the 1906 Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, the Pentecostal emphasis on Spirit baptism and glossolalia (speaking in tongues) entered Korea through American missionary Mary Rumsey in 1928, followed by the establishment of the first Pentecostal church in Seobinggo in 1932. The movement was formally institutionalized with the founding of the Korean Assemblies of God in 1953. A transformative figure in this process was Pastor Yonggi Cho, who, along with Choi Ja-sil, began his ministry in a tent church in 1958. His ministry flourished during the 1960s, culminating in the establishment of Yoido Full Gospel Church, which would later become the world’s largest congregation. As Bae notes, “through glossolalia, divine healing, and exorcism, the Pentecostal leaders delivered messages of hope and healing to a suffering Korean public.”\n\nPastor Cho developed a contextualized theology centered on the “Threefold Blessing” (salvation, prosperity, health) and the “Fivefold Gospel” (salvation, Spirit baptism, healing, blessing, and the Second Coming). This theology emphasized Spirit baptism “not as an internal emotional experience, but as an empowering force for life transformation,” thus distinguishing it from more doctrinal or institutional forms of Protestantism. The spiritual emphasis of the movement found widespread resonance in postwar Korean society, which was recovering from national trauma and grappling with rapid industrialization. As Ryu observes, “Pentecostalism became a channel of healing and recovery for those suffering from physical illness and spiritual exhaustion.” People who were marginalized economically and socially found solace in divine healing, communal prayer, and supernatural experiences like visions and prophecy.\n\nBy the 1970s, Korean Pentecostalism had extended its influence beyond national borders. Pastor Cho gained international attention through publications like Charisma magazine and was identified as one of the most influential charismatic leaders worldwide. According to GOODTV News, “Cho’s work helped ignite the charismatic movement in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.” This global expansion was symbolized by the 1984 International Prayer Conference for World Evangelization, hosted in Seoul. According to Lee, “the spirituality of Korean Pentecostalism—centered on communal prayer and miraculous faith—catalyzed a global youth prayer movement and offered a communal alternative to the individualism of Western Christianity.” Despite its remarkable growth, the movement faced criticism for being overly privatized and materially oriented. “It shifted from an eschatologically grounded, socially engaged revival to an ahistorical movement focused narrowly on individual salvation and prosperity,” observes Ryu Nevertheless, Bae concludes that “the Pentecostal Movement provided a direct spiritual encounter with God through prayer and healing, offering comfort to the masses in times of hardship.”\n\n\nIndigenization Debate in the Korean Church \n\n\nThe indigenization debate in 1960s Korea was not merely a matter of theological semantics, but a critical rethinking of the relationship between the universality of the gospel and the particularity of cultural contexts. This discourse developed in parallel with global theological movements such as the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and the World Council of Churches' emphasis on inculturation. At its core, the debate centered on whether the gospel could be rooted in local cultures, and how Christian theology might engage with indigenous religious and philosophical traditions. It reflected a post-colonial desire among Korean theologians to move beyond transplanted Western missionary theology and toward a theologically autonomous expression grounded in Korean religious sentiments.Yoo Dong-sik: Interpreting the Gospel Through the Lens of Dao\n\nIn his early works “Dao and Logos” (1959) and “The Task of Indigenizing the Gospel in Korea” (1962), Yoo Dong-sik proposed that the Korean mind is more aligned with the Eastern concept of ‘Dao’ than with the Western notion of ‘Logos.’ He argued, “Attempting to interpret the gospel solely through Western concepts obscures its essence,” emphasizing the need to express the gospel in culturally resonant terms.Jun Kyung-yeon: The Gospel as Transcultural Revelation\n\nIn his 1963 essay “Can Christian Culture Be Indigenized?”, Jun countered Yoo’s proposal by arguing that “The gospel is not something that simply takes root in a culture; it is a transcendent revelation.” He criticized Yoo’s approach for compromising “the uniqueness and transcendence of the gospel.”Yoon Sung-beom: Seeking Trinitarian Hints in Dangun Mythology\n\nYoon interpreted Korea’s Dangun mythology as a “Vestigium Trinitatis”—a foreshadowing of the Trinity. He wrote, “The triadic structure of Hwanin, Hwanung, and Hwangeom aligns with the Christian understanding of the Creator, Redeemer, and Perfecter.”Park Bong-rang and Lee Sang-young: Critical Response\n\nPark and Lee strongly opposed Yoon’s interpretation, criticizing it as a form of religious syncretism. Lee in particular asserted, “Dangun mythology is not a precursor to Christian revelation but mere myth; it contains no redemptive truth.”\n\nWhile the debate in theological circles was vibrant, the institutional church showed limited enthusiasm for actual structural reforms. Worship formats, church architecture, and musical styles remained heavily Westernized. Lee Sang-gyu noted, “Korean churches affirmed indigenization in theory but rarely implemented it in worship, education, or liturgical form.” Many Korean Protestants equated Christian faith with ‘Christian culture,’ which they in turn equated with Western civilization. As Lee observed, this tendency “led the church to confuse the gospel with imported Christian customs.” Church buildings adopted Romanesque and Gothic styles, with pulpits and chancels modeled after Western designs. Lee pointed out, “Such structures were more reflective of inculturation than true indigenization.”\n\nDespite institutional hesitance, the indigenization debate marked a turning point. It compelled Korean theologians to reimagine Christianity in cultural terms and laid the foundation for later theological movements such as Minjung theology, liberation theology, and ecological theology. While the church as a whole remained structurally unchanged, this period sparked Korea’s transition from imported to creative theology.\n\n\nTable 9.
