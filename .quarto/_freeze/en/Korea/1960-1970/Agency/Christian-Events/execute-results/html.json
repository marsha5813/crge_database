Though technically democratic under the First and Second Republics, the country fell into political chaos until a 1961 military coup led by General Park Chung Hee ushered in a new era of authoritarian developmentalism. Park’s regime emphasized political stability, national identity formation, and centralized planning to achieve rapid economic growth. The government mobilized civil society under slogans like “anti-communism,” “national discipline,” and “spiritual reconstruction,” shaping a social climate where moral education and civic virtue became national priorities. This aligned closely with the goals of many Protestant institutions, including the Bible Clubs, which offered programs designed to promote self-discipline, patriotism, and moral integrity through a Christian lens. These clubs fit into a broader national strategy that sought to remake Korean citizens not only as economic actors but also as ideologically reliable subjects within a Cold War framework.\n\nDespite economic growth, South Korea in the 1960s was still predominantly agrarian. Rural communities were left behind in terms of infrastructure, education, and job opportunities. This inequality led to massive internal migration, as young people left the countryside for urban industrial centers. In response, the government launched campaigns like the Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement) in the early 1970s, but its roots were already forming in the 1960s through the National Reconstruction Movement, which sought to re-educate the countryside with the values of diligence, cooperation, and modernization. Bible Clubs in rural areas acted as early precursors to these efforts, operating as “reconstruction schools” where rural youth were taught literacy, Christian ethics, basic hygiene, and work discipline. Many youth who were excluded from formal schooling because of cost or lack of facilities found alternative forms of education and community through these clubs.\n\nThe 1960s also exposed the limits of Korea’s public education system. While elementary school attendance became nearly universal thanks to compulsory education laws, secondary schooling remained inaccessible to a large portion of the population, especially in rural and working-class urban areas. In 1960, the middle school enrollment rate was only 26.9%; by 1970 it had risen to just 40.8%. The highly competitive nature of secondary education meant that many students were either unable to enroll or dropped out early. This gap created space for non-formal educational models like the Bible Clubs. As one scholar notes, “Bible Clubs filled the vacuum left by an overstretched public education system, offering structured civic and moral training for youth in communities otherwise left behind by development.” These clubs functioned not only as church schools but also as informal civic academies that supported both academic literacy and ethical instruction.\n\nThe global Cold War and U.S. support for South Korea also shaped the ideological landscape of the 1960s. American missionaries had long played a role in Korean education, and in the postwar period, U.S.-based Protestant organizations provided funding, personnel, and curriculum support to evangelical and educational efforts across the peninsula. Christianity, especially Protestantism, was viewed favorably by the South Korean state as a moral counterforce to communism.\n\nThe Bible Club Movement operated within this Cold War matrix, emphasizing biblical literacy, anti-communist ethics, and civic engagement. Clubs often worked in tandem with local churches and foreign mission boards to produce instructional materials, train teachers, and develop faith-based approaches to civic responsibility. As such, Bible Clubs served not only as alternative schools but also as sites of ideological formation in South Korea’s larger national strategy of moral reconstruction.\n\n\nTable 2.

Amidst the aftermath of the Korean War, rapid industrialization, and the rise of a military regime, Christian education sought to redefine its identity and establish a firm foundation within a drastically changing society. This era marked a transitional phase where Christian education moved beyond mere doctrinal instruction and began to develop into a recognized academic discipline that responded to social change.\n\nSunday schools became a central site for Christian education in this context. Having been weakened during the years of war and division, they regained vitality in the 1960s alongside the rapid expansion of church membership. By 1969, the total number of Christians in Korea was estimated to be around 3.19 million. Participation was so high that Sunday school attendance in many churches rivaled the number of adult congregants. Known as \"bean sprout classrooms\" due to the overcrowded conditions, Sunday schools served not only as sites for religious instruction but also as hubs for community outreach and evangelism.\n\nThis widespread expansion is evident in statistical records. For example, in Daejeon in 1961, 8 out of 10 kindergartens were operated by Protestant institutions, and 246 out of 348 children (71%) were enrolled in Christian kindergartens. In secondary education, Protestant schools enrolled 818 out of 11,834 total middle school students (6.9% overall, 18.4% among private school students). At the high school level, 452 students attended Christian schools such as Daesung High School (122) and Hosudon Girls' High School (330), comprising 5.4% of all students and 17.2% of those in private schools. In higher education, four out of five institutions in Daejeon were Christian-affiliated, with 394 out of 2,642 students (15%) enrolled in these schools. These figures reflect the significant role Christian education played in private education during the time.\n\nIn 1960, Soongsil University established the first department of Christian education in Korea, and the following year saw the founding of the Korean Society of Christian Education. These developments institutionalized the academic study of Christian education and contributed to the formulation of denominational educational policies, the development of curricula, and the theoretical foundations of church education. The introduction of the roles of educational evangelists and education-oriented pastoral ministries also took shape during this period. \n\nDespite these institutional advancements, the internal quality of Christian education often lagged behind the church's rapid quantitative growth. Instruction remained predominantly didactic and focused on children and youth, with little attention to adult or social education. Concepts such as social justice, democracy, and human rights were rarely addressed. Kim Kwan-suk, in a 1967 issue of Christian Education, criticized the apathy of educators, referring to issues such as \"urbanization and sex,\" \"mass society indifference,\" and \"loss of identity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, government education reforms under President Park Chung-hee posed structural challenges to Christian schools. Policies such as the middle school entrance lottery (1969) and high school equalization (1973) curtailed the schools' autonomy and religious identity. The Ministry of Education attempted to limit religious instruction, and backlash from students and parents further complicated the schools' operations.\n\nNevertheless, the 1960s served as a critical foundation for the academic and institutional development of Christian education in Korea. The establishment of the Korean Society of Christian Education enabled subsequent generations of educators to bridge theological scholarship with educational practice, thus providing the groundwork for more professionalized and sustainable Christian education within churches and schools alike.\n\n\nTable 5.

Rooted in the values of solidarity, justice, and community, these Christian-led financial cooperatives offered a critical response to the harsh realities faced by laborers during a period of rapid industrialization and authoritarian rule. Protestant and Catholic churches, especially through the activities of Urban Industrial Missions (UIMs), played a pivotal role in both initiating and sustaining these grassroots economic initiatives.\n\nInitially, most credit unions were established within Catholic parish communities. For instance, in Incheon, the first credit union—Dapdong Credit Union—was founded in 1962 and was followed by similar organizations that relied on parish-based networks of trust. Of the ten credit unions established in Incheon during the 1960s, eight were formed by members of Catholic congregations. However, by the late 1960s, there was a marked transition from religious to workplace-based credit unions. This transformation began with the creation of the Daesung Credit Union in 1968, followed by the Incheon Heavy Industries Credit Union in 1969 and the Sanwoo Credit Union in 1970. These unions were established by workers in large factories and were heavily supported by the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission, which was affiliated with the Methodist Church. The UIM not only promoted these unions as a form of economic empowerment but also incorporated them into its broader mission of pastoral care and social justice.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Incheon had become home to 33 credit unions. Among them, eleven were organized through Catholic churches, five through Protestant denominations (mainly Methodist and Presbyterian), and thirteen were based on workplace solidarity. This progression from church-based to workplace-based models reflected a significant shift in the way community and solidarity were conceptualized and practiced. As one study notes, “Incheon exemplifies how the credit union movement, facilitated by the Christian Urban Industrial Mission, expanded from church-based networks to workplace and then to community-based solidarities.”\n\nA parallel movement unfolded in Yeongdeungpo, where the Yeongdeungpo Industrial Development Credit Union was founded in 1969 through the efforts of female factory workers closely connected to the Yeongdeungpo Urban Industrial Mission of the Presbyterian Church. The credit union addressed the severe financial exclusion faced by low-wage workers, many of whom had no access to bank loans and were forced to borrow from moneylenders at interest rates exceeding 72% annually. In contrast, the credit union offered loans at a much lower rate—around 24% per year—significantly easing the financial burdens of its members. This credit union, operated primarily by women, also became a site for democratic participation and social organization. Women laborers not only managed the financial operations but also led efforts to form consumer cooperatives, housing cooperatives, and other mutual aid organizations. The spirit of the movement was captured in the cooperative motto: “One for all, all for one.” As Pastor George Song, who led the mission, explained, “The labor union movement is a fight to earn more wages, while the credit union movement is a fight to protect what has been earned. They are essentially the same struggle.” Despite its success, the Yeongdeungpo credit union came under political pressure. In 1978, the government revoked its legal status after the union refused to comply with a financial audit, viewing it as an unjustified intrusion. The credit union responded by continuing its work as an unregistered cooperative called “Daramjwihoe” (Squirrel Society), maintaining its principles of economic solidarity and democratic governance in defiance of state repression.\n\nThese developments reveal how Christian missions in 1960s Korea went far beyond traditional evangelism. The Urban Industrial Missions embedded themselves in the lived realities of industrial workers, combining faith with concrete social action. Through the credit union movement, the church not only addressed immediate material needs but also fostered participatory structures that empowered marginalized communities. In doing so, the Christian credit union movement laid an early foundation for economic democratization and offered a compelling model of what a socially engaged gospel might look like in practice.\n\n\nCatholic Agrarian and Labor Movement\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, South Korea, under the Park Chung Hee regime, entered a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization, which structurally marginalized rural communities and farmers. In response to these social upheavals, the Catholic Church, influenced by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), began actively engaging in public issues based on its renewed focus on social justice and human dignity. The Church’s efforts to resolve the rural crisis centered on organizing farmers, founding cooperatives, and launching rural education programs. In this context, the Catholic Labor Youth Association (YCW) established a rural youth division in 1964, which later became the Korean Catholic Rural Youth Association in 1966. In 1972, this organization expanded into the Korean Catholic Farmers’ Movement (KCFM), which embraced adult farmers as well. Their movement combined spiritual beliefs with a pursuit of social justice through action. The movement was also closely connected with international Catholic organizations such as Misereor and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, and figures like Maria Sailer played critical roles in securing international financial and organizational support. In the latter half of the 1960s, Catholic agrarian movements took root through credit unions and farmer education initiatives. In Goesan County, Father Jang Je-nam (Clyde Davis) led the foundation of the Goesan Livestock Cooperative Association in 1968. It served not only as a livestock enterprise but also as a hub for farmer self-sufficiency, education, and community building. The association managed four pastures—Jungang, Baekyang, Goma, and Maejŏn—and expanded into credit unions and consumer cooperatives, later evolving into the Chungbuk Rural Development Association.\n\nMeanwhile, in Wonju, under the leadership of Bishop Ji Hak-sun, the Jingwang Cooperative Education Institute and Jingwang Credit Union were founded. Bishop Ji regarded cooperatives as a way to practice the Gospel in solidarity with the poor, describing them as a means for the Church to become more integrated with society. On the labor front, the Catholic Church also played a pivotal role in the 1966–68 textile labor movement on Ganghwa Island. Father Michael Bransfield, stationed at Ganghwa Parish, witnessed the dire working conditions of young women laborers and wrote to his Maryknoll superiors describing how “these young girls constantly bleed from the nose and collapse at their machines”. He requested assistance from the Catholic Labor Youth Association (JOC), which dispatched labor educator Song Ok-ja to organize female workers through catechetical and social education programs. On August 14, 1967, a labor union was established at Simdo Textile Factory, and the inaugural union ceremony was held in the convent of the local parish—a historically unprecedented event demonstrating the Church’s full support. The company responded with intimidation, firings, and threats, but union members continued to organize secretly, collecting signatures and mobilizing community support.\n\nRecognizing the severity of the conflict, Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan convened a National JOC Chaplains’ Meeting at Ganghwa Parish in July 1967. This marked the first ecumenical gathering involving Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant clergy to address labor issues collectively. Father Bransfield, at the conference, remarked, “What Koreans do not lack is knowledge of God, but rather a concern for the misery of human life and laborers’ suffering”. As the union expanded, the local employers' association began a collective boycott of Catholic workers, and the Simdo factory was shut down. The incident escalated to a national crisis, as employers and local political elites labeled the unionists as communists, while security forces surveilled and detained union leaders. Nonetheless, union head Park Bu-yang, initially appointed by management, became sympathetic to the workers and later led the resistance. Despite harsh repression, the labor union achieved its first collective agreement on November 4, 1967.\n\nThus, the Catholic agrarian and labor movements of the 1960s were not mere acts of charity or mission outreach but became acts of faith in action, confronting structural injustice in Korean society. Through cooperative organizing, labor solidarity, women's empowerment, and ecumenical collaboration, the Church underwent a fundamental transformation into an open and engaged community within Korean civil society.\n\n\nTable 7.

Korean Presbyterian churches, in particular, experienced repeated splits and reunification attempts, largely centered on differing stances regarding the World Council of Churches (WCC). The denomination eventually split into four major branches—Kosin, the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (PROK), Tonghap (the Presbyterian Church of Korea), and Hapdong—each establishing its own theological identity while also participating in interdenominational ecumenical efforts.\n\nJung Byung Joon notes, “All attempts at Presbyterian reunification during the 1960s failed, leaving deep wounds on both sides. Moreover, as each denomination was experiencing growth, they did not find reunification urgently necessary.” Nonetheless, he asserts, “it remains a crucial historical task to preserve the record of those processes and their meanings”. In 1959, a major schism occurred within the Presbyterian Church of Korea over its relationship with the WCC, resulting in a split between the Yeondong (later Tonghap) and Seungdong (later Hapdong) factions. Between 1960 and 1968, five reunification attempts were made but ultimately failed, and in 1969 the Tonghap denomination officially voted to rejoin the WCC. The first of these attempts, the 1959–1960 Yeondong-Seungdong reunification effort, fell apart due to unresolved differences. While the Yeondong faction confirmed its withdrawal from the WCC, it firmly rejected any alliance with the International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC). The Seungdong faction, meanwhile, adopted a more hardline position, demanding not only the cessation of WCC participation but also the dismissal of all Yeondong-appointed seminary faculty and a formal apology from the three foreign mission boards that supported the Yeondong General Assembly. Negotiations ultimately collapsed. A key figure reflected, “The Seungdong faction refused to reunite because they believed they would win the lawsuit. They thought that a legal victory would not only give them the seminary but also all church properties nationwide”. Despite this failure, ecumenical efforts persisted. In 1961, informal discussions began between Tonghap and the PROK, aiming at “reunion.” These efforts included pulpit exchanges and proposals for shared ministry. The PROK even passed a resolution stating its commitment to “strive for Presbyterian reunion through partial integration where possible,” though these efforts too were blocked by conservative forces. Meanwhile, debates over WCC re-affiliation intensified within the Tonghap denomination, culminating in its official decision to rejoin the WCC at the 54th General Assembly in 1969.\n\nThe theological underpinnings of the ecumenical movement during this period are reflected in WCC General Assembly themes. For example, the 1961 New Delhi Assembly was held under the theme “Jesus Christ, the Light of the World,” emphasizing the church’s calling to be a light amid global crises. According to Jung Byung Joon, this theme “called on churches to overcome division and engage in social witness in the light of Christ”. The 1968 Uppsala Assembly followed with the theme “Behold, I Make All Things New,” shifting the focus toward social participation and the church’s role in promoting justice.\n\nWithin the Korean church, a growing awareness of ecumenical identity also emerged. Ahn Kyo Seong described the Tonghap denomination as one that “understood itself as a church rooted in the ecumenical tradition of the 1907 Presbyterian Church in Korea,” and asserted that “ecumenicity is not merely about WCC affiliation but concerns the very essence of the church”. This ecumenical character was, in part, inherited from the interdenominational cooperation of early missionaries, which shaped the foundational ethos of the Korean church.\n\nWithin this historical context, Rev. Han Kyung-jik’s ministry stands as a practical embodiment of ecumenical spirit combined with evangelical commitment. His threefold mission of evangelism, education, and social service reflected a holistic vision of the church's mission. Rather than separating evangelism from social engagement, he maintained that “church social service should not remain at the level of temporary relief but should be carried out at a structural level”. Han did not view church growth or numerical increase as the sole purpose of mission; instead, he integrated social responsibility into the gospel’s witness.\n\nIn conclusion, the ecumenical movement in Korea during the 1960s, despite facing theological tensions and organizational setbacks, served as a critical period in which churches explored new forms of unity, expanded their theological horizons, and sought meaningful social engagement. The experiences of this decade laid the groundwork for deeper global partnerships, the integration of faith and justice, and the rediscovery of the public role of the church.\n\n\nMinjok Evangelization Movement\n\n\nThe Minjok Evangelization Movement that emerged in 1960s Korea was not merely a campaign to increase church membership or spread the gospel on an individual level. Rather, it represented an ambitious evangelical project aiming to save the entire Korean nation through the gospel and to reconstruct the state on Christian principles. Rooted in the traumatic experiences of national division, war, and ideological conflict, this movement was both a religious practice of healing and a theological-political attempt to fuse Christian mission with Korean nationalism and anti-communism. The ideological foundation of the movement can be traced to Rev. Han Kyung-chik, whose pastoral theology emphasized holistic transformation. As he stated in a 1947 sermon: “Evangelism is the greatest political movement, and anyone can participate in it. If we launch this evangelistic movement with Christian ideals and transform the mindset of the entire Korean people through Christian thought, then the righteous nation, an independent Christian Korea, will surely be realized.” For Han, evangelism was not confined to saving individual souls but aimed at initiating a spiritual revolution that would reform families, churches, society, and the nation. This philosophy materialized in the National Evangelization Movement of 1965, initiated by Han Kyung-chik and Kim Hwal-lan. Inspired by the Latin American model of “Evangelism-in-Depth,” this movement sought to mobilize all Korean churches in a nationwide, interdenominational gospel campaign. Han emphasized the importance of this effort, declaring, “If we designate 1965 as the Year of National Evangelization and launch a united movement encompassing all churches, this will not only benefit the church but also the nation and people.” \n\nAt the same time, the 1960s witnessed the rise of evangelical student mission organizations, with Kim Joon-gon’s Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) leading the way. Founded in 1958, CCC initially focused on campus ministry, but soon expanded its vision to encompass national transformation. In a 1971 CCC gathering, Kim declared, “Mobilizing two million Christians for evangelism is the fastest and most effective way to achieve national revolution and unification.” This perspective made evangelism the primary strategy for national salvation. CCC’s strategy was systematized through a threefold model of evangelism, discipleship, and mission-sending. While large-scale events like Explo ’74 would mark the climax of this vision in the 1970s, the strategic foundations were already being laid in the late 1960s. Under Kim’s leadership, CCC initiated mass evangelism training, local Bible study cells, and citywide spiritual campaigns such as the “Holy City Movement,” all of which reflected the logic of gospel-centered national transformation. \n\nMeanwhile, Han Kyung-chik promoted national evangelization through other means, including military and industrial mission work. His “Total Christianization of the Armed Forces” program, supported by the government, was framed as both a religious and anti-communist strategy. Conversely, his attempts to evangelize laborers through the Industrial Mission eventually met resistance due to conflicts over workers’ rights, culminating in Youngnak Church’s decision to end support for the movement in 1983. This illustrated the limitations of the movement in achieving structural social change, despite its success in fostering spiritual renewal. \n\nUltimately, the Minjok Evangelization Movement of the 1960s embodied a complex and dynamic synthesis of interchurch unity, evangelical revivalism, Christian nationalism, and anti-communism. While Han Kyung-chik focused on church unity and evangelism in the military and labor sectors, Kim Joon-gon and CCC built a highly structured student-centered mission network that aimed to disciple future national leaders. These efforts culminated in large-scale campaigns in the 1970s and played a decisive role in the rapid growth of Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nInterrelated Movements and the Minjok Evangelization Movement in 1960s\n\nThe Minjok Evangelization Movement of the 1960s was not an isolated campaign but a multifaceted evangelical response to Korea’s national division, rapid industrialization, and ideological polarization. It intersected with several key Christian movements of the time—urban industrial mission, Christian education reform, the ecumenical movement, and the Christian credit union movement. Each movement contributed to the broader framework of national evangelization in its own unique way.\n\n\nTable 8.  Connections with the Minjok Evangelization Movement\n\n| Movement Type | Connection to Minjok Evangelization Movement |\n| --- | --- |\n| Urban Industrial Mission | Practical application of evangelization in industrial labor contexts; highlighted limitations of evangelization when confronted with structural injustice. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Christian Education Movement | Provided institutional foundation for evangelization; linked gospel proclamation with leadership training and future national development. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ecumenical Movement | Enabled interdenominational unity; mobilized churches nationwide under a shared vision of national evangelization. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Christian Credit Union Movement | Embodied economic dimensions of gospel practice; extended evangelization to material conditions of life, especially among the working class and marginalized. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n\nThese interconnected movements reveal that the Minjok Evangelization Movement was not merely a spiritual or religious phenomenon. Rather, it functioned as an integrated evangelical praxis that extended into education, economic ethics, labor rights, and institutional church unity. Each movement provided complementary dimensions—urban mission grounded the gospel in real-life struggles; education ensured intergenerational continuity; ecumenism mobilized collective action; and credit unions translated spiritual ideals into economic justice. Together, these movements demonstrated that evangelization was envisioned as a holistic transformation of individuals, society, and nation. ",
