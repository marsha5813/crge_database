While outwardly the religion seemed to have vanished, in reality, a remnant of faithful believers persisted underground. Jooseop Keum describes this era as “The Winter of Christianity in North Korea,” spanning from 1958 to 1972, when Christianity was virtually banned and violently suppressed by the Communist regime. \n\nAs Keum explains, “From 1958 to 1972, Christianity in North Korea was effectively outlawed under the Anti-Religious Campaign, leading to the near-total disappearance of public religious life.” This Anti-Religious Campaign was both ideological and institutional, aimed at eliminating all forms of religion—including Buddhism and Shamanism—but especially targeting Christianity as a perceived ideological rival to Juche.\n\nBackground: Political and Ideological Suppression The campaign officially began in 1958, after the Christian boycott of the 1957 local elections, which the regime interpreted as a challenge to Kim Il-sung’s authority. Keum notes that even a small act of nonconformity was sufficient to initiate broad suppression: “Although the boycott was carried on in only one county, it was enough stimulation for Kim Il-sung and his followers to oppress the Christians throughout North Korea.” The ideological foundations were articulated in publications like Jung Ha-cheol’s Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959), which defined religion as “the opium of the people… a fatalistic ideology that weakens revolutionary spirit.” By 1959, the Korean Workers' Party had published six anti-religious booklets, systematically targeting Christianity for its links to American imperialism, its support for South Korea during the war, and its obstruction of socialist reconstruction.\n\nChristian leaders and laypersons were arrested, executed, or sent to forced labor camps. Underground churches in Pyongan and Hwanghae provinces were raided. In 1968, for example, members of a house church in Onchun County were arrested and deported to mines. The most far-reaching tactic of the Anti-Religious Campaign was the resident reclassification program, which lasted from 1958 to 1969. Citizens were grouped into three main classes—core, basic, and hostile—and into 51 sub-categories. Christians were typically placed in Section 38, labeled for “special observation.” Even Christians who supported the state could not hold high-ranking positions. According to Keum, “The total number of Protestant Christians dropped from 50,000 in 1953 to around 5,000 by 1972,” a loss of 90%, much of which can be attributed to forced apostasy, exile, execution, or despair.\n\nDespite persecution, many believers remained faithful. Keum uses the biblical metaphor of Isaiah’s holy remnant to describe their endurance: “The Christians in the North are considered theologically, on an analogue with the ‘remnants’ in Isaiah, as a ‘holy seed’ for the revival and renewal of Christianity in North Korea.” Christians held clandestine gatherings in house churches, which were often composed of small groups of fewer than ten people. In Kaesong, laypeople divided into eastern, western, and northern districts and began gathering in homes as early as 1954. A particularly moving account comes from Elder Se-yong Kang, daughter of a martyred pastor, who said she continued attending prayer meetings during the campaign period. Many believers prayed alone, memorized scripture, and maintained faith without clergy or formal sacraments. “Hundreds of house groups met in homes, worshipped and studied the Bible together, without ministers,” Keum writes.\n\nIn 1972, following a constitutional revision that loosened restrictions on religious activity, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) resumed public operations. Pyongyang Theological Seminary was reopened, individual Christians were urged to register, and two historic churches—Bongsu Church and Chilgol Church—were restored. By 1988, the number of house churches had grown to 511. This movement, Keum argues, was not merely a political accommodation but part of a deeper theological shift: “The revival of Protestant Christianity in North Korea was not the result of a compromising accommodation with the Communist government, but the consequence of its effective articulation of a minjung-centered approach.”\n\n ",
