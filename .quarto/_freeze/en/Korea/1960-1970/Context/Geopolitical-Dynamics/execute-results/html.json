The 1965 normalization of diplomatic relations through the Korea–Japan Basic Treaty triggered massive Christian backlash. Protestant and Catholic leaders—including Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and Kang Won-yong—publicly opposed the treaty, criticizing Japan’s lack of repentance and viewing the agreement as “a new form of economic colonialism.” This church-led protest marked the first major confrontation between Korean Christianity and the Park Chung Hee regime.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThough militarily and ideologically hostile to the South, North Korea remained a spiritual concern for many churches. The division of Korea after 1945 and the Korean War (1950–1953) framed North Korea as a “mission field of suffering.” Evangelical Christians in the South engaged in balloon leaflet campaigns, underground missionary networks, and prayers for reunification. However, these spiritual actions often heightened inter-Korean tensions.\n\n\nVietnam\n\nKorean churches largely supported the Vietnam War, echoing anti-communist theology. Protestant denominations sent military chaplains and morally sanctioned South Korea’s intervention. Yet some theologians later criticized this as a betrayal of Christian pacifism.\n\n\nRelationships with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\n\nUnited States\n\nThe U.S.–Korea alliance was not only military but spiritual. American missionaries, especially Presbyterians and Methodists, had laid the groundwork for Protestant growth. In the 1960s, conservative American evangelicals—like Billy Graham—forged deep ties with Korean revivalists such as Cho Yong-gi and Kim Jun-gon, supporting massive evangelistic rallies. Meanwhile, U.S.-based churches and Congressmen like Donald Fraser pressured the Park regime on human rights abuses, especially after the Inhyukdang and Mincheonghakryeon cases.\n\n\nGermany\n\nWest Germany offered asylum and scholarship to many dissident theologians during Park’s authoritarian era. The Basel Mission and German churches became important allies for Korean ecumenical movements. German Christian NGOs also financially supported urban and labor missions, especially in Yeongdeungpo’s urban ministry, linking church resistance to global civil society.\n\n\nCanada and Others\n\nCanadian Presbyterians supported theological education and sent missionaries, especially to rural areas. Christian ties also expanded to Australia, the Philippines, and Taiwan through ecumenical networks like CCA (Christian Conference of Asia).\n\n\nState of Patriotism and Nationalism in the 1960s\n\n\nThe 1960s were a paradoxical period for Korean nationalism—marked by state-led developmental patriotism, anti-communist nationalism, and growing civil resistance, with Christianity playing both cooperative and oppositional roles.\n\n\nState-Orchestrated Nationalism\n\nThe Park Chung Hee regime promoted a highly disciplined, anti-communist nationalism that relied on slogans like “anti-communism is our national policy” and “national reconstruction.” Through public rituals, such as anti-communist rallies, patriotic commemorations, and military parades, the state fostered a collective identity rooted in Cold War binaries. Churches, especially conservative ones, were compelled or persuaded to cooperate in these rituals.\n\nPress: Government-controlled media praised the regime’s development agenda, and Christian newspapers that questioned it (e.g., Christian Thought) were monitored or censored.\n\nPublic Rituals: The Presidential Prayer Breakfast, launched with cooperation from Kim Jun-gon and supported by Billy Graham’s team, became a state-sponsored display of pious nationalism, aligning Christianity with national reconstruction.\n\nYouth and Civic Engagement: State-funded groups like the Korean Christian Anti-Communist League encouraged Christian youth to partake in patriotic education and military service as divine duty.\n\n\nChurch-Based Nationalism and Civil Dissent\n\nDespite widespread conformity, progressive Christian networks provided a platform for alternative national visions:\n\nThe opposition to the 1965 Japan treaty, Korean involvement in the Vietnam War, and Park’s 1969 constitutional amendment (for a third term) all witnessed resistance led by ecumenical and student groups.\n\nNationalism took on a theological dimension in the form of Minjung theology (from the late 1960s onward), advocating for “a people-centered, justice-oriented nation” in contrast to militarized nationalism.\n\nChristian professors and students—especially through Christian Academy, Urban Industrial Missions, and KSCF (Korean Student Christian Federation)—articulated alternative patriotic narratives rooted in justice, human rights, and reunification.
