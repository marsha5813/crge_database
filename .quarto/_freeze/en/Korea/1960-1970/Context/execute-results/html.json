This period witnessed a decisive reordering of the religious landscape, in which the state not only repositioned the power balance among major religious traditions—Protestantism, Buddhism, and Catholicism—but also institutionalized and politicized religion as a tool of social control, ideological reproduction, and regime legitimacy.\n\nFollowing the April 1960 Revolution, the Second Republic, led by Prime Minister Chang Myon and President Yun Bo-seon, pledged to depart from the overt Protestant favoritism of the Syngman Rhee era. One of its first symbolic moves was to curtail the so-called Hyungmok System—a religious education framework that disproportionately favored Christian teachings in public schools. Chang, a devout Catholic, supported the removal of religious bias from state institutions and attempted to position the state as a neutral arbiter in religious affairs.\n\nHowever, the administration’s capacity to intervene constructively in religious disputes was severely limited. Nowhere was this more evident than in the Six Bhikkhus’ Seppuku Incident, which occurred in November 1960 at Gaeunsa Temple in Gwangju. In a dramatic protest against the dominance of married Buddhist clergy (taech’o), six celibate monks performed ritual disembowelment to draw national attention to the moral and doctrinal decay they perceived in postcolonial Korean Buddhism. The Second Republic, claiming neutrality, refrained from intervening. Yet this non-intervention effectively abdicated responsibility for mediating sectarian conflict and allowed the roots of systemic religious crisis to deepen. This failure to regulate religion during the Second Republic laid the groundwork for the Park Chung-hee regime’s more aggressive religious policy. After the 1961 military coup, Park moved quickly to consolidate state power, and religion became both a target and a tool in that consolidation process. In 1962, his government enacted the Buddhist Property Management Act, which required Buddhist temples to register as juridical entities and subjected their financial activities to government oversight. This law signaled the state’s attempt to tame Buddhist institutions by embedding them in bureaucratic structures, effectively subordinating them to the goals of developmental nationalism.\n\nFrom 1965 onward, Park’s regime began actively cultivating a close relationship with the Protestant community, particularly its evangelical and anti-communist branches. That year, the inaugural Presidential Prayer Breakfast was held—an event that would become an annual ritual of religious legitimation. By 1969, Park himself began attending the breakfasts, projecting the image of a morally upright, God-fearing leader who governed not only by law but by providence. This partnership was not merely symbolic. During the Vietnam War, the government’s troop deployment policy was enthusiastically supported by Protestant churches. Across the country, “National Salvation Prayer Meetings” were organized to bless soldiers, condemn communism, and equate patriotism with Christian faith. A particularly large prayer rally held in 1971 in Yeouido drew over 300,000 people and was interpreted by many as a fusion of evangelical fervor and patriotic duty. The zenith of this alliance came in 1973 with Billy Graham’s crusade in Seoul, where more than one million people gathered in Yeouido Plaza. Organized with the logistical support of the government, the event not only symbolized Protestantism’s ascendance but also projected an image of South Korea as a Christian, anti-communist beacon in Asia. As historian Keun-Young Lee notes, “The crusade served as a carefully staged convergence of global evangelicalism, authoritarian nationalism, and Cold War ideology.”\n\nWhile Protestantism flourished, the state continued to institutionalize other religious traditions as well, albeit on different terms. In 1968, the military chaplain system was officially codified, restricting participation to the three “recognized” religions: Protestantism, Buddhism, and Catholicism. In 1969, Buddhism gained further ground when the Buddhist Military Chaplain Corps was formally established. In 1975, the Park government designated Buddha’s Birthday as a national holiday, completing a cycle of public recognition that had begun with bureaucratic control.\n\nYet the autonomy of Buddhism remained compromised. In 1977, pro-government Buddhist lawmakers formed the Jeonggakhoe, an organization that coordinated Buddhist support for state policy. By 1979, Buddhist leaders were conducting ceremonial prayer rites for the president himself—demonstrating how thoroughly the tradition had been co-opted into the regime’s symbolic order.\n\nMeanwhile, Protestantism experienced explosive demographic growth. Census data shows that the Protestant population grew from approximately 1.5 million in 1960 to over 7 million by 1973, and 9.6 million by 1985. This expansion was fueled not only by spiritual fervor but also by the structural privileges Protestants enjoyed: dominance in military chaplaincies, favored access to public education and broadcasting, and proximity to elite political and economic circles.\n\nThe ideological synergy between Park’s developmental nationalism and Protestant revivalism was particularly evident in the parallel messaging of the Saemaul (New Village) Movement and the early morning prayer movement. Both promoted self-discipline, moral reform, and nation-building through faith—faith in God, and in the nation. As theologian Park Myung-soo observes, “The Saemaul Movement was the national version of early morning prayer, and early morning prayer was the devotional version of Saemaul.” This symbiosis between church and state was not without risk. While it brought institutional benefits and cultural prominence to the Protestant community, it also blurred the lines between prophetic witness and political complicity. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, the alignment between Park Chung-hee’s authoritarian regime and Protestant Christianity laid the foundation for one of the most consequential and controversial alliances in Korea’s modern religious history.\n\n\nTable 1.

During this period, the regime no longer needed to suppress a visible, organized church—because it had effectively dismantled one. Instead, it focused on eliminating remnants of underground religious life, intensifying atheism campaigns, and rebranding religion as a tool for external diplomacy.\n\n\nStrengthened Atheism and the Institutional Disappearance of Christianity\n\nNorth Korea’s official stance in the early 1960s remained consistent with Marxist–Leninist atheism. One of the regime’s key ideological texts, Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959) by Chong Ha-chol, declared:\n\n“We must heighten revolutionary vigilance to prevent the further infiltration of religious influence. We must promptly identify, expose, and punish the anti-revolutionary activities of reactionary religious elements still lurking in the northern half of the Republic.”\n\nThe regime institutionalized this atheism through cultural production and propaganda. The 1966 film Choi Hak-shin’s Family portrayed Christianity as an instrument of American imperialism and national betrayal, reinforcing the idea that religious faith was a threat to socialist progress. These messages were disseminated throughout schools, workplaces, and local political meetings, solidifying the image of religion as anti-socialist. By this time, all official Christian activity had ceased—a fact recorded by defectors and confirmed in scholarly research. From 1958 until at least the early 1970s, public worship, pastoral ministry, and church functions no longer existed in any legal form.\n\n\nSuppression of Underground Religious Practices: Key Cases\n\nDespite the suppression of official religion, small pockets of underground believers continued to practice their faith, often secretly. These groups were met with harsh punishment.\n\n1957: In Yongcheon County, Pastor Lee Man-hwa refused to participate in national elections and was punished for anti-socialist behavior.\n\n1959: A teacher in Pakcheon County was caught teaching hymns to children at her home and was dismissed.\n\n1960: A wooden cross was discovered at the Wonsan Railway Factory, prompting an investigation into hidden religious activities.\n\nSuch cases underscore that even minimal, private expressions of Christian belief were criminalized and subjected to state discipline.\n\n\nMaintenance of Religious Organizations for Political Utility\n\nBy the mid-1960s, North Korea began to transition from outright elimination to symbolic preservation of religious organizations. Groups such as the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and the Korean Buddhist Federation were retained in name only. These organizations had no grassroots membership or independent function but were instead “state-dominated structures preserved solely for external mobilization.” This shift coincided with North Korea’s evolving strategy of South–North diplomacy and inter-Korean peace overtures. Religious organizations were reactivated not for worship, but for participation in political dialogues and international events—such as inter-Korean religious meetings and peace forums. Their existence served the regime’s image of “religious freedom” to foreign observers.\n\nThe religious policy of the 1960s did not merely repress belief—it functionally dissolved religion as an active social force. Christians were reclassified in official documents as part of the “hostile or wavering class,” meaning they faced ongoing disadvantages in education, employment, and residency rights.\n\nIn short, religion survived neither as faith nor as institution, but as an empty structure appropriated by the state. What remained was a system in which faith could exist only as silence, and religious organizations functioned as ideological instruments.\n\n\nTable 2.  Timeline: Key Events and Policy Shifts\n\n\n| Year | Event / Policy | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1959 | Publication of \"Why Do We Oppose Religion?\" | Chong Ha-chol’s ideological treatise laid the foundation for atheism campaigns by framing religion as anti-revolutionary. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1959 | Hymnal Instruction Incident in Pakcheon County | An elementary school teacher was caught teaching hymns to students at home and was penalized. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960 | Wonsan Railway Factory Cross Incident | A wooden cross was found at the factory, prompting investigations into underground Christian activities. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1962–1964 | Cessation of Religious Organizational Activity | Groups like the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) ceased public functions and became symbolic entities only. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1966 | Release of the Anti-Christian Film \"Choi Hak-shin’s Family\" | A propaganda film portraying Christianity as a tool of American imperialism and a betrayal of the nation. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1968–1969 | Revival of Religious Organizations for External Use | Religious groups were reactivated for inter-Korean dialogue and international appearances in support of North Korean diplomacy. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nInter-Korean Unification Policies and Religious Roles: Political Silence and Religious Inertia\n\nFollowing the April Revolution, the Chang Myon government promoted UN-supervised elections as a unification method. However, after the 1961 coup, the Park Chung-hee regime emphasized economic development over reunification, asserting that material strength was a prerequisite for unification. Protestant churches largely complied with this framework and showed little initiative regarding national reconciliation.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea began conceptualizing a federal unification system, where both Koreas would maintain their own systems under a joint body. Despite this theoretical shift, religion remained tightly controlled and most churches were forced underground. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nSouth Korea\n\nIn 1960s South Korea, Christianity—particularly Protestantism—faced growing public scrutiny and complex relationships with both state and society. These tensions did not stem from a single source but reflected the broader upheavals of a society transitioning from postwar recovery to rapid industrialization under military rule. Social hostility toward Christianity, while significant in certain sectors, coexisted with efforts by Christian communities to actively engage with Korean society and contribute to national development.\n\nOne major source of tension arose from the increasing political involvement of Christian leaders and organizations. Groups such as the Korean Christian Academy, the Christian Professors Association, and the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) became vocal in advocating for democracy, social justice, and human rights. These activities sometimes brought them into conflict with the military government, which viewed politically active religious groups with suspicion. Nevertheless, it is important to note that not all Christian organizations were oppositional; some denominations and prominent pastors, such as Han Kyung-jik, maintained cooperative relationships with the state and supported national stability during this turbulent period. \n\nCultural tensions also shaped perceptions of Christianity. Although the religion had gained substantial urban followings, especially among students and intellectuals, some segments of Korean society still viewed it as foreign or insufficiently rooted in traditional values. However, theologians such as Yoo Dong-sik attempted to reinterpret Christian theology in ways that resonated with Korean religious sensibilities. Yoo argued that the Gospel must be understood through categories familiar to Koreans, such as do (道) rather than logos, proposing that “an overly Westernized conceptual framework could obscure the essence of the Gospel in Korea.” Such theological developments contributed meaningfully to indigenizing Christianity.\n\nAt the same time, Christian institutions made notable efforts to serve Korean society in concrete and transformative ways. For example, the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative, led by Presbyterian surgeon Jang Gi-ryeo, provided affordable healthcare to low-income families based on Christian principles of equality and service. It was “a democratic, non-profit model” that emphasized inclusion regardless of social class, age, or pre-existing conditions. In the economic sphere, Christian leaders helped expand the Credit Union Movement, which promoted grassroots savings and mutual aid—especially among factory workers—in alignment with Catholic social teaching and Protestant ethics of stewardship.\n\nChristianity also played a prominent role in education. In Daejeon, for instance, over 70% of kindergarten students in 1961 were enrolled in Protestant-affiliated schools. Christian educators contributed to rebuilding and modernizing Korea’s postwar education system, emphasizing moral education, civic responsibility, and democratic values.\n\nIn sum, while Christianity in the 1960s encountered social skepticism—particularly regarding its political activism and perceived Western character—it also made commendable strides in contextual theology, community development, education, and healthcare. The period thus represents not simply one of confrontation, but of negotiation and integration, in which Christian institutions contributed constructively to Korea’s modernization, even as they navigated the challenges of authoritarianism and cultural tension.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nIn 1960s North Korea, Christianity existed in an environment of extreme social hostility and systematic suppression. The North Korean state, based on Juche ideology and committed to building a socialist, monolithic society, regarded organized religion as an existential threat to its ideological control. As a result, all religious activities, including Christianity, were either eradicated or driven underground.\n\nBy this time, the remnants of the once-thriving Protestant and Catholic communities had largely vanished from public life. According to historian Keum Jooseop, “Christianity in the 1960s survived in North Korea only in hidden and highly fragmented forms,” with only a small number of known state-sanctioned churches remaining in Pyongyang, likely for symbolic and diplomatic purposes. The Korean Christian Federation (KCF), founded in 1946, continued to function during this decade, but scholars widely agree that it operated under the close supervision of the Workers’ Party and served as a controlled religious organ rather than a genuinely autonomous religious body.\n\nThe social hostility toward Christianity was not limited to institutional suppression but extended to individuals and families. Christians were routinely labeled as hostile elements (gyohakbunja, 교학분자), were excluded from Party membership, and faced limitations in education, employment, and residence. Many were sent to rural labor camps, prisons, or subjected to public criticism sessions. As Kim Seong-tae explains, “Christian identity was tantamount to political treason, and survival required either secrecy or renunciation of faith”. Despite this climate of repression, there is evidence of persistent faith among so-called “remnant Christians.” These were individuals or families who maintained clandestine religious practices, often passing on the faith through oral transmission and household worship. Testimonies from defectors and underground missionary sources indicate that some believers continued to pray in secret, hide Bibles, and baptize children despite the risk of imprisonment or execution. While integration into North Korean society was virtually impossible for Christians due to ideological exclusion, the very persistence of faith under such circumstances speaks to a form of spiritual resistance and cultural memory.\n\nIn summary, the 1960s represented a period of near-total erasure of public Christianity in North Korea, marked by severe state hostility and ideological persecution. Yet, beneath this repression, small pockets of hidden believers remained, embodying a resilient—if marginalized—form of faith. Their survival would later form the foundation for reports of revival in the 1970s, as North Korea sought limited re-engagement with religious organizations abroad. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nDiplomatic Relationships with Neighboring Asia-Pacific Countries (Christianity-Relevant)\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, South Korea’s regional diplomacy was deeply shaped by Cold War dynamics, anti-communism, and developmental nationalism—each intersecting with Christian interests.\n\nJapan\n\nKorea’s historical resentment toward Japan’s colonial rule (1910–1945) persisted into the 1960s. The 1965 normalization of diplomatic relations through the Korea–Japan Basic Treaty triggered massive Christian backlash. Protestant and Catholic leaders—including Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and Kang Won-yong—publicly opposed the treaty, criticizing Japan’s lack of repentance and viewing the agreement as “a new form of economic colonialism.” This church-led protest marked the first major confrontation between Korean Christianity and the Park Chung Hee regime.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThough militarily and ideologically hostile to the South, North Korea remained a spiritual concern for many churches. The division of Korea after 1945 and the Korean War (1950–1953) framed North Korea as a “mission field of suffering.” Evangelical Christians in the South engaged in balloon leaflet campaigns, underground missionary networks, and prayers for reunification. However, these spiritual actions often heightened inter-Korean tensions.\n\n\nVietnam\n\nKorean churches largely supported the Vietnam War, echoing anti-communist theology. Protestant denominations sent military chaplains and morally sanctioned South Korea’s intervention. Yet some theologians later criticized this as a betrayal of Christian pacifism.\n\n\nRelationships with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\n\nUnited States\n\nThe U.S.–Korea alliance was not only military but spiritual. American missionaries, especially Presbyterians and Methodists, had laid the groundwork for Protestant growth. In the 1960s, conservative American evangelicals—like Billy Graham—forged deep ties with Korean revivalists such as Cho Yong-gi and Kim Jun-gon, supporting massive evangelistic rallies. Meanwhile, U.S.-based churches and Congressmen like Donald Fraser pressured the Park regime on human rights abuses, especially after the Inhyukdang and Mincheonghakryeon cases.\n\n\nGermany\n\nWest Germany offered asylum and scholarship to many dissident theologians during Park’s authoritarian era. The Basel Mission and German churches became important allies for Korean ecumenical movements. German Christian NGOs also financially supported urban and labor missions, especially in Yeongdeungpo’s urban ministry, linking church resistance to global civil society.\n\n\nCanada and Others\n\nCanadian Presbyterians supported theological education and sent missionaries, especially to rural areas. Christian ties also expanded to Australia, the Philippines, and Taiwan through ecumenical networks like CCA (Christian Conference of Asia).\n\n\nState of Patriotism and Nationalism in the 1960s\n\n\nThe 1960s were a paradoxical period for Korean nationalism—marked by state-led developmental patriotism, anti-communist nationalism, and growing civil resistance, with Christianity playing both cooperative and oppositional roles.\n\n\nState-Orchestrated Nationalism\n\nThe Park Chung Hee regime promoted a highly disciplined, anti-communist nationalism that relied on slogans like “anti-communism is our national policy” and “national reconstruction.” Through public rituals, such as anti-communist rallies, patriotic commemorations, and military parades, the state fostered a collective identity rooted in Cold War binaries. Churches, especially conservative ones, were compelled or persuaded to cooperate in these rituals.\n\nPress: Government-controlled media praised the regime’s development agenda, and Christian newspapers that questioned it (e.g., Christian Thought) were monitored or censored.\n\nPublic Rituals: The Presidential Prayer Breakfast, launched with cooperation from Kim Jun-gon and supported by Billy Graham’s team, became a state-sponsored display of pious nationalism, aligning Christianity with national reconstruction.\n\nYouth and Civic Engagement: State-funded groups like the Korean Christian Anti-Communist League encouraged Christian youth to partake in patriotic education and military service as divine duty.\n\n\nChurch-Based Nationalism and Civil Dissent\n\nDespite widespread conformity, progressive Christian networks provided a platform for alternative national visions:\n\nThe opposition to the 1965 Japan treaty, Korean involvement in the Vietnam War, and Park’s 1969 constitutional amendment (for a third term) all witnessed resistance led by ecumenical and student groups.\n\nNationalism took on a theological dimension in the form of Minjung theology (from the late 1960s onward), advocating for “a people-centered, justice-oriented nation” in contrast to militarized nationalism.\n\nChristian professors and students—especially through Christian Academy, Urban Industrial Missions, and KSCF (Korean Student Christian Federation)—articulated alternative patriotic narratives rooted in justice, human rights, and reunification. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nlark, Donald N.
