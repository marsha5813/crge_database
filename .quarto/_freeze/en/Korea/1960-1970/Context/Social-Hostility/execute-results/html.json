These tensions did not stem from a single source but reflected the broader upheavals of a society transitioning from postwar recovery to rapid industrialization under military rule. Social hostility toward Christianity, while significant in certain sectors, coexisted with efforts by Christian communities to actively engage with Korean society and contribute to national development.\n\nOne major source of tension arose from the increasing political involvement of Christian leaders and organizations. Groups such as the Korean Christian Academy, the Christian Professors Association, and the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) became vocal in advocating for democracy, social justice, and human rights. These activities sometimes brought them into conflict with the military government, which viewed politically active religious groups with suspicion. Nevertheless, it is important to note that not all Christian organizations were oppositional; some denominations and prominent pastors, such as Han Kyung-jik, maintained cooperative relationships with the state and supported national stability during this turbulent period. \n\nCultural tensions also shaped perceptions of Christianity. Although the religion had gained substantial urban followings, especially among students and intellectuals, some segments of Korean society still viewed it as foreign or insufficiently rooted in traditional values. However, theologians such as Yoo Dong-sik attempted to reinterpret Christian theology in ways that resonated with Korean religious sensibilities. Yoo argued that the Gospel must be understood through categories familiar to Koreans, such as do (道) rather than logos, proposing that “an overly Westernized conceptual framework could obscure the essence of the Gospel in Korea.” Such theological developments contributed meaningfully to indigenizing Christianity.\n\nAt the same time, Christian institutions made notable efforts to serve Korean society in concrete and transformative ways. For example, the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative, led by Presbyterian surgeon Jang Gi-ryeo, provided affordable healthcare to low-income families based on Christian principles of equality and service. It was “a democratic, non-profit model” that emphasized inclusion regardless of social class, age, or pre-existing conditions. In the economic sphere, Christian leaders helped expand the Credit Union Movement, which promoted grassroots savings and mutual aid—especially among factory workers—in alignment with Catholic social teaching and Protestant ethics of stewardship.\n\nChristianity also played a prominent role in education. In Daejeon, for instance, over 70% of kindergarten students in 1961 were enrolled in Protestant-affiliated schools. Christian educators contributed to rebuilding and modernizing Korea’s postwar education system, emphasizing moral education, civic responsibility, and democratic values.\n\nIn sum, while Christianity in the 1960s encountered social skepticism—particularly regarding its political activism and perceived Western character—it also made commendable strides in contextual theology, community development, education, and healthcare. The period thus represents not simply one of confrontation, but of negotiation and integration, in which Christian institutions contributed constructively to Korea’s modernization, even as they navigated the challenges of authoritarianism and cultural tension.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nIn 1960s North Korea, Christianity existed in an environment of extreme social hostility and systematic suppression. The North Korean state, based on Juche ideology and committed to building a socialist, monolithic society, regarded organized religion as an existential threat to its ideological control. As a result, all religious activities, including Christianity, were either eradicated or driven underground.\n\nBy this time, the remnants of the once-thriving Protestant and Catholic communities had largely vanished from public life. According to historian Keum Jooseop, “Christianity in the 1960s survived in North Korea only in hidden and highly fragmented forms,” with only a small number of known state-sanctioned churches remaining in Pyongyang, likely for symbolic and diplomatic purposes. The Korean Christian Federation (KCF), founded in 1946, continued to function during this decade, but scholars widely agree that it operated under the close supervision of the Workers’ Party and served as a controlled religious organ rather than a genuinely autonomous religious body.\n\nThe social hostility toward Christianity was not limited to institutional suppression but extended to individuals and families. Christians were routinely labeled as hostile elements (gyohakbunja, 교학분자), were excluded from Party membership, and faced limitations in education, employment, and residence. Many were sent to rural labor camps, prisons, or subjected to public criticism sessions. As Kim Seong-tae explains, “Christian identity was tantamount to political treason, and survival required either secrecy or renunciation of faith”. Despite this climate of repression, there is evidence of persistent faith among so-called “remnant Christians.” These were individuals or families who maintained clandestine religious practices, often passing on the faith through oral transmission and household worship. Testimonies from defectors and underground missionary sources indicate that some believers continued to pray in secret, hide Bibles, and baptize children despite the risk of imprisonment or execution. While integration into North Korean society was virtually impossible for Christians due to ideological exclusion, the very persistence of faith under such circumstances speaks to a form of spiritual resistance and cultural memory.\n\nIn summary, the 1960s represented a period of near-total erasure of public Christianity in North Korea, marked by severe state hostility and ideological persecution. Yet, beneath this repression, small pockets of hidden believers remained, embodying a resilient—if marginalized—form of faith. Their survival would later form the foundation for reports of revival in the 1970s, as North Korea sought limited re-engagement with religious organizations abroad. ",
