This period witnessed a decisive reordering of the religious landscape, in which the state not only repositioned the power balance among major religious traditions—Protestantism, Buddhism, and Catholicism—but also institutionalized and politicized religion as a tool of social control, ideological reproduction, and regime legitimacy.\n\nFollowing the April 1960 Revolution, the Second Republic, led by Prime Minister Chang Myon and President Yun Bo-seon, pledged to depart from the overt Protestant favoritism of the Syngman Rhee era. One of its first symbolic moves was to curtail the so-called Hyungmok System—a religious education framework that disproportionately favored Christian teachings in public schools. Chang, a devout Catholic, supported the removal of religious bias from state institutions and attempted to position the state as a neutral arbiter in religious affairs.\n\nHowever, the administration’s capacity to intervene constructively in religious disputes was severely limited. Nowhere was this more evident than in the Six Bhikkhus’ Seppuku Incident, which occurred in November 1960 at Gaeunsa Temple in Gwangju. In a dramatic protest against the dominance of married Buddhist clergy (taech’o), six celibate monks performed ritual disembowelment to draw national attention to the moral and doctrinal decay they perceived in postcolonial Korean Buddhism. The Second Republic, claiming neutrality, refrained from intervening. Yet this non-intervention effectively abdicated responsibility for mediating sectarian conflict and allowed the roots of systemic religious crisis to deepen. This failure to regulate religion during the Second Republic laid the groundwork for the Park Chung-hee regime’s more aggressive religious policy. After the 1961 military coup, Park moved quickly to consolidate state power, and religion became both a target and a tool in that consolidation process. In 1962, his government enacted the Buddhist Property Management Act, which required Buddhist temples to register as juridical entities and subjected their financial activities to government oversight. This law signaled the state’s attempt to tame Buddhist institutions by embedding them in bureaucratic structures, effectively subordinating them to the goals of developmental nationalism.\n\nFrom 1965 onward, Park’s regime began actively cultivating a close relationship with the Protestant community, particularly its evangelical and anti-communist branches. That year, the inaugural Presidential Prayer Breakfast was held—an event that would become an annual ritual of religious legitimation. By 1969, Park himself began attending the breakfasts, projecting the image of a morally upright, God-fearing leader who governed not only by law but by providence. This partnership was not merely symbolic. During the Vietnam War, the government’s troop deployment policy was enthusiastically supported by Protestant churches. Across the country, “National Salvation Prayer Meetings” were organized to bless soldiers, condemn communism, and equate patriotism with Christian faith. A particularly large prayer rally held in 1971 in Yeouido drew over 300,000 people and was interpreted by many as a fusion of evangelical fervor and patriotic duty. The zenith of this alliance came in 1973 with Billy Graham’s crusade in Seoul, where more than one million people gathered in Yeouido Plaza. Organized with the logistical support of the government, the event not only symbolized Protestantism’s ascendance but also projected an image of South Korea as a Christian, anti-communist beacon in Asia. As historian Keun-Young Lee notes, “The crusade served as a carefully staged convergence of global evangelicalism, authoritarian nationalism, and Cold War ideology.”\n\nWhile Protestantism flourished, the state continued to institutionalize other religious traditions as well, albeit on different terms. In 1968, the military chaplain system was officially codified, restricting participation to the three “recognized” religions: Protestantism, Buddhism, and Catholicism. In 1969, Buddhism gained further ground when the Buddhist Military Chaplain Corps was formally established. In 1975, the Park government designated Buddha’s Birthday as a national holiday, completing a cycle of public recognition that had begun with bureaucratic control.\n\nYet the autonomy of Buddhism remained compromised. In 1977, pro-government Buddhist lawmakers formed the Jeonggakhoe, an organization that coordinated Buddhist support for state policy. By 1979, Buddhist leaders were conducting ceremonial prayer rites for the president himself—demonstrating how thoroughly the tradition had been co-opted into the regime’s symbolic order.\n\nMeanwhile, Protestantism experienced explosive demographic growth. Census data shows that the Protestant population grew from approximately 1.5 million in 1960 to over 7 million by 1973, and 9.6 million by 1985. This expansion was fueled not only by spiritual fervor but also by the structural privileges Protestants enjoyed: dominance in military chaplaincies, favored access to public education and broadcasting, and proximity to elite political and economic circles.\n\nThe ideological synergy between Park’s developmental nationalism and Protestant revivalism was particularly evident in the parallel messaging of the Saemaul (New Village) Movement and the early morning prayer movement. Both promoted self-discipline, moral reform, and nation-building through faith—faith in God, and in the nation. As theologian Park Myung-soo observes, “The Saemaul Movement was the national version of early morning prayer, and early morning prayer was the devotional version of Saemaul.” This symbiosis between church and state was not without risk. While it brought institutional benefits and cultural prominence to the Protestant community, it also blurred the lines between prophetic witness and political complicity. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, the alignment between Park Chung-hee’s authoritarian regime and Protestant Christianity laid the foundation for one of the most consequential and controversial alliances in Korea’s modern religious history.\n\n\nTable 1.

During this period, the regime no longer needed to suppress a visible, organized church—because it had effectively dismantled one. Instead, it focused on eliminating remnants of underground religious life, intensifying atheism campaigns, and rebranding religion as a tool for external diplomacy.\n\n\nStrengthened Atheism and the Institutional Disappearance of Christianity\n\nNorth Korea’s official stance in the early 1960s remained consistent with Marxist–Leninist atheism. One of the regime’s key ideological texts, Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959) by Chong Ha-chol, declared:\n\n“We must heighten revolutionary vigilance to prevent the further infiltration of religious influence. We must promptly identify, expose, and punish the anti-revolutionary activities of reactionary religious elements still lurking in the northern half of the Republic.”\n\nThe regime institutionalized this atheism through cultural production and propaganda. The 1966 film Choi Hak-shin’s Family portrayed Christianity as an instrument of American imperialism and national betrayal, reinforcing the idea that religious faith was a threat to socialist progress. These messages were disseminated throughout schools, workplaces, and local political meetings, solidifying the image of religion as anti-socialist. By this time, all official Christian activity had ceased—a fact recorded by defectors and confirmed in scholarly research. From 1958 until at least the early 1970s, public worship, pastoral ministry, and church functions no longer existed in any legal form.\n\n\nSuppression of Underground Religious Practices: Key Cases\n\nDespite the suppression of official religion, small pockets of underground believers continued to practice their faith, often secretly. These groups were met with harsh punishment.\n\n1957: In Yongcheon County, Pastor Lee Man-hwa refused to participate in national elections and was punished for anti-socialist behavior.\n\n1959: A teacher in Pakcheon County was caught teaching hymns to children at her home and was dismissed.\n\n1960: A wooden cross was discovered at the Wonsan Railway Factory, prompting an investigation into hidden religious activities.\n\nSuch cases underscore that even minimal, private expressions of Christian belief were criminalized and subjected to state discipline.\n\n\nMaintenance of Religious Organizations for Political Utility\n\nBy the mid-1960s, North Korea began to transition from outright elimination to symbolic preservation of religious organizations. Groups such as the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and the Korean Buddhist Federation were retained in name only. These organizations had no grassroots membership or independent function but were instead “state-dominated structures preserved solely for external mobilization.” This shift coincided with North Korea’s evolving strategy of South–North diplomacy and inter-Korean peace overtures. Religious organizations were reactivated not for worship, but for participation in political dialogues and international events—such as inter-Korean religious meetings and peace forums. Their existence served the regime’s image of “religious freedom” to foreign observers.\n\nThe religious policy of the 1960s did not merely repress belief—it functionally dissolved religion as an active social force. Christians were reclassified in official documents as part of the “hostile or wavering class,” meaning they faced ongoing disadvantages in education, employment, and residency rights.\n\nIn short, religion survived neither as faith nor as institution, but as an empty structure appropriated by the state. What remained was a system in which faith could exist only as silence, and religious organizations functioned as ideological instruments.\n\n\nTable 2.

However, after the 1961 coup, the Park Chung-hee regime emphasized economic development over reunification, asserting that material strength was a prerequisite for unification. Protestant churches largely complied with this framework and showed little initiative regarding national reconciliation.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea began conceptualizing a federal unification system, where both Koreas would maintain their own systems under a joint body. Despite this theoretical shift, religion remained tightly controlled and most churches were forced underground.\n\n\n ",
