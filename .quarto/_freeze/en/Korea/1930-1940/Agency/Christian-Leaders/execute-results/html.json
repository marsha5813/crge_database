During the Independence Association Incident from 1902 to 1904, they were imprisoned along with other leaders of the Independence Association, including Lee Sang-jae. It was during this time in prison that they came into contact with Christianity and converted. \n\nContribution: Namgung-Eok was a scholar, diplomat, independence activist, founder of the Hwangseong Shinmun newspaper, and an educator during the Joseon Dynasty. In the 1930s, he played a role as an independence activist who protected the rose of Sharon (Mugunghwa) flower.\n\nThe exact date when Mugunghwa became the national flower of South Korea is not known, but according to an article in the Chosun Ilbo on February 25, 1969, it is said that Namgung-Eok, while serving as Chilgok Busa (a local official), decided to designate Mugunghwa as the national flower after consulting with Yun Chi-ho. He was also the lyricist for the first song of the hymn \"삼천리반도 금수강산\" (\"Samcheolli Bando Geumsugangsan\"), which was later modified to become part of the South Korean national anthem.\n\nIn 1897, during the celebration of the founding of Korea organized by the Independence Association (Dongnip Hyophoe), students of Baejae Hakdang (an educational institution) first sang \"무궁화가\" (\"Mugunghwaga\"), which later became the national flower song. The lyrics of the song symbolized the Korean people's aspirations for independence. Mugunghwa has been a symbol of the Korean people's spirit and has deep historical roots in Korean culture. It has been mentioned in ancient texts and poetry throughout Korean history.\n\nMugunghwa Distribution Movement: The starting point of the Mugunghwa (rose of Sharon) distribution movement was during Namgung-Eok's tenure at Baejae Hakdang, where he provided embroidery education to female students on the rose of Sharon. The Japanese authorities strictly prohibited any use or representation of the rose of Sharon, including in students' uniforms and hats. However, despite Japanese oppression, Namgung-Eok devised a method to introduce the rose of Sharon to female students at Baejae Hakdang. He had them embroider a map of Korea, symbolizing Geumsugangsan (Mount Baekdu), onto silk fabric, and embroidered a rose of Sharon in each of the 13 provinces (do) to represent the 13 provinces of Korea. Through rose of Sharon embroidery, the students developed a sense of national identity, and their influence grew significantly, with Baejae Hakdang students playing a significant role in the March 1st Movement (Sam-il Movement).\n\nMugunghwa Distribution through Planting: In the aftermath of the March 1st Movement in 1919, during Governor-General Saito Makoto's \"cultural policy,\" Namgung-Eok began planting rose of Sharon saplings at locations where people gathered, such as parks and schoolyards. The Japanese authorities had previously uprooted the rose of Sharon and replaced it with cherry blossoms (sakura), claiming it as their own flower. Namgung-Eok started cultivating rose of Sharon saplings at Mogok School's practice field, making significant contributions to the practical distribution of the rose of Sharon. When Japanese officials or police visited schools, young Mugunghwa saplings were disguised as mulberry trees to avoid detection. Every year, thousands of Mugunghwa saplings were grown and donated to private schools, churches, and social organizations across the country.\n\nMugunghwa Distribution through Games: In the popular drama \"Squid Game,\" there is a game where participants shout, \"무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다!\" (\"The rose of Sharon has bloomed!\"). This game originated from a Japanese children's game called \"ダルマさんがころんだ\" (\"Daruma-san ga koronda\"). The transformation of this game into a symbol of Korea, shouting \"무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다!\" (\"Mugunghwa has bloomed!\"), has a significant reason behind it. Namgung-Eok, who had dedicated himself to the distribution of the rose of Sharon, witnessed Korean children playing the Japanese game \"Daruma-san ga koronda\" in the streets, unable to use the Korean language or engage in Korean games. He called the children over and warmly said, \"You may have no choice but to play the Japanese game, but let me teach you a way to play it differently.\" He replaced the game's phrase with \"무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다!\" (\"The rose of Sharon has bloomed!\"). This game and song allowed Korean children to express their patriotism through play, reflecting the spirit of independence during that era. When the drama \"Squid Game\" gained worldwide popularity, Japan claimed it as their own game. However, \"무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다!\" (\"Mugunghwa has bloomed!\") symbolizes the spirit of independence of Koreans who resisted Japanese colonial rule.姜大德.

While he was a student at Seisoku school, on the evening of April 16, 1920, while passing through downtown Tokyo, Kim was deeply moved by a street sermon given by Matsuda, a student at the time at the Oriental Missionary Society Bible Institute. As a result, he started attending the Holiness Church from April 18 (Sunday) and purchased the New Testament for the first time, thus embracing the Christian faith. In the early stages of his faith journey, he considered Christian teachings, especially in terms of ethics, to be much deeper and nobler than Confucianism. On June 27, 1920, he received baptism from Pastor Shimizu at the Holiness Church. During his time in Tokyo, he learned the Bible and was deeply influenced by the Christian thinkers Uchimura Kanzo (内村鑑三), who opposed Japan's militarism and advocated for a Bible-centered non-denominational Christianity, and Yanaihara Tadao (柳原堂太郎). Kim switched his major from English literature to geography, while simultaneously pursuing theology.  \n\nContribution:  Kim was a religious leader, philosopher, publisher, educator, and independence activist who propagated Koreanized Christianity. He was a teacher and educator who aimed to transform young students, who had lost hope in Korea, into honest and diligent citizens to prepare for the country's future. After graduating, he took on the role of a teacher, consistent with his background in teacher education.\n\nHis journey in education began when he took a teaching position at Hamheung Yeongsang Girls' High School upon his return to Korea in April 1927. However, his tenure as a teacher there lasted only about a year. Nonetheless, this period is significant because it was during this time, in July, that the magazine \"Seongseo Joseon\" (성서조선), a critical part of his life, was founded. Kim’s life was intrinsically linked with \"Seongseo Joseon.\" As a teacher, his primary goal was to use education as a means to establish \"Joseon\" (Korea) upon the foundation of the Bible and Korean spirit.\n\n\nAnother crucial phase of his life was spent at Yangjeongbo Tong High School (now Yangjeong High School). He was there from the early 1920s until 1940, turning 40 years old. His ultimate purpose in life was to establish \"Joseon\" (Korea) upon the Bible with a fervent love for his nation. Although his profession as a teacher was secondary, the school environment provided the necessary support for the publication of \"Seongseo Joseon,\" the nurturing of countless disciples through its teachings, and the embodiment of his beliefs and spirit by his students.\n\nDuring his time at Yangjeong High School, Kim was involved in various activities related to \"Seongseo Joseon.\" He assisted Jung Sanghun, the editor-in-chief, with the publication of \"Seongseo Joseon\" starting in 1928. From 1930 onwards, he took on the role of chief editor and publisher of \"Seongseo Joseon.\" He organized Bible study groups, various gatherings, and conducted in-depth Bible research. In 1933, he published a study on the Sermon on the Mount, and he also served the sick on Sorok Island. In 1939, he mentored his disciple, Ryu Dallyeong, in creating and publishing \"Choi, Yongshin\" (최용신), which featured the character from the novel \"Sangnoksu\" by Shim Hoon. \n\nIn March 1940, he resigned from Yangjeong Tong High School to dedicate himself to gospel evangelism. In April of that year, he published \"Uchimura Kanzo and Joseon\" (內村鑑三과 朝鮮) in collaboration with Ham Seokheon. However, at the request of his senior and former classmate, the then-principal, Iwamura, he began teaching at Jeil High School (currently Kyunggi High School) in September of the same year. His time as a teacher in Kyunggi was relatively short-lived, as he was eventually expelled after gaining attention as a questionable figure. In October 1941, he returned to Songdo High School at the recommendation of a relative.\n\nIn March 1942, the \"Choe-wa\" incident, initiated by an article he wrote, led to the closure of \"Seongseo Joseon,\" and Kim was arrested, marking the end of his 15-year teaching career. His educational journey spanned various institutions, but it can be summarized as a true mission to lay the foundation for the Korean spirit through the development of a genuine national identity, avoiding the politically charged nationalist education of the time.\n\nKoreanized Christianity was at the core of Kim’s efforts to transform Koreans into Bible-based people who could renew Korea. He placed great importance on Korean culture, morals, and the Korean spirit, believing these were the foundations of a new Korea. He emphasized the significance of Hangul and considered history's essence to be rooted in faith. Although he pursued a Christian-based Korea, he was well aware of the limitations of traditional Korean culture, ethics, and customs. He believed that many aspects of these were impure and needed to be reformed and renewed.\n\nKim firmly believed that Christianity was not just a business or movement; it was faith itself. He acknowledged that traditional Korean culture, ethics, and customs contained some value but were primarily tainted and dominated by impurities. Therefore, he advocated for the purification of these elements and the creation of a new order. He believed that Christ's purifying fire could transform all things of the flesh into eternal, spiritual entities. Kim maintained that through faith in the Bible and Christianity, Korea could be reborn. He also had an unwavering belief in the eternal nature of \"Seongseo Joseon,\" despite the transient nature of other ideologies such as Science Korea, Agricultural Korea, Industrial Korea, and Communist Korea.\n\nKim’s strong faith-centered approach in his life and work aligned with the cultural movement theory of the 1920s and 1930s. Despite some indirect criticism of the overall authoritarian nature of Japan during the publication of \"Seongseo Joseon,\" he was passive regarding political independence movements. Kim did participate in the March 1st Movement in 1919 during his time at Hamheung Public Agricultural School. However, according to records from the early 1940s, he did not support the organization of political societies by Christians.\n\nIn the 1920s, the term \"Korean Studies\" began to gain prominence, and there were active efforts to understand national history as cultural history. During that time, Kim’s  Korean Studies were of a non-political or anti-political nature. However, around 1930, there emerged a movement that pursued a different meaning of Korean Studies, which eventually developed into the Korean Studies Movement in 1934. Kim’s orientation aligns closely with the Korean Studies of the 1920s and, particularly, the Korean Studies Movement of the 1930s. His emphasis on Korean culture, the accumulation of the Korean spirit throughout history and culture, and the unique Korean sentiment through Hangul all indicate this alignment. Kim believed that the essence of history lay in faith. He believed that Korea could only be reborn through faith in the Bible. Furthermore, Christianity was not seen as a business or a movement but as faith itself. His faith-centered approach highlighted the limitations of the social and cultural movements within the Korean Christian community during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n전인수.

In 1933, he took on the responsibility of overseeing the funeral of Baek Seon-haeng, a Christian who supported educational initiatives, under Japanese surveillance. Even when Ahn Chang-ho passed away after enduring torture during the Su-yang-dong Uprising, Jo Man-sik served as the chairman of Ahn Chang-ho's funeral committee in Seoul amidst Japanese oppression. Additionally, he encouraged youth movements and became a member of the Ewha Women's College Support Committee in 1939. During this time, Japanese exploitation of Korea intensified, and Jo Man-sik promoted the Buy-Korea Campaign to encourage the movement of boycotting Japanese goods. Researchers interpret these actions as Jo Man-sik's efforts to realize Christian love and justice.\n\nIn the 1930s, Jo Man-sik summarized the difficulties in the lives of Koreans in three main aspects. Firstly, he mentioned that the overall hardship in people's lives was something experienced daily by the entire population. Secondly, he pointed out the prevalence of indebtedness, which extended not only to businessmen but also to farmers, with total debts reaching 400-500 million won. Thirdly, he noted the phenomenon of property impoverishment, where the area and quantity of land and houses were rapidly decreasing due to natural dispossession. He attributed these phenomena to unlimited monetary loans and the inadequate support for the general population. He believed that to overcome the hardships and debt growth caused by unlimited monetary loans, various policies centered around Koreans were needed. However, he also acknowledged that Japanese oppression and policies were among the root causes, making it nearly impossible to rely solely on such policies for the protection of Koreans. Therefore, he emphasized the need for guidance and development for farmers as a primary solution for the general population. He also proposed addressing the issues of the general population through Christian evangelism and the cultivation of leaders, which could lead to improvements in agriculture, promotion of supplementary occupations, organization of cooperatives, eradication of illiteracy, and the promotion of culture.\n\nFurthermore, he suggested the early development of manufacturing industries as a fourth solution. These movements aimed to lead the people towards enlightenment and livelihood improvement, which were part of the rural movement and the Korean product promotion movement. Jo Man-sik specifically called on Christian youth, saying, \"Can't you hear the cries of our people and the suffering of our compatriots due to hardships? Don't you see that our tasks are piled up like mountains?\" Efforts to transform the living conditions of compatriots suffering from hardships are efforts to preserve life and guarantee human dignity and worth. The social reform movement to ensure the pursuit of happiness, dignity, and value of individuals can be considered a core element of transformative justice. From the same perspective, the YMCA movement, the livelihood improvement movement, the activities of the Preparatory Committee for National Reconstruction after liberation, and the opposition to trustee rule are all understood as part of movements aimed at realizing transformative justice.\n\nIn June 1932, at the age of 50, Jo Man-sik assumed the position of Chairman of the \"Chosun Ilbo\" and began exploring the national movement through the press. He worked to improve the financially troubled Chosun Ilbo and emerged as a prominent figure in the domestic national movement in the Pyongyang region. At that time, within the national independence movement, there were two main factions: the Heungup-Gurakbu faction centered in Seoul and the Suyang-dong Uwuhoe faction representing the Gwanso region centered in Pyongyang. When Ahn Chang-ho, who was the representative of the Heungup-Gurakbu faction in Seoul during the 1930s, passed away, Jo Man-sik became a leader who united these two factions, and he conducted the national economic self-reliance movement and the cultivation of capabilities.\n\n김권정.

Until that time, he had only studied Chinese literature, and Western missionaries approached him with the intention of spreading Christianity. However, he became more interested in Buddhism and Confucianism. While reading a book in his study in 1905, he suddenly heard a loud voice, \"절벽(絶壁) 유위(唯危)면 혈벽입(血壁立)하라!\" (Stand on the bloodstained wall if the cliff is too dangerous). He looked around, thinking someone was speaking nearby, but no one was there. He interpreted this as a message to believe in Jesus and, in 1907, he embraced Jesus at the Yeongbyeon Methodist Church and received baptism. At the age of thirty-seven, he prayed and contemplated what he should do with his life. He decided to become a doctor to heal the body and soul, and in 1912, he went to Seoul to study medicine. \n\nContribution: He was a traditional Korean medicine doctor who refused to participate in ancestral worship rituals and died as a martyr in Pyongyang.\n\nAfter obtaining a medical license in three years, he returned and opened a hospital called \"Jejung Hospital\" after purchasing a building. He also established the region's first church, where he led worship and preached. At the time, the local town had no legislator, and the hospital was doing well, but he strived not only to heal people's bodies but also to save their souls. People trusted him, and the hospital thrived. However, one day, due to a mistake in prescribing medication, a young boy died. He could do nothing but pray, and strangely, the boy came back to life during his funeral three days after his death. He testified to this miracle at the church and, thanking God, continued to treat people and preach while attending Muiwon. In 1934, he opened the Red Cross Clinic in Gaechon-eup, Pyeonganam-do, and became the first elder of the Gaechon Church.\n\nAround 1935, Park Gwan-jun had another vision. While praying in front of the pulpit at the church, he saw a figure dressed in white. The figure spoke, saying, \"From now on, I will select the elite soldiers of Christ. Who among you is willing to shed blood for me?\" Park immediately replied, \"I will shed my blood.\" As he looked closer, he saw a scroll in the figure's hand with the names of 40-50 individuals written on it, and at the very top, it clearly said 'Park Gwan-jun.'\n\nAfter this vision, he learned through a newspaper that three schools in Pyongyang (Sungsil Technical School, Sungsil Middle School, and Sungsil Girls' High School) were in danger of closing due to the issue of student participation in ancestral worship rituals. With determination, he visited the Pyongyang provincial office to meet with the Japanese education director and strongly criticized the unfairness of ancestral worship rituals. The Presbyterian Church in America decided to stand firm against the rituals even if it meant the closure of the schools. Park Gwan-jun also sent a petition to the Korean General Government, warning of Japan's impending downfall and urging the withdrawal of ancestral worship, which he considered idolatry that the church should not engage in.\n\nAround that time, news reached Pyongyang Theological Seminary that the Presbyterian Assembly of Pyeongbuk had resolved to participate in ancestral worship. The theological students were outraged. The only remaining hope was the General Assembly, and on September 10, 1938, the Japanese police deployed numerous officers with swords at the convention, intimidating and pressuring the ministers and elders to approve ancestral worship. Park Gwan-jun, along with Pastor Joo Ki-cheol and other believers, was involved in protests and struggles. However, the Japanese authorities had already imprisoned the dissenters in advance\n\nThe night before the General Assembly, while praying in jail, Park Gwan-jun had another vision. He saw a table set with the Lord's Supper, but suddenly, it overturned, and the white rice spilled out, turning into dirt. He had a premonition that the General Assembly would fail, and he felt great distress.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Park Gwan-jun met Ahn Yi-suk, who had left her teaching position at Seoncheon Girls' School due to her refusal to participate in ancestral worship. Together, they planned to go to Japan and inform Japanese Christian leaders of the injustice of ancestral worship and seek help for the Korean church. They left for Japan and, on March 24, 1939, during a meeting of the Imperial Diet (Chōteikai) where a religious bill was being discussed, Park Gwan-jun stood up suddenly and shouted, \"This is the message from the Lord God!\" as he threw a large envelope containing a warning against Japan towards the lower chamber of the meeting. There was chaos in the assembly, and they were arrested and imprisoned. After spending about 40 days in jail in Japan, under surveillance, the three of them returned to Korea. Park Gwan-jun was arrested once again, subjected to various forms of torture, and spent six years in prison. After his release, he fasted and prayed but eventually passed away. His last words were, \"Do not participate in ancestral worship. Believe in Jesus wholeheartedly. Our country will become as described in Isaiah 11:10-16. Hold onto your faith until the end, and let's meet in the glorious kingdom of heaven.\"\n\nhttps://www.fgnews.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=29785\n\nhttps://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B0%95%EA%B4%80%EC%A4%80\n\nhttps://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0020547\n\n\nLee, Hyo-deok 이효덕 李孝德\n\nBirth/Death: 1895/01/24 (Pyongannam-do, Yonggang) ~ 1978/09/15 (Seoul)\n\nEducation: Born into a wealthy yangban (noble) family, she and her entire family converted to Christianity when she was just 5 years old. Thanks to her parents' strong emphasis on education, despite being the daughter of a yangban family, she attended missionary-founded schools like Jungjin Elementary School and Sungeui Girls' Middle School. After graduating from middle school in 1911, she became involved in missionary work and, while actively participating, taught subjects such as science and Korean history at Sungeui Girls' Middle School where she attended.\n\nContribution. The reevaluation of Lee Hyo-deok in the 1930s is due to her dedication to the temperance movement, women's education, and the promotion of Buy-Korea campaign. She took on the role of secretary-general of the Christian Temperance Union of Korea in 1929. She traveled across the country giving lectures, drawing crowds of thousands. In 1929, when leaders of the women's nationalistic organization, Geunwoo-hoe, were arrested by Japanese police, Son Me-rye, who was also a member of Geunwoo-hoe and held the position of secretary-general of the Temperance Union, had to step down. Consequently, Lee Hyo-deok, who was teaching at Gijeon Girls' School in Jeonju, was suddenly appointed as the secretary-general of the Temperance Union. She earned her leadership through her activities in organizations like Taehwa Women's Association and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA).\n\nLee Hyo-deok organized the Temperance Union in various regions and emphasized its importance to the extent that she said, \"A church that does not organize the Temperance Union cannot be considered a church at all.\" As a result, the Temperance Union, which initially had 6 local chapters with 1,508 members at the time of its founding, expanded to 53 local chapters with 3,217 members in 1928 and further to 116 local chapters in 1934. Lee Hyo-deok also actively campaigned for the abolition of prostitution, advocating for the liberation of women engaged in prostitution. In the 1930s, the Christian temperance movement evolved from a movement limited to believers into a nationwide movement involving all people. As urbanization rapidly progressed in the 1930s, it led to the rapid spread of a degenerate culture and the expansion of prostitution to rural areas. Lee Hyo-deok's campaign to abolish prostitution went beyond a simple campaign for abolition; it was a women's enlightenment movement aimed at encouraging women to protect their own virtue.\n\nStarting in 1933, she believed that education on temperance from an early age was necessary, so she organized \"Children's Temperance Clubs\" and \"Youth and Girl Temperance Clubs\" to instill the importance of temperance in young people. In her New Year's plan announced in the newspaper on January 1, 1934, Lee Hyo-deok outlined her activities:\n\nTo inform Korean women and girls about the dangers of abortion.\n\nTo continue the campaign for total abstinence.\n\nTo promote agriculture and improve productivity.\n\nTo recruit members for the Temperance Union, regardless of gender or nationality, as long as they support the union's objectives.\n\nTo continue the Youth Temperance Club and actively implement temperance education for young people.\n\nTo encourage parents to become those who want to raise their children to complete their military service.\n\nTo conduct at least twelve temperance propaganda processions a year to stimulate public opinion.\n\nDespite the Japanese oppression, Lee Hyo-deok continued her lecture tours until her last lecture on April 15, 1936, in Yeomul-ssi, Ongjin, Hwanghae Province. Due to health reasons and a six-month lecture suspension, she was unable to continue her lectures, eventually resigning from her position as secretary-general of the Temperance Union in 1937.\n\n황미숙.

Her paternal grandfather was an education activist who established a school through the proceeds from selling mulberry trees, and her father was also involved in education. Growing up in an affluent environment in a modernized household, Choi Yong-shin started attending Sunday school at a young age, which led her to embrace the Christian faith. While attending a private school in her hometown, she transferred to Won-san's Lucy Girls' Ordinary School, which was operated by American Methodist women missionaries in 1918. After graduating from the ordinary school, she enrolled in Lucy Girls' High Ordinary School. It appears that during her time at the girls' school, Choi Yong-shin began to take an interest in social activities and rural issues. In her writings during her time at the girls' school, one can find a passage that reads, \"Should we, who have received secondary education, only yearn for a splendid urban life and dream of a comfortable life? Should we return to the countryside and strive for the eradication of illiteracy? I say again, let us join hands and run to the rural areas.\" In 1928, Choi Yong-shin graduated as the top student from Lucy Girls' High Ordinary School and enrolled at Hapchung Women's Theological School. It was there that she met Professor Hwang Ae-deok. Hwang Ae-deok, during her time as a teacher at Pyongyang's Sungui Girls' School, led the anti-Japanese secret society called Songjukhoe (Pine Bamboo Society) and was a nationalist activist who served two years in prison for her involvement in the Korean Patriotic Women's Association incident. At the time, Ana Chaffin, a missionary who was interested in the rural realities of Korea and served as the head of Hapchung Women's Theological School, established the \"Rural Work Leadership Education Course\" to train rural leaders, and she entrusted this responsibility to Hwang Ae-deok upon her return from studying in the United States.\n\nContribution: She lived a short life of 25 years, but she was an educator and dedicated herself to the rural enlightenment movement. Without completing her theological studies, Choi Yong-shin entered Samgol (now Bonodong, Sangnok-gu, Ansan-si) in Banwol-myeon, Hwaseong-gun, Gyeonggi Province, with the support of the YWCA on October 10, 1931. The moment she arrived in Samgol (Cheongok), Yong-shin prayed, \"Please consume my body and soul entirely to enlighten this village.\" She began gathering children and teaching them at Cheongok Training Center, an annex to Cheongok Church. Initially, she faced difficulties due to misunderstandings and opposition from the residents, but through her dedicated efforts, the training center received official recognition in May 1932. The number of students gradually increased, and they operated morning and afternoon sessions. In the evenings, she gathered local women to teach them subjects like the Korean alphabet, arithmetic, sewing, and needlework. While looking for a new building for the training center, Yong-shin organized the \"Hangeawi Feast\" during the Chuseok (Korean harvest festival) holiday. On the evening of Chuseok, the children showcased their talents in singing, dancing, and acting in the Cheongok Church courtyard, leaving the residents impressed and delighted with their children's talents. At this gathering, Yong-shin emphasized the need for a new building, and the residents spontaneously organized the \"Cheongok Academy Building Fundraising Committee.\" Construction began just five days after the committee was organized. They secured a site in the pine forest behind Samgol, donated by the village head. With unanimous support from the entire village, they were able to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for Cheongok Academy in January 1933, only four months after construction began. Samgol underwent a transformation in a vibrant atmosphere. To encourage improved living conditions and rural supplementary income, women's groups and youth groups were organized, and mutual trust led to increased communal production, laying the foundation for a cooperative economy. While the movement in Samgol was successfully taking root, Yong-shin felt a sense of urgency, believing that \"if we want to make this place a catalyst for the rural movement, we need new knowledge and ideas.\" She decided to study abroad in Japan. However, after just six months, she fell ill with various illnesses. At this time, she intended to recuperate in her hometown, but due to the earnest pleas of the Samgol residents, who said, \"You don't have to do anything; just stay by our side,\" she returned to Samgol. Her health somewhat recovered, and she was about to start a new project when the YWCA's support was suddenly cut off completely. She sought help from various sources, but the responses were cold. At the age of 25 in 1935, she passed away.
