The increase in non-religious students in Christian schools led to a surge in associate members among non-religious students in the student YMCA. This shift in membership led to some neglect of the youth group's values and responsibilities. Additionally, the disruptive behavior of students began to emerge as a social issue, while socialist movements against religion resurged, causing further ideological confusion.\n\nTo counteract the anti-religious movement, there was a demand to reconcile faith with science, rationalize faith, and revive sacrificial religious spirit, while also resisting the prevailing pleasure-seeking culture. In March 1929, during the Korea Student Christian Youth Association Presidents' Conference held in Seongbuk-dong, Seoul, resolutions were made to intensify the sense of devotion among members. These resolutions aimed to unify the mind and ideology, promote abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, encourage self-control regarding pleasure, foster a proper understanding of Christianity, and strengthen faith. This was in response to the challenges posed by these issues.\n\nAdditionally, efforts were made to establish an organization called the \"Inner Circle\" to provide internal guidance for student youth groups. An example of such a group was the \"Student Youth Friendship League,\" founded in Seoul in 1928 under the slogan \"Carry the Cross.\" It consisted of around 20 Christian students from specialized schools in the city. This league, led by Choi Bong-chik, a member of the YMCA student movement and a member of the Su-yang Club, appeared to join the newly formed Christian Cooperative Front when it was established. The Christian Cooperative Front advocated for the popularization and realization of \"Christianity\" in contrast to Marxism. Subsequently, \"Christianity\" became a new theme in the student Christian movement, as seen earlier in the case of the Christian Rural Research Association.\n\nThe question of the identity of the YMCA student movement was also a central issue during the 4th Korea Student Christian Youth Association Joint Presidents' Conference, held from August 21 to 27, 1930, at Naegumgang Jangansa. The conference featured discussions on various topics, including spirituality, ideology, economic movements, and the study and discussion of contemporary social issues. Notably, discussions on \"socialism\" and the \"rational problem\" emerged as major topics of debate, revealing the core of the controversy surrounding the identity of the student youth movement.\n\nMoreover, during the 4th Joint Presidents' Conference, the official establishment of the Korea Student Christian Youth Association Federation as the joint organization of student YMCA and YWCA was announced. The federation functioned as a representative organization for the student movement, electing ten members, five from each gender, as its executive committee to oversee activities such as the Presidential Assembly, Joint Presidents' Conference, World Prayer Day, and external affairs. In 1931, from August 22 to 28, the 5th Joint Presidents' Conference, held in Sambongsan Doseonsa, saw the participation of representatives from 23 schools, with over 50 male and female students. Topics discussed included faith issues, social science issues, gender issues, rural work, and youth organization activities.\n\nHowever, as the Manchurian Incident unfolded in September 1931, the student federation's joint activities faced unexpected challenges due to the restrictions imposed by the Japanese authorities. This led to difficulties not only in social action but also in holding joint conferences. In 1932, the federation took a year off from its activities, and in August 1933, the 6th Joint Presidents' Conference was held at Uijeongbu Hoeryongsa, but it turned out to be the last conference of its kind. Amid the changing internal and external circumstances and internal conflicts within the Christian community, the student federation's activities waned significantly.\n\nBy 1935, key figures like Lee Dae-wi, who had been in charge of the federation's student work, had shifted their positions within the church, and the student YMCA movement was further weakened when Shin Hyung-woo, who had played a role as the interim representative of Lee Seung-man, resigned from his position as YMCA secretary due to the Active Faith Movement in 1935. Against this backdrop, the Korea YMCA Federation was absorbed into the Japanese YMCA in 1938, effectively ending its activities.\n\nIn the meantime, the student YMCA-YWCA, which had maintained its lineage by school, was integrated into the National Federation of Youth Organizations organized by schools in 1941, leading to its disappearance.\n\n\n장규식.

The efforts of the Korean Women's Temperance Society and churches played a central role in these developments.\n\n\nDuring the height of the temperance movement, there were notable reductions or stabilizations in the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, opium, and participation in prostitution-related activities. The consumption of alcohol was closely related to alcohol taxes. When the temperance movement gained momentum, especially during the period when the Women's Temperance Society was active alongside Tinning's arrival in 1923 to promote the movement, alcohol consumption decreased by about 20%. Alcohol tax revenue increased from 3,689.2 million yen in 1921 to 4,252.5 million yen in 1922, but it decreased to 3,439.3 million yen in 1923. Furthermore, in the early 1930s, around the time when the Temperance Movement Association was formed, there was another three-year period of decline. The tobacco tax, which included the sales tax in 1921, amounted to 8.22 million yen. It decreased to 6.995 million yen in 1922 and further dropped to 6.509 million yen in 1923. The tobacco tax, which was 23.871 million yen in 1931, decreased to 17.893 million yen in 1932, 19.98 million yen in 1933, and 18.851 million yen in 1934.\n\n\nIn 1919, during the March 1st Movement, the issue of opium was strongly raised. As a result, there were significant differences between 1919 and the 1920s. In 1919, the area under opium cultivation was drastically reduced from 2,308.2 acres to 94.7 acres in 1920. Similarly, production decreased from 2,022.94 kg in 1919 to 41.56 kg in 1920. Although it increased again from 1921, it did not reach the levels of 1919. This decrease is believed to be a result of the anti-opium movement during the March 1st Movement. Japanese opium production peaked in 1919 and then showed a sharp decline. In 1920, there were 72,762 Korean hostesses and hostess businesses and 6,974 Japanese in the industry. However, in 1925, the number of Koreans decreased to 62,151, while the number of Japanese remained at 7,050. Koreans decreased by about ten thousand. Furthermore, in 1930, the number of Koreans decreased to 55,187, while the number of Japanese increased to 7,473. Even in 1935, Koreans decreased to 50,604, but Japanese increased to 9,880. This decrease coincided with the active nationwide temperance movement led by the YWCA, Temperance Movement Association, and Women's Temperance Society. What is interesting is that, while the number of Korean hostesses and hostess businesses continued to decrease, the number of Japanese in the industry continued to increase.\n\n\nVarious interpretations can be made regarding the decrease in alcohol consumption, tobacco consumption, opium production, and involvement in prostitution-related activities. However, from the perspective of the Christian temperance movement, this decrease is seen as a result of the temperance movement's efforts. Consumption decreased in the years around 1923-24 and 1932, when the temperance movement was strong. Especially noteworthy is the gradual decrease in opium and involvement in prostitution-related activities starting around 1920, which is attributed to the influence of the Christian temperance movement.\n\n\nFurthermore, the enforcement of the Minor's Prohibition Act and Minor's Abstinence Act followed. In September 1929, the General Assembly of Elders, North Presbyterian Church, South Presbyterian Church, and the Korean Sunday School organized the \"Alliance for the Implementation of the Minor's Prohibition of Alcohol and Smoking Act.\" This alliance was based at the central church in Keijo (Seoul) and aimed to promote the campaign for the physical and spiritual health of the second generation as follows:\n\n\nTo thoroughly consider the physical and spiritual health of the second generation.\n\nTo rationalize the temperance movement.\n\nTo avoid entering places of violation, even if there are suspicions of violations during gatherings of students, and to take appropriate measures afterward.\n\nTo carry out confiscations only in cases of clear violations.\n\nSeparately, in June 1931, during the 1st Eastern, Central, and Western Conferences of the Korean Presbyterian Church on the temperance issue, the Temperance Department passed several resolutions regarding youth. The Temperance Department decided not to employ teachers who were in charge of the primary education department in church-affiliated schools. They also decided to include content related to abstinence from alcohol and tobacco in the Bible curriculum, divided into several sessions. Additionally, they resolved to strictly enforce abstinence campaigns among students.\n\n\nThe Japanese authorities were hesitant about enforcing the Minor's Abstinence Act due to political considerations. However, the Christian temperance movement consistently urged the implementation of this law, even on an internal self-reliance basis. The Japanese had already enacted the Minor's Smoking Prohibition Act and the Minor's Abstinence Act in their own country in 1899 and 1922, respectively. Furthermore, under the influence of the temperance movement, there was a growing atmosphere to raise the age of minors to 25 years old. On the other hand, in Korea, these issues were largely ignored.\n\n\nIn the end, in March 1938, Japan announced the \"Minor's Abstinence from Smoking Act\" and \"Minor's Abstinence from Drinking Act.\" The enforcement orders for these laws were also issued. These laws and their implementation can be seen as another result of the temperance movement. While laws like the \"Abstinence Act,\" \"Opium Cultivation Prohibition,\" and \"Prostitution Abolition\" were not passed, these measures were the best alternative at the time.\n\n윤은순.

The organization that facilitated the cohesion of these students during this period was the Korean Student Association.\n\n\nThe Korean Student Association operated under the support of the Overseas Student Relations Committee of the North American YMCA and published the English monthly magazine \"The Korean Student Bulletin\" from December 1922 to April 1940. It was the largest student organization formed across various regions and schools, playing a significant role in leading the Korean student community. The Korean Student Association was also involved in various international student conferences, such as the 1932 International Student Aid Conference in Buffalo and the 1935 Oriental Student Conference in Chicago, where they sent Korean representatives to promote awareness of Korean issues.\n\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, many of the leaders of the Korean Student Association were Christians. Upon returning to Korea, they played leadership roles in various fields such as economics and education, contributing to the development of both Christian and nationalist movements. They formed networks in the United States, mainly in the Eastern and Midwestern regions, often with a foundation in church sponsorship. The Korean Student Association was active in publishing, including \"The Korean Student Bulletin\" and the Korean-language magazine \"우라키 (The Rocky).\" These publications aimed to introduce Korean students to Christianity and promote their interest in Christian ethics and education. They also served to raise awareness among American Christians about Korea.\n\n\nIn their publications, they covered a wide range of topics, including religion, philosophy, education, social sciences, natural sciences, economics, literature, and news from both Korea and the United States. Additionally, they shared their experiences of studying abroad and indirectly advocated for studying in the United States.\n\n\nThe Korean Student Association also discussed the relationship between the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Provisional Government in the meetings. They adopted resolutions related to recognizing the Provisional Government in Shanghai as the highest authority of the independence movement, population tax contributions, purchasing arms, and acknowledging the Korean Provisional Government's authority. In 1925, they even passed a resolution supporting the disbandment of the Korean Provisional Government, reflecting the division among Korean students in the United States.\n\n\nDuring the 1930s, they discussed various issues related to the Provisional Government in Shanghai, the Korean Provisional Government, and the independence movement, and passed resolutions in support of these organizations. The Korean Student Association was committed to the Korean independence movement and played a significant role in raising awareness and support among Korean students studying in the United States.\n\n\nIn summary, during the 1920s and 1930s, the Korean Student Association, composed of Korean students studying in the United States, actively engaged in various activities such as publishing magazines, attending international conferences, and discussing important issues related to the Korean independence movement and the relationship between the Provisional Government and the Korean Provisional Government. They played a crucial role in raising awareness of Korean issues and promoting unity among Korean students abroad.\n\n張圭植. (2006). 일제하 미국유학생의 서구 근대체험과 미국문명 인식. 한국사연구, (133), 141-173.\n\n張圭植.

To be precise, it should be noted as the 50th anniversary of Korean missions for the United Presbyterian Church in North America and the Board of Missions for the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States.\n\n\nSince Kimla Church was a result of the union between the Southern and Northern Methodist Churches in 1930, arranging the commemorative events was made more manageable. Their commemorative efforts included both spiritual and material initiatives, as well as historical documentation. Spiritually, they planned for revival meetings, the publication of the Daedunhoe magazine, and lecture series. Materially, they aimed to raise 200,000 won as the church's basic fund by 1938. Additionally, they compiled historical records in Korean and English, publishing papers and pamphlets to enhance missionary achievements. They also organized Jubilee commemorative events. As part of their commemorative efforts, they held events such as lectures and a play depicting the history of Methodist missionary work, starting with Jungdong Church in June 1934. On April 21, 1935, they conducted a 50th-anniversary worship service nationwide.\n\n\nThe Presbyterian Church and the United Presbyterian Church conducted separate commemorative activities. In June 1934, they held the '50th Anniversary Pastor's Conference' and engaged in extensive evangelism efforts. However, the Presbyterian Church's commemorative activities did not extend beyond 1935 due to issues such as the 'passport problem,' 'Genesis: Moses Authorship dispute,' 'Abingdon Bible Commentary issue,' 'New Hymnals issue,' and the 'Christian Century Magazine problem.' These theological conflicts between progressive and conservative factions within the Presbyterian Church, as well as disputes between the Northwestern and non-Northwestern denominations, created ecclesiastical disagreements.\n\n이상윤.
