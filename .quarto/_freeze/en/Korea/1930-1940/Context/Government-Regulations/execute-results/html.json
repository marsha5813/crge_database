These policies were grounded in Japanese imperial ideology and the imperialization (皇民化) framework aimed at war mobilization. Initially, Christian evangelism, school operations, and clergy appointments were strictly regulated through the 1915 Missionary Rules and the 1912 Police Offense Punishment Regulations, with even more coercive measures employed from the mid-1930s onward.\n\n\nTable 1.

The Japanese colonial authorities implemented the \"imperialization\" policy through the Government-General of Korea, expanding the enforcement of national ceremonies to Christian schools and churches as well. Shrine worship was regarded not merely as a religious ritual but as a loyalty ceremony to the state, and non-compliance resulted in school closures, clergy dismissals, and missionary expulsions.\n\nIn 1935, Christian schools including Soongsil School in Pyongyang refused the demand for forced worship at Pyongyang Shrine. These institutions declined to participate in shrine worship on grounds of religious conviction, with key principals such as McCune, Lee Hee-man, and Jeong Ik-seong taking the lead. The Government-General defined this as organized resistance and responded with harsh measures, marking the beginning of full-scale control and suppression of Christian schools.\n\nPastor Han Sang-dong publicly preached against shrine worship at Masan Moonchang Church in 1938, defining it as idolatry and resigning from his pastoral position. He led the non-participation movement in Gyeongnam and Busan Choryang Church, even resolving to split the presbytery and organize a new presbytery. This represented both a religious resistance by the Christian community against Japanese forced shrine worship and an event connected to political divisions within the church.\n\nIn 1939, Elder Park Gwan-jun and teacher An I-suk planned to travel to Tokyo from Pyongyang to submit a petition against shrine worship to the Japanese government. With help from Park Young-chang of a Japanese seminary, they contacted the Japanese Salvation Army commander but were refused. Upon returning home, both were arrested by police and prosecuted at Pyongyang District Court, with Park Gwan-jun dying in custody due to torture. This incident symbolized the Christian community's direct resistance to Japanese central authority, going beyond simple religious refusal.\n\nIn 1942, clergy members of the Suncheon Presbytery in South Jeolla Province appeared to comply with shrine worship on the surface but actually openly revealed the impropriety of participation in their sermons. The Japanese authorities arrested them under the Peace Preservation Law and charges of impiety, bringing them to trial. This case demonstrates how Japanese religious policy, particularly forced shrine worship, generated conflict and resistance within church circles.\n\nIn 1943, the Holiness Church was ordered to dissolve by the Japanese authorities. Clergy were arrested and church properties confiscated at Geumhwa Holiness Church in Gangwon Province and Gunwi Holiness Church in North Gyeongsang Province. The Japanese judged that the Holiness Church's eschatological doctrine conflicted with national polity ideology, dissolving the denomination to suppress Christianity's independent doctrine and faith.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the Japanese authorities sought to incorporate church circles into the wartime mobilization system by forcing patriotic donation campaigns and recitation of the Imperial Subjects' Oath. Some churches cooperated for survival and church maintenance, while others continued resistance through underground churches and home worship services. Japanese religious policy aimed to subordinate churches to nationalist ideology, and this dual response became the beginning of divisions and theological conflicts in the Korean church after liberation.\n\nIn 1938 and 1940, the Government-General of Korea promulgated 'Guidance Measures' and 'Guidance Policies' that forced the Christian community to conduct imperial subject education and loyalty sermons, even censoring hymns and sermon texts. Under the 1939 Foreigners Entry and Residence Control Regulations, numerous missionaries were forcibly expelled, and the 1941 Foreigners Control Ordinance introduced a permit system for remaining missionaries' activities while enabling arbitrary arrests. Consequently, Korean Christianity's international networks were severed, and domestic churches had to maintain their faith under police and administrative surveillance and control. This was an extension of religious policy aimed at strengthening Japan's wartime system and blocking Christianity's independent propagation.\n\n\nConversely, there were also cases where the Christian community cooperated with wartime mobilization under Japanese coercion. From 1941, the Japanese authorities promoted wartime mobilization policies such as patriotic donation campaigns (patriotic contribution movements) by mobilizing churches, and churches were compelled to participate to some extent despite internal conflicts. This dual aspect of cooperation and resistance led to divisions and identity debates within Korean Christianity after liberation, with some church leaders becoming embroiled in pro-Japanese controversies while martyrs commemorated as symbols of resistance came to occupy an important position in church history.\n\n ",
