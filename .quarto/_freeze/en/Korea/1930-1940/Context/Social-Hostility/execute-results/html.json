Simultaneously, Christian communities sustained efforts to maintain social integration and national autonomy.\n\nNon-governmental hostility emerged from a complex interweaving of religious, nationalist, and economic factors. In Pyongyang, the Pyongyang Christian Fellowship was established in 1938 under Oh Moon-hwan's leadership, which received Japanese governmental support to organize pro-Japanese forces within Christian circles and encouraged shrine worship, military support activities, and participation in state ceremonies. This generated resentment within Christian communities and socially isolated underground churches and resistance forces that opposed shrine worship.\n\nThe Presbyterian General Assembly's acceptance of shrine worship in 1938 marked the beginning of serious internal divisions. Some clergy and believers defined shrine worship as idolatry and organized underground churches or left their denominations. Conversely, those who followed the General Assembly's decision criticized resisters as \"order destroyers,\" while resisters branded collaborators as betrayers of faith, deepening mutual distrust and conflict. Meanwhile, Japan's religious policy reflected intentions to weaken Christian influence by promoting State Shinto and Buddhism. This led to movements in some rural areas where Buddhist and Confucian leaders collaborated with local authorities to restrict Christian evangelism and stigmatize Christianity as a foreign religion.\n\nNationalist hostility toward missionaries also spread. As relations between Japan and Western powers deteriorated following the Second Sino-Japanese War, missionaries faced accusations of being agents of foreign powers, with newspapers and local communities suspecting them of espionage or anti-Japanese activities. Some regions witnessed boycotts against Christian hospitals and schools, and even property damage incidents. After 1938, underground churches faced surveillance and persecution from both state authorities and local communities. When pro-Japanese figures or neighbors reported secret worship services or prayer meetings, police arrests followed, leading to isolation within families and communities. This situation demonstrates that Christianity functioned as a symbol of national resistance beyond merely being a religious community.\n\nHowever, even within this hostile environment, Christian communities continued efforts to preserve social integration and national autonomy. Christian schools in Pyongyang and nationwide pursued incorporation movements to ensure educational continuity and asset protection despite Japanese oppression and foreign missionary expulsions. Through this process, churches and schools functioned as community centers, establishing community foundations that combined faith and education. Christian hospitals and mission hospitals served as another center of social integration. Severance Medical School (now Yonsei University) and Maryknoll Mission Hospital provided medical services to diverse social strata including women and low-income groups, simultaneously spreading Christian faith and social solidarity.\n\nThe Korean Christian Federation attempted inter-denominational unity and strove to maintain external cooperation and ecclesiastical autonomy, but faced limitations due to Japanese control and doctrinal conflicts. Nevertheless, this organization played a symbolic role in maintaining internal cohesion and faith community identity. Additionally, churches provided women with unprecedented social roles, challenging traditional Confucian gender norms. Women served as deacons, teachers, and organizers, occupying leadership positions in local communities, while the Christian women's movement strengthened education, welfare, and solidarity through organizations like the Korean YWCA.\n\nThese experiences of tension and cooperation profoundly influenced the division and social role of Korean churches after liberation. Internal ecclesiastical divisions manifested as inter-denominational conflicts, while churches' educational and social service activities laid foundations for Korean democratization. This dual face of hostility and integration reveals the complex reality of how Christianity maintained identity and community despite colonial oppression and social conflict.\n\n ",
