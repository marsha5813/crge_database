The big issue was State Shinto - they made everyone participate in shrine worship as a way to show loyalty to the Emperor. Christian institutions saw this as idol worship and pushed back hard. The consequences were brutal: churches and schools got shut down, and pastors who refused ended up in prison. Over in Manchuria and China, Korean Christian exiles - especially those connected to the Provisional Government we set up in Shanghai in 1919 - worked with Chinese nationalists to fight for Korean independence. They used Christian networks to try to get international support. But when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, everything got much harder. The increased military presence and surveillance made it really tough to maintain those cross-border collaborations.\n\n\nRelationships with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\nThe United States was absolutely crucial in developing Korean Christianity. American missionaries - mostly Presbyterians and Methodists - established tons of educational and medical institutions like Yonsei University and Ewha Womans University. They really helped foster a sense of civil society and modernity among Koreans. By 1930, there were over 700 Christian schools operating in Korea, and many of them used Korean as a form of cultural resistance.\n\nBut as Japanese nationalism ramped up, they became increasingly suspicious of foreign influence. In 1940, Japan kicked out 219 American missionaries, completely cutting off the vital connections between Korean churches and international Christian communities. This didn't just disrupt religious activities - it also cut off the flow of resources and support that these Christian institutions desperately needed. Despite all these challenges, Korean Christian leaders in exile like Syngman Rhee and An Chang-ho kept working with Western churches to lobby for international support against Japanese rule. Their efforts were really important in keeping the Korean independence movement visible on the global stage.\n\n\nThe State of Patriotism and Nationalism\n\nChristianity in Korea became deeply intertwined with the nationalist movement. The March First Movement of 1919 - which was pivotal in our independence struggle - saw massive participation from Christian leaders and church members. This really set the stage for faith-based nationalism, where religious identity became inseparable from the fight for national sovereignty.\n\nIn the 1930s, refusing to participate in Shinto rites became a powerful act of defiance. Pastors like Ju Gi-cheol were imprisoned for rejecting shrine worship, really embodying how Christian communities resisted cultural assimilation. Newspapers like Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo also played crucial roles in promoting Korean identity, constantly facing censorship and suspension for their nationalist positions. The Presbyterian Church's 1938 decision to comply with shrine visits created serious internal divisions. Those who disagreed formed underground churches, framing their resistance as both theological and patriotic. These splits really highlighted the complex relationship between religious convictions and nationalist fervor.\n\nChristianity's dual role - as both a target of colonial repression and a vehicle for nationalism - really cemented its influence in post-1945 South Korea. The church's integration of democratic values and emphasis on education laid the foundation for modernization. Moreover, those wartime resistance stories became central to Korean identity, with Christianity at the heart of our nation's journey toward sovereignty and self-determination.\n\n\n ",
