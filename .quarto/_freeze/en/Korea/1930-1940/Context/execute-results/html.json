These policies were grounded in Japanese imperial ideology and the imperialization (皇民化) framework aimed at war mobilization. Initially, Christian evangelism, school operations, and clergy appointments were strictly regulated through the 1915 Missionary Rules and the 1912 Police Offense Punishment Regulations, with even more coercive measures employed from the mid-1930s onward.\n\n\nTable 1.

The Japanese colonial authorities implemented the \"imperialization\" policy through the Government-General of Korea, expanding the enforcement of national ceremonies to Christian schools and churches as well. Shrine worship was regarded not merely as a religious ritual but as a loyalty ceremony to the state, and non-compliance resulted in school closures, clergy dismissals, and missionary expulsions.\n\nIn 1935, Christian schools including Soongsil School in Pyongyang refused the demand for forced worship at Pyongyang Shrine. These institutions declined to participate in shrine worship on grounds of religious conviction, with key principals such as McCune, Lee Hee-man, and Jeong Ik-seong taking the lead. The Government-General defined this as organized resistance and responded with harsh measures, marking the beginning of full-scale control and suppression of Christian schools.\n\nPastor Han Sang-dong publicly preached against shrine worship at Masan Moonchang Church in 1938, defining it as idolatry and resigning from his pastoral position. He led the non-participation movement in Gyeongnam and Busan Choryang Church, even resolving to split the presbytery and organize a new presbytery. This represented both a religious resistance by the Christian community against Japanese forced shrine worship and an event connected to political divisions within the church.\n\nIn 1939, Elder Park Gwan-jun and teacher An I-suk planned to travel to Tokyo from Pyongyang to submit a petition against shrine worship to the Japanese government. With help from Park Young-chang of a Japanese seminary, they contacted the Japanese Salvation Army commander but were refused. Upon returning home, both were arrested by police and prosecuted at Pyongyang District Court, with Park Gwan-jun dying in custody due to torture. This incident symbolized the Christian community's direct resistance to Japanese central authority, going beyond simple religious refusal.\n\nIn 1942, clergy members of the Suncheon Presbytery in South Jeolla Province appeared to comply with shrine worship on the surface but actually openly revealed the impropriety of participation in their sermons. The Japanese authorities arrested them under the Peace Preservation Law and charges of impiety, bringing them to trial. This case demonstrates how Japanese religious policy, particularly forced shrine worship, generated conflict and resistance within church circles.\n\nIn 1943, the Holiness Church was ordered to dissolve by the Japanese authorities. Clergy were arrested and church properties confiscated at Geumhwa Holiness Church in Gangwon Province and Gunwi Holiness Church in North Gyeongsang Province. The Japanese judged that the Holiness Church's eschatological doctrine conflicted with national polity ideology, dissolving the denomination to suppress Christianity's independent doctrine and faith.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the Japanese authorities sought to incorporate church circles into the wartime mobilization system by forcing patriotic donation campaigns and recitation of the Imperial Subjects' Oath. Some churches cooperated for survival and church maintenance, while others continued resistance through underground churches and home worship services. Japanese religious policy aimed to subordinate churches to nationalist ideology, and this dual response became the beginning of divisions and theological conflicts in the Korean church after liberation.\n\nIn 1938 and 1940, the Government-General of Korea promulgated 'Guidance Measures' and 'Guidance Policies' that forced the Christian community to conduct imperial subject education and loyalty sermons, even censoring hymns and sermon texts. Under the 1939 Foreigners Entry and Residence Control Regulations, numerous missionaries were forcibly expelled, and the 1941 Foreigners Control Ordinance introduced a permit system for remaining missionaries' activities while enabling arbitrary arrests. Consequently, Korean Christianity's international networks were severed, and domestic churches had to maintain their faith under police and administrative surveillance and control. This was an extension of religious policy aimed at strengthening Japan's wartime system and blocking Christianity's independent propagation.\n\n\nConversely, there were also cases where the Christian community cooperated with wartime mobilization under Japanese coercion. From 1941, the Japanese authorities promoted wartime mobilization policies such as patriotic donation campaigns (patriotic contribution movements) by mobilizing churches, and churches were compelled to participate to some extent despite internal conflicts. This dual aspect of cooperation and resistance led to divisions and identity debates within Korean Christianity after liberation, with some church leaders becoming embroiled in pro-Japanese controversies while martyrs commemorated as symbols of resistance came to occupy an important position in church history. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Korean Christianity faced various forms of social hostility and internal conflicts amid escalating political and social tensions under Japanese colonial rule. Simultaneously, Christian communities sustained efforts to maintain social integration and national autonomy.\n\nNon-governmental hostility emerged from a complex interweaving of religious, nationalist, and economic factors. In Pyongyang, the Pyongyang Christian Fellowship was established in 1938 under Oh Moon-hwan's leadership, which received Japanese governmental support to organize pro-Japanese forces within Christian circles and encouraged shrine worship, military support activities, and participation in state ceremonies. This generated resentment within Christian communities and socially isolated underground churches and resistance forces that opposed shrine worship.\n\nThe Presbyterian General Assembly's acceptance of shrine worship in 1938 marked the beginning of serious internal divisions. Some clergy and believers defined shrine worship as idolatry and organized underground churches or left their denominations. Conversely, those who followed the General Assembly's decision criticized resisters as \"order destroyers,\" while resisters branded collaborators as betrayers of faith, deepening mutual distrust and conflict. Meanwhile, Japan's religious policy reflected intentions to weaken Christian influence by promoting State Shinto and Buddhism. This led to movements in some rural areas where Buddhist and Confucian leaders collaborated with local authorities to restrict Christian evangelism and stigmatize Christianity as a foreign religion.\n\nNationalist hostility toward missionaries also spread. As relations between Japan and Western powers deteriorated following the Second Sino-Japanese War, missionaries faced accusations of being agents of foreign powers, with newspapers and local communities suspecting them of espionage or anti-Japanese activities. Some regions witnessed boycotts against Christian hospitals and schools, and even property damage incidents. After 1938, underground churches faced surveillance and persecution from both state authorities and local communities. When pro-Japanese figures or neighbors reported secret worship services or prayer meetings, police arrests followed, leading to isolation within families and communities. This situation demonstrates that Christianity functioned as a symbol of national resistance beyond merely being a religious community.\n\nHowever, even within this hostile environment, Christian communities continued efforts to preserve social integration and national autonomy. Christian schools in Pyongyang and nationwide pursued incorporation movements to ensure educational continuity and asset protection despite Japanese oppression and foreign missionary expulsions. Through this process, churches and schools functioned as community centers, establishing community foundations that combined faith and education. Christian hospitals and mission hospitals served as another center of social integration. Severance Medical School (now Yonsei University) and Maryknoll Mission Hospital provided medical services to diverse social strata including women and low-income groups, simultaneously spreading Christian faith and social solidarity.\n\nThe Korean Christian Federation attempted inter-denominational unity and strove to maintain external cooperation and ecclesiastical autonomy, but faced limitations due to Japanese control and doctrinal conflicts. Nevertheless, this organization played a symbolic role in maintaining internal cohesion and faith community identity. Additionally, churches provided women with unprecedented social roles, challenging traditional Confucian gender norms. Women served as deacons, teachers, and organizers, occupying leadership positions in local communities, while the Christian women's movement strengthened education, welfare, and solidarity through organizations like the Korean YWCA.\n\nThese experiences of tension and cooperation profoundly influenced the division and social role of Korean churches after liberation. Internal ecclesiastical divisions manifested as inter-denominational conflicts, while churches' educational and social service activities laid foundations for Korean democratization. This dual face of hostility and integration reveals the complex reality of how Christianity maintained identity and community despite colonial oppression and social conflict. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nDiplomatic Relationships with Neighboring Asia-Pacific Countries Pertinent to Christianity\n\nJapan's colonization of Korea (1910-1945) was really about wiping out Korean identity and forcing us into the Japanese Empire. The big issue was State Shinto - they made everyone participate in shrine worship as a way to show loyalty to the Emperor. Christian institutions saw this as idol worship and pushed back hard. The consequences were brutal: churches and schools got shut down, and pastors who refused ended up in prison. Over in Manchuria and China, Korean Christian exiles - especially those connected to the Provisional Government we set up in Shanghai in 1919 - worked with Chinese nationalists to fight for Korean independence. They used Christian networks to try to get international support. But when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, everything got much harder. The increased military presence and surveillance made it really tough to maintain those cross-border collaborations.\n\n\nRelationships with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\nThe United States was absolutely crucial in developing Korean Christianity. American missionaries - mostly Presbyterians and Methodists - established tons of educational and medical institutions like Yonsei University and Ewha Womans University. They really helped foster a sense of civil society and modernity among Koreans. By 1930, there were over 700 Christian schools operating in Korea, and many of them used Korean as a form of cultural resistance.\n\nBut as Japanese nationalism ramped up, they became increasingly suspicious of foreign influence. In 1940, Japan kicked out 219 American missionaries, completely cutting off the vital connections between Korean churches and international Christian communities. This didn't just disrupt religious activities - it also cut off the flow of resources and support that these Christian institutions desperately needed. Despite all these challenges, Korean Christian leaders in exile like Syngman Rhee and An Chang-ho kept working with Western churches to lobby for international support against Japanese rule. Their efforts were really important in keeping the Korean independence movement visible on the global stage.\n\n\nThe State of Patriotism and Nationalism\n\nChristianity in Korea became deeply intertwined with the nationalist movement. The March First Movement of 1919 - which was pivotal in our independence struggle - saw massive participation from Christian leaders and church members. This really set the stage for faith-based nationalism, where religious identity became inseparable from the fight for national sovereignty.\n\nIn the 1930s, refusing to participate in Shinto rites became a powerful act of defiance. Pastors like Ju Gi-cheol were imprisoned for rejecting shrine worship, really embodying how Christian communities resisted cultural assimilation. Newspapers like Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo also played crucial roles in promoting Korean identity, constantly facing censorship and suspension for their nationalist positions. The Presbyterian Church's 1938 decision to comply with shrine visits created serious internal divisions. Those who disagreed formed underground churches, framing their resistance as both theological and patriotic. These splits really highlighted the complex relationship between religious convictions and nationalist fervor.\n\nChristianity's dual role - as both a target of colonial repression and a vehicle for nationalism - really cemented its influence in post-1945 South Korea. The church's integration of democratic values and emphasis on education laid the foundation for modernization. Moreover, those wartime resistance stories became central to Korean identity, with Christianity at the heart of our nation's journey toward sovereignty and self-determination. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nAn, Yu-rim.
