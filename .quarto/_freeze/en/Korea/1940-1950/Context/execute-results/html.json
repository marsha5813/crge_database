The Soviet Union accepted this plan, leading to the simultaneous occupation and governance of the North and South by the U.S. and Soviet forces upon liberation.\n\n\nFollowing Japan's formal surrender, General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, issued General Order No. 1 on September 2, 1945. This order directed Japanese forces stationed north of the 38th parallel to surrender to the Soviet Far Eastern Command, while those stationed south of the 38th parallel were to surrender to the U.S. Army Pacific Command. Subsequently, on September 7th, the proclamation of military government in the south of the 38th parallel, known as \"US Army Pacific Command Proclamation No. 1,\" was announced, and on September 8th, the U.S. 24th Infantry Division landed in Incheon to occupy South Korea.\n\n\nThe 24th Infantry Division, chosen as the occupying force in South Korea, had been established under the command of General John Reed Hodge on April 8, 1944, in Hawaii, and had gained significant combat experience in various battles. The U.S. government and military prioritized the rapid deployment of the occupying force to deter the Soviet Union's swift southward movement. Therefore, the 24th Infantry Division, which was stationed in Okinawa at the time and could reach Korea most quickly due to its proximity, was selected as the occupying force for South Korea. However, General Hodge, who was appointed as the U.S. Military Governor of South Korea, had no prior experience or knowledge related to Korea. He primarily perceived the U.S. military's objective in occupying South Korea as disarming the Japanese forces and turning South Korea into a bulwark against Soviet occupation, influenced by strong anti-Soviet sentiments from higher authorities.\n\n\nBased on these occupation objectives, General Hodge initially planned to utilize the existing colonial administration system. On September 9, 1945, he disarmed Japanese forces in Seoul and received their formal surrender. He intended to maintain the colonial administration system and retain Japanese colonial officials, including Governor Abe Nobuyuki. However, these measures sparked intense resistance from the Korean population. Consequently, on September 12th, Governor Abe was removed from his position, and Colonel Archibald Vincent Arnold was appointed as the Military Governor. Subsequently, key colonial officials were dismissed, and U.S. military officers were appointed in their place, leading to the establishment of the official U.S. Military Government. This newly established U.S. Military Government was responsible for civil administration within South Korea, primarily handling administrative and economic affairs in the occupied areas. Additionally, since the police were under the jurisdiction of the military government, its activities were closely intertwined with domestic politics.\n\n\nArticle 12 of the Provisional Constitution reads as follows:\n\n\n\"① All citizens shall have the freedom of faith and conscience. ② There shall be no state religion, and religion shall be separated from politics.\"\n\n\nThis provision initially appeared in the draft by Yu Jin-oh and went through some modifications during joint deliberations with the Administrative Research Council before being officially confirmed in the constitution. So, where did the wording of the religious clause adopted in Yu Jin-oh's draft originate? While it is clear that it was influenced by the U.S. Constitution, there is still no definitive source even in the constitutional drafting history that provides more direct textual origins.\n\n\nHowever, upon investigation, it was discovered that General Hodge's \"Proclamation on the Rights of the Korean People\" (April 5, 1948) played a direct role during the drafting of Yu Jin-oh's draft. The influence of the former Soviet constitution was also faintly present and contributed to the formation of the religious clause in Yu Jin-oh's draft. When comparing the English original text of the proclamation with Yu Jin-oh's draft, the following can be observed:\n\n\n<Proclamation> \"All religions are equal before the law, and there is freedom of religious practice not contrary to public order or morality. There is no state church, and the principle of separation of religion and state is established.\"\n\n<Yu Jin-oh's draft> \"All people shall have the freedom of faith and conscience, and there shall be no discrimination in social or legal status based on differences in faith. There shall be no state religion, and religion shall be separated from politics.\"\n\n\nAnalyzing the differences between these two, we can make some educated guesses about how the drafter of this provision understood religious freedom. Firstly, we can see that \"freedom of religious practice\" was changed to \"freedom of faith,\" indicating that Yu Jin-oh's understanding of religious freedom emphasized individual and internal aspects. The use of the term \"faith\" instead of \"religion,\" while having institutional implications, can be seen as continuing a tradition found in constitutional documents since the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, rather than being a unique feature of Yu Jin-oh's draft.\n\n\nNevertheless, it is clear that Yu Jin-oh, as the drafter, inherited and preserved an understanding of religious freedom that focused on individual and internal dimensions. However, it is important to note that Yu Jin-oh did not solely perceive the freedom of faith as an internal freedom. During the parliamentary review of the constitution, as a member of the Constitutional Basis Committee, he explained religious freedom as follows: \"When it comes to religious freedom in the constitution, it includes not only the freedom of faith in one's heart but also the freedom to worship or the freedom to propagate one's faith. How to regulate it when it is expressed externally is another dimension of the issue.\" This indicates that he recognized the need to address the question of how to regulate religious freedom when it is expressed externally, moving beyond purely internal freedom. Another expert, Kwon Seung-ryul, who submitted a second draft to the Constitutional Assembly, was even more serious in this regard, as he showed thinking in another dimension of the problem that religious freedom or freedom of conscience corresponds purely to mental freedom, and when it is expressed externally, how to regulate it is another dimension of the problem.\n\n\nOne of the differences is the addition of \"freedom of conscience 良心\" alongside \"faith 信仰.\" The influence of Article 124 of the former Soviet Constitution, which clearly states that the purpose of the religious clause is to guarantee freedom of conscience, is presumed. Both the former Soviet Constitution and Yu Jin-oh's draft acknowledged the non-specificity of religious freedom and perceived it in parallel with individual freedom of conscience. This also underscores their primary understanding of religious freedom in terms of individual and internal aspects.\n\n\nWhile freedom of conscience takes a central place in religious freedom, historically, religious freedom has encompassed more than just the freedom of religious conscience. In Western contexts, this includes guarantees of autonomy within religious groups and the external practice of religion, as seen from the era of the medieval two-kingdom theory. Therefore, the fact mentioned above can be considered one of the characteristics of Yu Jin-oh's draft – one that highlights the shift of religious equality issues among religions into issues of individual discrimination based on faith.\n\n\nAnother difference is the omission of the phrase \"not contrary to public order or morality\" in Yu Jin-oh's draft. This was sometimes interpreted as a basis for unlimited interpretations of freedom of faith. However, it is more likely that Yu Jin-oh's narrow understanding of freedom of faith stemmed from his perception that religious freedom primarily emphasized internal and pure religious acts. In other words, because the scope of religious freedom was mainly understood in internal terms, it left less room for limitations. Nevertheless, if there were ever a need to restrict religious freedom, he believed it could be done even without explicit provisions. This is evident from his writings in 1947, where he explained that the people's basic rights were not absolute and could be enjoyed and guaranteed only within the limits recognized by the law, as long as it did not lead to illegal actions or abuses of rights.\n\n\nYu Jin-oh's narrow view of religious freedom may have been influenced by the colonial era, but his intention appears to have been that the specific relationship between the state and religion should be determined by lower-level legislation and regulations, such as laws. In fact, when questioned about the rights of religious groups to acquire, own, and manage property, as well as operate educational and charitable institutions, Yu Jin-oh responded, \"This mainly concerns issues related to civil law on corporate bodies, such as foundations and religious organizations, and tax exemption issues related to these operations would be addressed in civil law, so the constitution does not handle it.\" As seen here, what Yu Jin-oh envisioned was the assurance of the minimum religious freedom.\n\n\nFreedom of Faith, Prohibition of State Religion, and Separation of Religion: Proposed Amendments\n\n\nThe discussions on the religious clause were mainly led by Christian lawmakers, and the proposed amendments can be summarized into three main points. First, there was a proposal (by Lee Nam-gyu) to explicitly state in the first clause that freedom of faith is guaranteed within the bounds of the law and public order. Second, there was a proposal (by Kang Wook-jung) to delete the religious prohibition and separation clause found in the original Article 12, Paragraph 2. Third, there was a proposal (by Lee Nam-gyu and Won Yong-han) to insert a provision guaranteeing or promoting the freedom of religious practices in place of the deleted clause. When examining the proposed amendments and their explanations, it is reasonable to assume that the second and third contents were proposed with the same intention.\n\n\nSupporters of the amendments saw the separation of religion clause as hostile and even viewed it as an antagonistic separation of religion. Therefore, they wanted to delete it and insert language that clearly promoted friendly separation of religion. On the other hand, opponents of the amendments perceived the arguments of the proponents as advocating the establishment of a state religion, particularly favoring Christianity. As a result, they opposed the deletion of the separation of religion clause. However, even without officially recognizing a state religion, it is possible to establish a friendly relationship between the state and religion. Nevertheless, due to misunderstandings between the two sides, a clear consensus on this matter was not reached.\n\n\nThe voting results showed that Lee Nam-gyu's proposed amendment received the most support, with 169 members present, 37 in favor, and 82 opposed, but it remained unresolved. However, in the final vote on the original proposal, with 169 members present, 115 were in favor, and 65 were opposed, resulting in the adoption of the original proposal. It is difficult to determine the intentions of the lawmakers who opposed the amendments and supported the original proposal. It should be noted that during the constitutional review process, lawmakers generally tended to support the original proposal when they were unsure about specific issues. Furthermore, when speculating based on the opposition debates, in many cases, the main reason for opposing the amendments appears to have been the belief that the state should not recognize the establishment of a state religion. Concerns about whether Christianity, as the dominant religion, might suppress other religions if it were recognized as the state religion likely had a significant impact on the voting outcome.\n\nIn fact, there was once a controversy over this issue during the deliberations of the Constitutional Preparatory Committee. When the Constitution bill was being deliberated in the Constitutional Preparatory Committee, there was a dispute when Representative Lee Yoon-young proposed deleting the clause prohibiting state religion and the separation of religion, and in reality, the debate in the plenary session can be seen as a continuation of this dispute. An interesting point is that at that time, newspaper reports described the controversy as a \"issue of whether there should be a state religion.\" Despite the fact that the newspaper reports at the time were not entirely accurate, the fact that the controversy was framed as a debate over the presence of a state religion can be seen as reflecting the prevailing views within the Constituent Assembly at the time.\n\n\nTherefore, based on the premise that the original intent of the Constitution was unclear, if we were to follow the prevailing sentiment in the Constituent Assembly, there is ample room to believe that the majority of Constituent Assembly members naturally assumed that the state and religion could have a friendly relationship as long as there was no religious bias. As seen during the singing of the national anthem, which widely used the word 'God,' the singing of the national anthem proceeded without any objections on the first day of the Constituent Assembly, following the order of precedence. There was also a notable incident on that day related to the separation of religion and state. Representative Lee Yoon-young, a pastor of the Methodist Church, led the opening prayer according to President Lee Seung-man's summons, offering a prayer of thanksgiving for the opening of the session. However, a few days later, some Constituent Assembly members expressed discomfort with this incident during the deliberations on the Constitution bill. Perhaps it was due to discomfort with treating Christianity as if it were the state religion. Interestingly, the focus of this criticism was not on the act of conducting a religious ritual itself but on the object of that religious ritual. Representative Lee Jae-hyung, when asked by a journalist how the Constituent Assembly members, most of whom were not Christians, received the event, responded as follows: \"We did not perceive the prayer itself as a Christian ritual. We simply accepted it as an invocation for the founding of the liberated Republic of Korea.\" Clearly, the public prayer during the opening of the Constituent Assembly would have been perceived by Constituent Assembly members as an event straddling the boundaries between the models of state religion and friendly separation of religion. Although they may have felt uncomfortable deep down, they consciously chose to interpret and move past it, considering the object of that religious ritual to be a general deity. What is clear from this is that Constituent Assembly members did not have a significant problem with the concept of friendly separation of religion itself.\n\n\n이영록.

Today, the content of religious freedom is understood to encompass the freedom of faith, freedom of religious practices, and the freedom of religious assembly and association.\n\n\nThe use of the word 'religion' is quite unusual, and it is mainly 'faith' or 'religious faith' that has been used. Examples of using the word 'faith' include the Founding Declaration (1941), the Interim Constitution of the Republic of Korea (1944), the Democratic National Front Proposal (1946), the Interim Response to the United States (1947), the Response to the Democratic Front (1947), the Response to the Poetry Front (1947), Yu Jin-oh's Draft (1948), the Joint Draft of the Administrative Research Council and Yu Jin-oh (1948), and Kwon Seung-ryul's Draft (1948).\n\n\nExamples of using the word 'religion' include the Interim Constitution of the Republic of Korea (1919), the Proposal of Democratic Representatives (1946), and the Interim Constitution of Korea (1947). An exception is the Administrative Research Council Draft (1946), which uses the term 'freedom of religious faith.'\n\n\n** Baekbaekgyo, which originated from Donghak, began as a sect of Donghak, known as Baekdogyo (白道敎). In 1899, Donghak leader Jeon Jeong-un spent four years in meditation at Mt. Geumgang and then began to convert the people of Munchon County, Hamgyeongnam-do. In 1912, he established Baekdogyo with its headquarters in Osungsan, Geumhwa County, Gangwon-do, and by 1916, the number of believers had exceeded ten thousand. However, after Jeon Jeong-un's death in 1919, the sect experienced divisions among its followers.\n\n\nIn 1923, Jeon Jeong-un's eldest son, Jeon Yong-su, established Incheon-gyo (人天敎), while his second son, Jeon Yong-hae, founded Baekbaekgyo in Jeokmok-ri, Bukmyeon, Gapyeong County. His third son, Jeon Yong-seok, established Dohwagyo (道花敎). However, in 1930, it was revealed that Jeon Jeong-un had brutally murdered four concubines, leading to the arrest of Baekdogyo leaders one after another. Jeon Yong-su went into hiding, and Baekbaekgyo went underground. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nLarge Anti-trusteeship Meeting and Christianity, and Three Christian Leaders’ Different Directions\n\n\nBrief Summary of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission\n\n\nFollowing the decision of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which stipulated the establishment of a Provisional Government of Korea and the setup of a joint commission between the United States and the Soviet Union to aid this, the US-Soviet Joint Commission's preliminary meeting, known as the US-Soviet Joint Talks, was held on January 16, 1946, at the Deoksugung Stone Hall. Major General Arnold A.V. from the United States and Lieutenant General Shtikov T.E. from the Soviet Union co-chaired the meeting. The talks focused on the economic and administrative issues caused by the division but faced difficulties due to differences in positions and concluded on February 5 with a joint statement announcing the establishment of the US-Soviet Joint Commission within a month.\n\n\nThe first US-Soviet Joint Commission was convened in Seoul on March 20, 1946. As the talks began, the Soviet side proposed three criteria for selecting Korean consultees for the establishment of a provisional government: support for the decisions of the Three-Power Conference, genuine commitment to democracy, and not being anti-Soviet groups or individuals intending to turn Korea into a fortress against the Soviet Union.\n\n\nIn response, the US side contended it was unfair to exclude those who were principally opposed to the Moscow Agreement and, by extension, opposed to trusteeship.\n\n\nThrough this process, a compromise was eventually reached, and on April 17, the US-Soviet Joint Commission issued a joint statement, known as Communique No. 5, stating that political parties and organizations to be consulted must sign a declaration promising to support the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference agreement.\n\n\nHowever, subsequent disagreements over whether signing this declaration implied acceptance of trusteeship led to an impasse, and on May 6, an indefinite adjournment was declared.\n\n\nFollowing the failure of the first US-Soviet Joint Commission, right-wing factions led by Syngman Rhee advocated for a strong stance through the Jeongeup Declaration, while the moderate factions centered around Yo Un-hyung and Kim Kyu-sik pursued a left-right collaboration movement with US support. However, as an interim legislative assembly was established by the end of 1946, the US showed less enthusiasm for left-right collaboration, leading to its failure amidst non-participation from both political spectrums.\n\n\nIn 1947, due to internal and external pressures associated with delays in resolving the Korean issue, including the establishment of an independent state, the US and the Soviet Union made efforts to resume the US-Soviet Joint Commission. After prolonged negotiations through correspondence between Major General Hodge J.R., the commander of US forces in South Korea, and General Chistiakov I., the commander of Soviet forces in North Korea, as well as between US Secretary of State Marshall G.C. and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov V.M., the second US-Soviet Joint Commission resumed on May 21, 1947.\n\n\nWith the resumption of the commission, domestic political forces became active. Naturally, the left and moderate factions participated enthusiastically, and some right-wing factions, including the Hanmin Party, decided to join, stating that participation in the commission was inevitable for the establishment of a unified government and that the trusteeship issue should be opposed by national consensus after the establishment of a provisional government.\n\n\nEven some members of the Korea Independence Party led by Kim Gu, who was spearheading the anti-trusteeship movement, expressed their willingness to participate in the commission, leading to almost all political parties and social organizations, excluding the followers of Syngman Rhee and Kim Gu, submitting petitions to participate in the commission.\n\n\nBy June 25, a total of 425 political and social organizations from South Korea and 36 from North Korea had submitted petitions to the commission. However, the combined membership of these 461 organizations amounted to 70 million people, double the population at the time.\n\n\nAs scheduled, the US-Soviet representatives held a joint meeting with political and social organizations from South Korea on June 25 in Seoul and then traveled to Pyongyang to hold a plenary session for several days starting on June 30, followed by a joint meeting with North Korean political and social organizations on July 1.\n\n\nDespite seeming progress, the second US-Soviet Joint Commission once again reached a deadlock over the issue of consultation subjects. By August, the commission had reverted to the original points of contention from the first commission, with the Soviet side insisting on adhering to the decisions of the Three-Power Conference and the US side advocating for freedom of expression.\n\n\nThe situation worsened in mid-August when the US military government arrested numerous individuals from the South Korean Workers' Party and the leftist faction for alleged illegal activities, leading to heightened tensions.\n\n\nThe Soviet representative Shtikov strongly protested against the suppression of pro-Soviet leftists in South Korea, who had supported the decisions of the Moscow Conference and the commission's work, as an act that hindered the commission's efforts.\n\n\nIn response, the US representative, W.G. Brown, countered by saying it was \"interference in South Korea's internal affairs\" and demanded the release of important figures detained in North Korea, escalating the confrontation between the two sides. Eventually, the second US-Soviet Joint Commission reached a de facto breakdown in the summer of 1947.\n\n\nAs progress in the second US-Soviet Joint Commission seemed unattainable, the US abandoned the trusteeship plan for Korea and shifted the Korean issue to the United Nations (UN). On September 17, 1947, US Secretary of State Marshall, acknowledging the lack of results from two years of efforts by the US-Soviet Joint Commission, expressed hope that \"measures to achieve Korean independence without going through trusteeship would be devised, now that the Korean issue was brought before the UN General Assembly.\"\n\n\nIn opposition, the Soviet Union's chief delegate to the UN, A.Y. Vyshinsky, argued that bringing the Korean issue to the UN directly violated the agreement between the US and the Soviet Union. However, Marshall's proposal was approved on September 21 by the UN General Assembly's Steering Committee.\n\n\nSubsequently, at the 62nd plenary session of the US-Soviet Joint Commission held on October 18, the US chief delegate, Colonel Brown, proposed suspending the commission's work until the discussion on the Korean issue in the UN was concluded.\n\n\nIn response, the Soviet chief delegate, Shtikov, announced the withdrawal of the Soviet delegation from Seoul, and on October 21, a group of about 50 members of the Soviet delegation departed for Pyongyang, marking the end of the second US-Soviet Joint Commission after five months of twists and turns.\n\n\nThree leaders and Anti-Trusteeship Movement\n\n\nSyngman Rhee was the first to return to Korea, with the Korean Christian community in Hawaii being a significant supporter of his. Upon moving to Washington, he attended the Pound Methodist Church and developed a close relationship with Frederick B. Harris, the church's pastor, who had served as the chaplain of the US Senate and was a friend of Truman. Through Harris, Rhee was able to convey his views on the Korean Peninsula issue to President Truman. Christians holding key positions in the US military government were closely associated with Rhee.\n\n\nHis first action was to unite various political and social organizations to voice a unified desire for independence to the international community. On October 23, 1945, he attempted to gather over 50 political and social organizations into the Central Committee for the Promotion of Independence but faced opposition from the Communist Party, leading to little progress. On November 19, just before the return of Kim Gu's provisional government, Rhee held a press conference urging the participation of Christians, stating, \"It's incomprehensible that while religious groups such as Confucianism and Buddhism are actively involved, Christians remain passive. I hope they will be more active than during the March 1st Movement.\" Rhee's remarks encouraged Christians to participate more actively in the independence movement, with Methodist pastors being particularly proactive in using their churches as local organizational hubs.\n\n\nImmediately after liberation, Korean Christian leaders focused on creating a National Founding Committee but were soon overshadowed by organized activities of the leftists, backed by the Soviet Union's entry into Korea, leading most to retreat from the political forefront to observe the situation. However, with Rhee establishing the Central Committee for the Promotion of Independence and emphasizing Christian activities, they joined the committee and once again played a central role in the right-wing forces.\n\n\nKim Gu and Kim Gyu-sik, among other provisional government officials, returned on November 23. Kim Gu, who had various religious backgrounds, accepted Christianity but was not active in church life in China, despite maintaining deep connections with the Christian community. Notably, he received financial support from Korean Christians in America during difficult times and took refuge in the home of American missionary George McCune Ashmore after Yun Bong-gil's heroic act. Having been a de facto leader of the provisional government for a long time, Kim Gu had established significant relations with Christianity in Korea.\n\n\nKim Gyu-sik became a Christian after being adopted by missionary Underwood in his youth and became the first elder of Saemunan Church after studying in the United States. Although active church life was not possible during his exile in China, he never abandoned his Christian faith. After joining the provisional government in Chongqing in the early 1940s, he reconnected with foreign missionaries and actively engaged in Christian activities. American missionaries considered Kim Gyu-sik a vital future leader of Christianity in Korea. He was a well-known Christian in Korean society, and his cousin, Kim Kwan-sik, was one of the leading figures in the Korean church at the time.\n\n\nBoth Kim Gu and Kim Gyu-sik believed in centering their politics around Christian faith upon their return. Right after their return, on the 25th, Kim Gu, accompanied by Eom Hang-seop and Jang Jun-ha, attended a service at Jeongdong First Church, while Kim Gyu-sik attended his home church, Saemunan Church. This marked the beginning of their post-liberation Christian life in their homeland.\n\n\nIn November 1945, the Christian Conference of Southern Korea was held. Pastor Kim Kwan-sik, a cousin of Kim Gyu-sik, was the chairman. The conference supported the provisional government established at the time and, on behalf of Christians, proposed to the US military government the abolition of the 38th parallel. On the 28th, a welcoming event for the leaders of the provisional government was held, where they were invited to speak. Kim Gu first stated that he aimed to \"build the nation and the church simultaneously\" and advised, \"Instead of setting up ten police stations, build one church.\" He shared a phrase his mother always told him, \"Even if your family can't be with you, Jesus will never leave you.\"\n\n\nSyngman Rhee talked about how he entered Baehwa School and how he came to accept Christ in Hanyang Prison, stating, \"As we are about to build a new state, 'let's not build a house without a foundation.' Let's build this country on Christ, the eternal rock,\" emphasizing that unity is what we need now. Kim Gyu-sik, reflecting on his past exile as being in \"the seventh level of hell,\" felt like he was in \"the seventh heaven\" receiving such a welcome and stressed that building an impregnable nation is not by our strength but by God's power. Korean Christianity has the responsibility to lead Korean society, both politically and ecclesiastically.\n\n\nJust as the representatives of Christianity in South Korea welcomed the provisional government and the three right-wing leaders, a similar event occurred in North Korea. Immediately following the Southern Conference, on December 1, the North Korean Presbyterian General Assembly, representing the Presbyterian churches of the five northern provinces, was held. They resolved to send a delegation to the Allied Command in South Korea to express their gratitude. The real intention, however, behind Pastor Lee In-sik and elected representative Kim Yang-sun's expression of gratitude to the Allied Commander was to coordinate with the South Korean church on \"major events\" and to visit Syngman Rhee, who had returned from the US, and Kim Gu, who had returned from Chongqing. In other words, the North Korean Presbyterian Church sought to collaborate with the provisional government and right-wing representatives to build a new state.\n\n\nAs the right-wing Christian forces were working towards building a new state centered around the provisional government, a decision was made in Moscow to place the Korean Peninsula under trusteeship. The trusteeship had long been a post-war governance plan advocated by the United States. However, facing domestic opposition, the US proposed the trusteeship plan to bring the Soviet Union, occupying north of the 38th parallel, to the negotiation table. South Korea's right-wing strongly opposed this, and the anti-trusteeship movement was centered around Kim Gu's provisional government. Kim Gu crucially needed Christian support for the anti-trusteeship movement. Therefore, on December 28, 1945, the provisional government held an emergency cabinet meeting to mobilize \"all layers and factions of society, including churches nationwide,\" against the trusteeship. Kim Gu's provisional government considered Christianity a vital organization for the anti-trusteeship movement. During the trusteeship crisis, Kim Gu closely collaborated with Christianity in the anti-trusteeship movement, particularly expanding the movement to North Korea upon witnessing the North Korean Communist Party's support for trusteeship. Early in 1946, Kim Gu collaborated with individuals affiliated with the North Korean Democratic Party to conduct a vigorous terror campaign. Especially aiming to establish a stronghold in North Korea in preparation for national elections after reunification, he focused his efforts around Christianity in his birthplace, Hwanghae Province, making it a central location for his anti-trusteeship and anti-communist activities.\n\n\nOne of the most crucial issues in early 1946 was how to define the relationship between Syngman Rhee and Kim Gu. It had been agreed that Rhee would serve as the president and Kim Gu as the vice president. However, those around Kim Gu in the provisional government did not agree with this arrangement, especially the leftists within the government. Initially, Rhee wanted Kim Gu to join the Central Committee for the Promotion of Independence that he had established, but upon returning to Korea, Kim Gu seemed to prefer that Rhee work around his provisional government instead. Kim Gu led the anti-trusteeship movement and, leveraging this power, issued what was essentially \"National Decree No. 1,\" demanding that the US military government's administration and police submit to the provisional government. This was met with national support. Based on this public sentiment, Kim Gu gathered various domestic organizations on January 4, 1946, to form an Emergency Political Meeting, which was essentially in direct opposition to the US military government. General Hodge of the US military issued a strong warning to Kim Gu, who could not overcome the military government's actual control. In this context, on January 23, there was a proposal to merge Rhee's Central Committee and Kim Gu's Emergency Political Meeting, leading to the founding assembly at Myeongdong Cathedral on February 1. This Emergency National Assembly declared to inherit the legislative functions of the provisional government and take on the role of a transitional government, excluding the leftist forces of the provisional government because Rhee and Kim Gu already dominated this gathering, making the Assembly a coalition of right-wing forces.\n\n\nThe US military government reorganized this committee into the South Korean Representative Democratic Council (hereafter the Democratic Council) on February 14. The military government intended for the Democratic Council to serve as an advisory body to the military government and to nurture it into the future government representing South Korea. The Democratic Council elected Syngman Rhee as chairman, Kim Gyu-sik as vice-chairman, and Kim Gu as prime minister. Thus, the three Christian right-wing leaders emerged as the top leaders of South Korean society. This South Korean Democratic Council was a counterpart to the North Korean Provisional People's Committee already established in North Korea.\n\n\nOne of the most significant tasks for the right-wing faction after liberation was how to organize the positions of the three right-wing leaders. The relationship between Rhee and Kim Gu was complex. In terms of political career and seniority, Rhee was superior. However, Kim Gu was the chairman of the provisional government, while Rhee was the chairman of the provisional government's committee in Europe and America. From this perspective, Kim Gu could be considered superior. Yet, in reality, Kim Gu treated Rhee as a senior and had even proposed that Rhee act as the representative of the provisional government upon their return. With the establishment of the Democratic Council, the hierarchy among the right-wing leaders was determined: Chairman Syngman Rhee, Vice-chairman Kim Gyu-sik, and Prime Minister Kim Gu. Formally, the vice-chairman might seem superior, but it was largely a ceremonial position, with the prime minister being the true second-in-command. Therefore, the order among the right-wing leaders was confirmed as Syngman Rhee, Kim Gu, and Kim Gyu-sik. Kim Gu always considered himself the second-in-command after Rhee, while Kim Gyu-sik was the least independently powerful among the three.\n\n\nRhee was widely known as an anti-communist, and Kim Gu had spent his life fighting leftists within the provisional government. In contrast, Kim Gyu-sik originally held a moderate leftist position in China as the chairman of the Korean National Revolutionary Party alongside Kim Won-bong. However, his stance shifted around the time of liberation, aligning with Kim Gu's right-wing faction and engaging with the Christian community, a central right-wing force, upon returning to Korea. Amidst this, Kim Gyu-sik was known to have strongly criticized communism to the public.\n\n\nMarch 1946 was the period when the first US-Soviet Joint Commission was convened. The most critical task at hand was selecting representatives to establish a democratic provisional government, in accordance with Moscow's decisions. These representatives were to be figures representing various political parties and social organizations. Syngman Rhee and Kim Gu each had their supportive groups, but Kim Gyu-sik did not. In this context, Kim Gyu-sik was elected as the president of the Korean Christian Youth Association. Now, Kim Gyu-sik could attend meetings for the establishment of the provisional government, organized by the US-Soviet Joint Commission, as a representative of Christian youth. Kim Gyu-sik and the Christian youth became a communal comradeship.\n\n\nHowever, when the right-wing factions applied to participate in mass, the Soviet Union rejected their applications, stating that opposing trusteeship would violate the terms of Communique No. 5. Ultimately, the Soviets aimed to exclude right-wing figures and steer the provisional government towards the left. This frustration led the right-wing faction to engage in a strong anti-Soviet struggle.\n\n\nFollowing the breakdown of the US-Soviet Joint Commission, the US State Department sought a new direction. It aimed to bring moderate forces from both the left and the right to the forefront of politics to lead the Joint Commission to success. As Kim Gyu-sik took a firm stand on left-right collaboration, the Korean Christian Youth Association supported this initiative and issued a statement endorsing left-right collaboration on October 11, 1946.\n\n\nIn early 1947, the US agreed to impose certain restrictions on the right-wing's anti-trusteeship movement to bring the Soviet Union on board, leading to strong backlash from the right. According to this agreement, the right-wing would not be allowed to participate in the US-Soviet Joint Commission unless they abandoned their anti-trusteeship stance. In this situation, Kim Gyu-sik found himself in a difficult position. He was in a position to activate the legislative assembly to ensure the success of the Joint Commission, yet, like other right-wing figures, he opposed trusteeship. In this context, the Korean Christian Youth Association, Kim Gyu-sik's closest ally, also joined other right-wing groups in declaring opposition to trusteeship. However, his moderate stance on left-right collaboration was overshadowed by repeated failures in negotiations of the Joint Commission and the US military government's demands to halt the anti-trusteeship movement, distancing him from the Christian community. Subsequently, he was labeled a materialist and communist, losing his standing within the Christian community in South Korea.\n\n\n박명수.

Following World War II, the Allied military command agreed that the US military would advance south of the 38th parallel on the Korean Peninsula to disarm the Japanese forces stationed there at the time, while the Soviet military would move north of it. Subsequently, in August, the Soviets first established a military government in Pyongyang, and in September, the United States set up a military government in Seoul. The people of North and South Korea both opposed trusteeship, and as seen in the previous descriptions about the three Christian leaders, leaders of the Korean people who had been active in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai and returned to Korea also participated in the movement against trusteeship. However, they were not hostile towards the United States and the Soviet Union. This was because they needed the help of both the US and the Soviet Union to eliminate the remnants of Japanese colonial rule and to build a new country. It cannot be said whether the relationship with China during this period was friendly or not. Before 1945, China was focused on the war with Japan, and after 1945, the country was in turmoil due to the war between Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang and Mao Zedong of the Communist Party. However, it is said that during the Cairo Conference, Chiang Kai-shek defended Korea when discussing the issue of Japanese colonies after the war. The leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were not convinced that Korea was ready for independence, and Chiang Kai-shek, who had close relations with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, persuaded them that Korea was sufficiently prepared for independence. The outcome was the statement, “In due course Korea shall become free and independent.” Of course, Syngman Rhee and the Provisional Government in Shanghai immediately opposed the precondition of \"in due course,\" but Korea did achieve independence.\n\nhttps://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1943CairoTehran/d343\n\nhttps://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945Malta/d247\n\n배경한.

After the liberation in 1945, churches from the United States, Canada, and Australia began sending missionaries back to Korea and Japan. However, their churches and other properties had often been appropriated by the Japanese Empire, making access difficult. Notably, the Presbyterian Church in the USA and the Presbyterian Church in Canada had their main mission fields in North Korea, which was under Soviet military control, making access impossible. These missionaries became a significant supporting force for the government set up by the American military administration in South Korea. Syngman Rhee had strongly criticized Japan's oppression of Christianity even before liberation and was well-informed about the situation in the United States, hence receiving support from the missionaries. The American military administration employed the children of missionaries, who had knowledge about Korea and could speak Korean, in important government positions to quickly stabilize South Korea.\n\n\nReturning Process\n\nThe strong support for Christian missions by General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the Allied forces, and his administration can be seen in the United States' plans for the occupation of Japan. Around the time of Japan's surrender, the ultimate objectives of the United States in regard to Japan were to ensure that Japan would not again become a threat to the United States or world peace and security, and to establish a peaceful and responsible government that would respect the rights of other states and support the objectives of the United States as reflected in the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The United States desired this government to adhere as closely as possible to principles of democratic self-government, without the Allied Powers imposing any form of government not supported by the freely expressed will of the people.\n\n\nThe original statements:\n\nThe ultimate objectives of the United States in regard to Japan, to which policies in the initial period must conform, are:\n\n(a) To insure that Japan will not again become a menace to the United States or to the peace and security of the world.\n\n(b) To bring about the eventual establishment of a peaceful and responsible government which will respect the rights of other states and will support the objectives of the United States as reflected in the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The United States desires that this government should conform as closely as may be to principles of democratic self-government but it is not the responsibility of the Allied Powers to impose upon Japan any form of government not supported by the freely expressed will of the people. (“United States Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan”, August 29th 1945: https://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/shiryo/01/022/022tx.html#:~:text=The%20policy%20is%20to%20use,to%20be%20permitted%20and%20favored.)\n\nThe Allied forces viewed Japanese Shintoism as a strong supporter of militarism and an ideological motto that led to the Pacific War. William P. Woodard (1896-1974), working in the Civil Information and Education Section in Japan, interpreted this as the State Shrine Cult, piercing through the reality of religious oppression in Japan. This was evident in the encouragement of individual liberties and democratic processes, with freedom of religious worship being proclaimed promptly upon occupation. The separation of religious institutions was enacted on December 15, 1945, through the Shinto Directive, reflecting the Christian-supportive stance of MacArthur's administration. The mass employment of missionaries required solving housing and cost of living issues, with the slow entry of female missionaries due to a lack of housing space exacerbating the problem.\n\n\nThe use of churches and missionary properties occupied by the Japanese military as activity and housing areas by the American military administration was a significant reason. On September 25, 1945, the military administration issued Military Government Ordinance No. 2, imposing a freeze on the transfer of enemy property, and in December, Ordinance No. 33 was issued to formally manage Japanese properties as enemy assets. Properties of the missionary society that had been transferred to the Japanese government, including schools and lands, came under the control of the American military administration in December 1945, following Ordinance No. 33. Later, the military administration interpreted that while they were \"managing\" the properties, the \"legal ownership\" still remained with the missionary society.\n\n\nEntry of Missionaries\n\n\nThe Presbyterian Church in the USA began to select missionaries again for Korea upon its liberation. Around the time of liberation in October 1945, they added 6 more to the missionaries they had been preparing, creating a list of 16 missionaries. These individuals were called Group A and served as a vanguard, aiming to assist in the spiritual recovery of Korean Protestants, and to help rebuild the churches with relief and self-effort (J. L. Hooper to the Korea Mission, October 22, 1945, PCUSA). The Presbyterian Church in the USA held meetings from November 19 to 23, 1945, with these vanguard members to discuss whether it was feasible to send missionaries again. Among them, Roscoe C. Coen, Archibald G. Fletcher, and Ralph O. Reiner were given the authority to manage the properties of the Presbyterian Church in North Korea (J. L. Hooper to the Korea Mission, April 9, 1946). Many of the 16 included not only missionaries but also individuals who served as medical administrative advisors or other advisors, interpreters for the American military government.\n\n\nUntil the missionary society was organized in January 1948, they were active in various fields, supporting the policies of the American military government. As a significant number of American troops returned home in 1947, creating available living spaces, female missionaries began to enter the country. H.G. Underwood, the son of missionary Underwood, entered Korea in 1946 and worked in the Department of Cultural Education, rebuilding institutions such as Yeonhee College, founded by his father, and assisting its graduates in entering government and societal institutions, actively requesting the reconstruction of Protestantism under the American military government.\n\n\n안종철, & 정병준.
