Following World War II, the Allied military command agreed that the US military would advance south of the 38th parallel on the Korean Peninsula to disarm the Japanese forces stationed there at the time, while the Soviet military would move north of it. Subsequently, in August, the Soviets first established a military government in Pyongyang, and in September, the United States set up a military government in Seoul. The people of North and South Korea both opposed trusteeship, and as seen in the previous descriptions about the three Christian leaders, leaders of the Korean people who had been active in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai and returned to Korea also participated in the movement against trusteeship. However, they were not hostile towards the United States and the Soviet Union. This was because they needed the help of both the US and the Soviet Union to eliminate the remnants of Japanese colonial rule and to build a new country. It cannot be said whether the relationship with China during this period was friendly or not. Before 1945, China was focused on the war with Japan, and after 1945, the country was in turmoil due to the war between Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang and Mao Zedong of the Communist Party. However, it is said that during the Cairo Conference, Chiang Kai-shek defended Korea when discussing the issue of Japanese colonies after the war. The leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were not convinced that Korea was ready for independence, and Chiang Kai-shek, who had close relations with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, persuaded them that Korea was sufficiently prepared for independence. The outcome was the statement, “In due course Korea shall become free and independent.” Of course, Syngman Rhee and the Provisional Government in Shanghai immediately opposed the precondition of \"in due course,\" but Korea did achieve independence.\n\nhttps://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1943CairoTehran/d343\n\nhttps://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945Malta/d247\n\n배경한.

After the liberation in 1945, churches from the United States, Canada, and Australia began sending missionaries back to Korea and Japan. However, their churches and other properties had often been appropriated by the Japanese Empire, making access difficult. Notably, the Presbyterian Church in the USA and the Presbyterian Church in Canada had their main mission fields in North Korea, which was under Soviet military control, making access impossible. These missionaries became a significant supporting force for the government set up by the American military administration in South Korea. Syngman Rhee had strongly criticized Japan's oppression of Christianity even before liberation and was well-informed about the situation in the United States, hence receiving support from the missionaries. The American military administration employed the children of missionaries, who had knowledge about Korea and could speak Korean, in important government positions to quickly stabilize South Korea.\n\n\nReturning Process\n\nThe strong support for Christian missions by General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the Allied forces, and his administration can be seen in the United States' plans for the occupation of Japan. Around the time of Japan's surrender, the ultimate objectives of the United States in regard to Japan were to ensure that Japan would not again become a threat to the United States or world peace and security, and to establish a peaceful and responsible government that would respect the rights of other states and support the objectives of the United States as reflected in the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The United States desired this government to adhere as closely as possible to principles of democratic self-government, without the Allied Powers imposing any form of government not supported by the freely expressed will of the people.\n\n\nThe original statements:\n\nThe ultimate objectives of the United States in regard to Japan, to which policies in the initial period must conform, are:\n\n(a) To insure that Japan will not again become a menace to the United States or to the peace and security of the world.\n\n(b) To bring about the eventual establishment of a peaceful and responsible government which will respect the rights of other states and will support the objectives of the United States as reflected in the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The United States desires that this government should conform as closely as may be to principles of democratic self-government but it is not the responsibility of the Allied Powers to impose upon Japan any form of government not supported by the freely expressed will of the people. (“United States Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan”, August 29th 1945: https://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/shiryo/01/022/022tx.html#:~:text=The%20policy%20is%20to%20use,to%20be%20permitted%20and%20favored.)\n\nThe Allied forces viewed Japanese Shintoism as a strong supporter of militarism and an ideological motto that led to the Pacific War. William P. Woodard (1896-1974), working in the Civil Information and Education Section in Japan, interpreted this as the State Shrine Cult, piercing through the reality of religious oppression in Japan. This was evident in the encouragement of individual liberties and democratic processes, with freedom of religious worship being proclaimed promptly upon occupation. The separation of religious institutions was enacted on December 15, 1945, through the Shinto Directive, reflecting the Christian-supportive stance of MacArthur's administration. The mass employment of missionaries required solving housing and cost of living issues, with the slow entry of female missionaries due to a lack of housing space exacerbating the problem.\n\n\nThe use of churches and missionary properties occupied by the Japanese military as activity and housing areas by the American military administration was a significant reason. On September 25, 1945, the military administration issued Military Government Ordinance No. 2, imposing a freeze on the transfer of enemy property, and in December, Ordinance No. 33 was issued to formally manage Japanese properties as enemy assets. Properties of the missionary society that had been transferred to the Japanese government, including schools and lands, came under the control of the American military administration in December 1945, following Ordinance No. 33. Later, the military administration interpreted that while they were \"managing\" the properties, the \"legal ownership\" still remained with the missionary society.\n\n\nEntry of Missionaries\n\n\nThe Presbyterian Church in the USA began to select missionaries again for Korea upon its liberation. Around the time of liberation in October 1945, they added 6 more to the missionaries they had been preparing, creating a list of 16 missionaries. These individuals were called Group A and served as a vanguard, aiming to assist in the spiritual recovery of Korean Protestants, and to help rebuild the churches with relief and self-effort (J. L. Hooper to the Korea Mission, October 22, 1945, PCUSA). The Presbyterian Church in the USA held meetings from November 19 to 23, 1945, with these vanguard members to discuss whether it was feasible to send missionaries again. Among them, Roscoe C. Coen, Archibald G. Fletcher, and Ralph O. Reiner were given the authority to manage the properties of the Presbyterian Church in North Korea (J. L. Hooper to the Korea Mission, April 9, 1946). Many of the 16 included not only missionaries but also individuals who served as medical administrative advisors or other advisors, interpreters for the American military government.\n\n\nUntil the missionary society was organized in January 1948, they were active in various fields, supporting the policies of the American military government. As a significant number of American troops returned home in 1947, creating available living spaces, female missionaries began to enter the country. H.G. Underwood, the son of missionary Underwood, entered Korea in 1946 and worked in the Department of Cultural Education, rebuilding institutions such as Yeonhee College, founded by his father, and assisting its graduates in entering government and societal institutions, actively requesting the reconstruction of Protestantism under the American military government.\n\n\n안종철, & 정병준.
