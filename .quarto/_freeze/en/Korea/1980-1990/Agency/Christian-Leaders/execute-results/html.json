From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.\n\nRaised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev. Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, “Solving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,” acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.\n\nIn the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled “Human Rights of 50 Million Koreans.” The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement—“Jeon Tae-il’s death is not a grave, not the end of life—it is a resurrection that brings new hope”—reflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation's conscience. Moon’s activism found fuller expression during South Korea’s pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (민통련), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the “economic democratization of everyday life,” arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor.\n\nBut the most defining moment of Moon’s prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North’s regime: “The most serious obstacle to reunification from the South’s point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn’t Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?” Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. “I did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,” he told Kim.\n\nThis encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4·2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:\n\nThe three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity\n\nThat Korea, despite its division, is “one nation and one state”\n\nA shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions\n\nA consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately\n\nThis framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a “loose federal system.” Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society—and the Christian community in particular—was starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely “Mr. Moon Ik-hwan” to deny his clerical identity. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.\n\nIn contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon’s visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality.\n\nDespite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that “reunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.” His vision transcended the binary of \"reunification first\" or \"democratization first,\" instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon’s legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as “a reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.”\n\n\nTable 1.  Moon’s Key Activities\n\n| Year | Activity/Event | Type | Significance/Reaction |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Start of activities in the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification | Politics · Reunification | Institutionalization of civilian-led reunification efforts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1983 | Elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall | Human Rights · Memorial | Inheriting the legacy of the labor movement and expanding public support |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987 | Participation in the June Democratic Uprising | Democratization | Participation in mass civil resistance; mixed response from religious communities |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989 | Visit to Pyongyang and meeting with Kim Il-sung | Reunification · Religion | Historic civilian inter-Korean dialogue; arrested upon return |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n김수환 추기경 金壽煥 Stephen Kim Sou-hwan\n\n07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009\n\n\nCardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike. \n\nHis moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. “If the government sends troops to Gwangju,” he warned, “it will be an unforgivable sin in Korea’s modern history”. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.\n\nThe defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them—but protected them. “The Church must remain a place of peace,” he said. “Violence cannot coexist with the Church”. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.\n\nHe recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. “Justice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,” he declared. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.\n\nHe never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: “What truly damages the people’s dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it”. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‘apolitical,’ he challenged that notion, stating, “Whenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.”\n\nKim’s resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. “If there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,” he said. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. “Through suffering,” one widow told him years after her husband’s death, “I drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.”\n\nCardinal Kim’s greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him—not out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.\n\nHe believed that the Church must not only answer to God—it must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.\n\n\nTable 2.

Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea’s authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No. 9, he became convinced that “personal goodness was powerless before structural evil” and expanded his pastoral practice “from saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.”\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled “The Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots” delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a “murderer,” accused the U.S. of “complicity in the massacre,” and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent. This was more than a spiritual message—it was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.\n\nKo emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized “democratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.”\n\nFrom the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (비전향 장기수), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come “after democratization” and that Christian reunification must be rooted in “love as the foundation.” Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their “conversion, human rights, and faith transformation” as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, “opened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.”\n\nWithin the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof. Choi Young-geun noted, Ko’s theology was “a lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,” grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.\n\nHis consistent proclamation—that true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed—remains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.\n\n\nTable 3. Key Activities\n\n\n| Year | Activity | Type | Description and Significance | Outcome |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Kim Jae-gyu Clemency Campaign | Human Rights / Political Resistance | Advocated for clemency for the man who assassinated Park Chung-hee. Sought support from national figures like Yun Bo-seon and missionaries. | Demonstrated moral responsibility of clergy in political affairs despite limited institutional backing. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1982 | Sermon at the 2nd Gwangju Uprising Memorial ('The Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots') | Prophetic Preaching | Condemned Chun Doo-hwan as 'murderer,' accused U.S. of complicity, and rebuked the church’s silence. | Led to arrest and interrogation; ignited new theological discourse on the church’s prophetic role. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1983 | Clemency Campaign for Moon Bu-sik and Kim Hyun-jang | Justice Advocacy | Delivered a sermon titled 'Let Us Establish Justice' despite state pressure; detained for 41 days. | Intensified state scrutiny but affirmed the moral autonomy of church-led justice initiatives. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987 | Participation in June Democratic Uprising | Democratization | Participated in protests alongside civic and religious leaders. | Strengthened alliances between the church and democratic movements. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1988–1990s | Support for Unconverted Long-Term Prisoners | Reunification / Human Rights | Organized church-based support and corresponded with imprisoned former North Korean agents. | Pioneered Christian-led reconciliation efforts; redefined love and justice in a divided nation. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n김영삼 金泳三 Young-sam Kim\n\n01/14/1929 ~ 11/22/2015\n\n\nThe 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.\n\nOne of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, “It was an obedience to the mission given by God.” He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance.\n\nHis hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a “man of faith in politics,” and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, “Let the river of freedom flow.” This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life.\n\nChristian media and national outlets portrayed Kim’s actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the “Presbyterian president” in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics.\n\nMoreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim’s actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.\n\nIn summary, Kim Young-sam’s political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea’s democratization.\n\n\n한경직 韓景職 Kyung-Chik Han\n\n12/29/1902 ~ 04/19/2000\n\n\nDuring the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.\n\nHis presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a “movement of national purification through the gospel”. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.\n\nWhen the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea’s burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han’s reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.\n\nHe redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea’s “Golden Fishing Ground” for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.\n\nHan’s leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church—especially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches—Han served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han’s message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps.\n\nPerhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987–88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid—carried out through church networks rather than government agencies—demonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel's call to love enemies and feed the hungry. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.\n\nThroughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church’s vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women’s shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that “the church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins”. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han’s ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.\n\nIn all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik’s legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force—firm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.\n\n\nTable 4. Key Activities\n\n| Domain | Main Activities | Significance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| National Evangelization Movement | Large-scale evangelistic rallies; trans-denominational church unity | Spread evangelical Christianity nationwide |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Humanitarian Aid to North Korea | Proposed non-governmental food aid (rice) to North Korea | Example of evangelical engagement in reconciliation and relief |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Industrial Mission | Tried to evangelize laborers; clashed with labor rights issues | Effort for social change; failed due to political tensions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Military Evangelization | Evangelism in the military, inspired by 'Golden Fishing Ground' strategy | Model of state-supported anti-communist evangelism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ecumenical Unity | Bridge-builder between conservative and progressive denominations | Symbol of ecumenical collaboration in Korean Christianity |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Social Welfare | Founded orphanages, elderly care homes, and other welfare centers | Embodied holistic gospel; enhanced church’s public image |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n김대중 金大中 Dae-jung Kim\n\n01/06/1924 ~ 08/18/2009\n\n\nEven before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea’s modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the “Seoul Spring.” Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan’s military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.\n\nOn May 17, 1980, Chun’s military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This “Kim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case” was the centerpiece of Chun’s strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, “The two distinct events—Kim’s alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre—were deliberately linked by the military regime’s fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance”.\n\nThrough military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but “a political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship”. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States\n\nDuring his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his Letters from Prison, Kim wrote, “Following Jesus means bearing the cross—that is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged”. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as “the liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner”.\n\nHis prison writings articulate a theology of “social salvation” grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. “True Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,” he wrote. “Without both, we cannot claim to have real faith”. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: “If Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well”.\n\nHis return to Korea in 1985—despite the threat of renewed repression—marked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.\n\nTo the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. “If there were no God,” he once said, “there would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to”. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, “Kim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation—precisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives”.\n\nIn retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung’s theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology—a discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.\n\n\nKim Dae-jung vs. Kim Young-sam in the 1980s\n\nThe inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung’s long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea’s democratic transition—one marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.\n\nTo highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam’s major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea’s path to democracy—revealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.\n\n\nTable 5.

More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho’s innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers.\n\nAt the heart of Cho’s theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public's longing for restoration and wholeness. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho’s teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho’s doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology’s understanding of regeneration. Cho’s sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. “The message of 3 John 1:2,” he often said, “declares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers”. His leadership style was transcendental—based on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit’s indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy.\n\nIn 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho’s theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an “occult healing” gospel. Others labeled his theology as “New Age Christianity.” Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful.\n\nDespite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho’s ministry into the Protestant mainstream. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach.\n\nIn sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy—massive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.\n\n\nTable 7.

Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea’s ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Rev. Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology. \n\nIn 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic “Declaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace” (commonly known as the “’88 Declaration”), which Rev. Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation. \n\nThe apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev. Kwon and Dr. Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev. Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled “Jesus Christ Who Makes Us One,” based on Ephesians 2:13–18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995. Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev. Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events. \n\nThese were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul’s shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea’s rapidly industrializing society. \n\nDuring his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev. Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform. \n\nRev. Kwon’s 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony—“What remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope”—continues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today. \n\n\n최성묵 목사 Sung-mook Choi\n\n11/11/1930 ~ 03/22/1992\n\n\nRev. Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church’s youth group—a movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising).\n\nThe Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime—marking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system’s survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting “Abolish Yushin!” and soon clashed with police and government buildings. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee’s assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.\n\nIn response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising’s ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.\n\nRev. Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea’s Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising—a clear example of the regime’s ideological paranoia. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute – Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as “a social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,” advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism.\n\nChoi’s initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens’ Council (1985) and later the Citizens' Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan’s civic and democratic infrastructure.\n\n\n박형규 목사 \n\n08/25/1923 ~ 08/18/2016\n\n\nRev. Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation—they became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.\n\nFollowing the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime’s nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as Kukbon) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.\n\nIn June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations—including labor groups, teachers’ unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances—Park provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. “Prayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,” he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.\n\nPark’s participation was not merely political—it was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, “Jesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.” In his sermons, he often declared, “Peace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.” Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.\n\nTheologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park’s contributions by noting that “as a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,” and that his efforts “had a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.” Park’s solidarity was not simply a political choice—it was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.\n\n\n지학순 주교 池學淳 Daniel Tji Hak-soun\n\n09/09/1921 ~ 05/12/1993\n\n\nBishop Tji Hak-soun’s activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church’s model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become “the face of Christ” in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.\n\nHis imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church’s calling in an oppressive era. It was said that “he offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,” showing that the Church’s neutrality could yield to the demand for justice. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church’s active role in Korea’s democratization movement throughout the 1980s.\n\nHis commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, “Priests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year’s pastoral goals”. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council’s call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world.\n\nHe opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.\n\nAmong his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers’ Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, “Bishop Tji, along with Fr. Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread”.\n\nHis activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of \"Integral Human Development,\" which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded “ecological conversion” that changes one’s lifestyle. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis’s teaching on integral ecology in Laudato Si’.\n\nTji’s theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for “the decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity”. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ’s love in the world.\n\nBishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church’s vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice—seeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.\n\n\nTable 8. Key Activities and Significance of Bishop Tji\n\n| Year / Period | Activity | Significance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 (early) | Led Masses and public statements for justice, peace, and human rights | Offered a model of faith-based resistance to political oppression and reaffirmed the Church’s social mission. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1984 | Participated in Catholic Farmers’ Movement and life-based ecology activism | Implemented Catholic social teaching through life-centered agriculture and ecological justice. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1985 | Promoted urban-rural direct trade networks | Proposed an alternative community model through solidarity between producers and consumers. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1986 | Organized cooperatives and founded grassroots schools | Helped the marginalized gain self-reliance, turning the Church into a center for education and economic development. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mid-1980s | Supported and spread the early Hansalim Movement | Provided theological and organizational grounding for a consumer-led life and justice movement. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1985–1989 | Advocated for decentered ecclesiology | Provided theological foundation for a Church that serves Christ and humanity rather than institutional self-preservation. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1986–1989 | Initiated the founding of the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) | Played a pivotal role in systematizing the Korean Catholic Church’s involvement in democratization movements. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987 | Participated in democratization campaigns post-June Struggle | Supported democratic transition with spiritual leadership and civic solidarity. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Late 1980s | Embodied Vatican II teachings in local Church reforms | Deeply understood and implemented the Church’s role in the modern world, promoting decentralization and reform. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n김지하 金芝河 Ji-ha Kim\n\n02/04/1941 ~ 05/08/2022\n\n\nThe 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941–2022), one of South Korea’s most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life—what he came to call saengmyeong sasang (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.\n\nKim's post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with Jang Il-soon and Bishop Ji Hak-soon in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being “calm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement”. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report “The Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life”, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals.\n\nYet Kim's journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:\n\n“I am returning to my hometown.”“Where, Mokpo?”“No, Donghak.”“You mean Cheondogyo?”“No, my own inner Donghak.”\n\nKim named this internal shift “Won Donghak” (Original Donghak)—a revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.\n\nHis ecological vision, articulated in texts like \"I Am Rice\", \"The Song of the Southern Boat\", and \"The Carrier of Life: The Minjung\", offered a new framework for Korean minjung discourse. For Kim, the minjung were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of life (saengmyeong), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos.\n\nThis transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim’s departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak—“my own inner Donghak”—provoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church’s boundaries.\n\nSecond, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim’s redefinition of minjung as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms—a framework that seeded the development of minjung ecology, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities.\n\nFinally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha’s saengmyeong sasang contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based saenghwal undong (life movement), and early versions of Korea’s environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim’s influence. His insistence that “a revolution must also be spiritual” extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.\n\nWhile he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called “a creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos” signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought.\n\n\nTable 9.  Religious Transformation and Social Impact\n\n| Period | Religious Identity / Orientation | Key Activities | Societal Impact |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960s–1970s | Catholic-influenced lay activist | Studied Vatican II documents with Jang Il-soon and Ji Hak-soon; supported justice-centered Catholicism. | Strengthened the link between Catholic social teaching and the democratization movement in Wonju. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Early 1980s | Catholic–Minjung hybrid thinker | Co-authored “The Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life”; initiated ecological discourse. | Inspired progressive theologians and activists to rethink minjung through ethics of life and coexistence. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mid–Late 1980s | “Won Donghak” (Original Donghak); personal syncretic spirituality | Declared spiritual departure from institutional religion; promoted saengmyeong sasang rooted in Donghak and ecology. | Encouraged the founding of Hansalim and life cooperatives; offered an alternative to both church and Marxist dogma. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n장기려 張起呂Gi-ryeo Jang\n\n10/05/1911 ~ 12/25/1995\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Dr. Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea’s first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea. Prior to the launch of Korea’s National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.\n\nFounded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. “Anyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,” making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that “ensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision”.\n\nDr. Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative’s newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, “The Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth”.\n\nThe cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea’s health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40–50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%.\n\nWhen the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr. Jang’s leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.\n\n\nTable 10.

Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan’s regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published Stories of Minjung Theology and other key works that consolidated his theological system.\n\nDuring this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection Korean National Movement and Reunification developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that “true unification must come from the people themselves.” He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (ki), overcoming anti-unification forces (seung), emergence of minjung as agents (jeon), and realizing peace through minjung (gyeol).\n\nAhn’s most striking development in this era was his deepening of minjung messianism. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida’s idea of the messianic without messianism, he argued that minjung messiah “does not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.” This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.\n\nToward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from “activist theology” to a more sensitive “theology of suffering.” He lamented that “migrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives—even within minjung theology.”⁷ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward “the different textures of suffering.” This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.\n\n\n김준곤 목사 金俊坤 Joon Gon Kim\n\n03/28/1925 ~ 09/29/2009\n\n\nRev. Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea’s evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan—“the whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city”—reflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.\n\nKim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin’s Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin’s Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a \"substitute beggar,\" a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people’s daily needs with sacrificial love.\n\nIn the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the “EXPO ’80” World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the “100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,” embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing.\n\nKim’s emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the \"Love’s Long Johns Project,\" the \"Organ Donation Campaign,\" the \"Coal Briquette Sharing Movement,\" free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill. In 1996, he launched the “Food Bank” movement, advocating the biblical principle that “the right to live surpasses the right to property” in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea. By 2007, he initiated the “North Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,” in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North.\n\nKim’s theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant’s emphasis on “both the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian’s social responsibility.” He consistently modeled what he called the “Whole Gospel”—a unified ministry of evangelism and justice.\n\nThis theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until “Christ becomes Lord of all.” He declared this “Jesus Revolution” in his New Year’s Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement.\n\nUltimately, Kim Jun-gon’s ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view—a model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.\n\n\n이영빈  목사 Young-Bin Lee\n\n1926 ~ 12/14/2018\n\n\nIn the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity—it was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the “third way,” which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.\n\nLee was deeply influenced by Barth’s vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.\n\nHe saw reunification as a theological task: “The gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders—it tears them down”. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God’s justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides—a prophetic confrontation with history. “Both North and South must confess their sins toward one another,” he repeatedly emphasized.\n\nThis perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that “the community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.” He famously declared, “In Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God”. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.\n\nLee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church’s own language—evangelism, worship, and prayer. “Prayer,” he said, “transcends confrontation and makes solidarity possible”. During the first North–South religious dialogue, participants prayed together—a moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.\n\nAt the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. “The Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,” he said. He further warned, “When Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross”. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.\n\nLee’s praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings—they were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAs Lee often said, “True reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God’s people”. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative—one that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.\n\n\nDorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)\n\n02/24/1938 ~ 08/30/2024\n\n\nThe 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.\n\nSchweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. “She had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture”. She assisted in editing Ahn’s letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as Jürgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.\n\nHer mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers’ protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation—she served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. “She was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches”.\n\nIn May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: “Her circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea’s democratic movement”. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as “someone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea’s situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution”.\n\nOne of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu’s long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. “She was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile”.\n\nSchweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center’s operations.\n\nHer work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, “Korea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth”.\n\nDorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present—listening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.\n\n ",
