Deeply influenced by both Latin American liberation theology and Korea’s turbulent democratization process, it offered a theological alternative to both Western dogmatism and politically conservative Korean churches. However, the 1980s marked a critical turning point—not only because of the theological sophistication of Minjung thinkers, but also due to intensified internal tensions and external criticisms. Three core controversies that defined Minjung theology in the 1980s are: its confrontation with conservative Christian orthodoxy, internal disagreements over the identity and role of the Minjung, and feminist critiques that exposed its gendered limitations. These debates did not signal the end of Minjung theology but rather enabled its renewal and transformation into a broader theological discourse of justice, solidarity, and intersectionality.\n\n\nHeresy or Prophecy? Conflict with Conservative Churches\n\nOne of the most persistent challenges facing Minjung theology in the 1980s was the accusation of heresy. Conservative Protestant denominations such as the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Hapdong) and the Kosin Church viewed Minjung theology not as an indigenous theological movement but as an ideological threat contaminated by Marxism and influenced by Latin American radicalism. Theologians like Ahn Byung-mu and Suh Nam-dong were often denied teaching platforms, and church publications warned believers against “pro-North Korean theology.” One pastor famously stated, “Minjung theology does not teach faith in Christ—it seeks to replace Christ with the Minjung as redeemer.”\n\nThe heart of the conflict lay in biblical hermeneutics. Minjung theologians interpreted Scripture through the lens of lived suffering and collective resistance. Ahn’s reading of the ochlos in the Gospel of Mark redefined the crowd not as a passive mob but as active historical agents who stood with Jesus against the religious elite. For conservatives committed to scriptural literalism and theological orthodoxy, this was a dangerous politicization of the gospel. Craig L. Mulling characterizes this conflict as a “discursive battle between orthodoxy and heterodoxy.” He writes, “Minjung theology used the language of liberation to justify moral purification through resistance, while conservative theology used the language of orthodoxy to sanctify state violence and developmental authoritarianism.” This clash reached its peak when the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)—a body supportive of Minjung theology—issued the 1988 “Declaration on the Peaceful Reunification of the Korean People.” The declaration called division a sin and proclaimed that Christians had a moral duty to support reunification efforts.\n\nThe backlash was immediate. Conservative leaders claimed the NCCK was legitimizing the North Korean regime and betraying national security. In response, they established the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) in 1989 as an alternative ecumenical body, explicitly rejecting NCCK’s “pro-communist” theology. The two councils embodied not only different theological frameworks but divergent political theologies: the NCCK emphasized justice and reconciliation, while the CCK advocated gospel-centered reunification through evangelization of the North.\n\n\nFragmentation Within: Competing Definitions of the Minjung\n\nWhile external critics condemned Minjung theology as political heresy, internal tensions were also mounting—especially over the definition of the “Minjung.” Although the term literally means “the people,” its theological content varied widely. Ahn Byung-mu viewed the Minjung as historical agents of resistance, symbolized by the ochlos, who confronted structural injustice alongside Jesus. Suh Nam-dong, by contrast, emphasized the existential suffering of the Minjung as those who bore han—a deep, unresolved pain rooted in oppression and historical trauma.\n\nYi Sam-yeol sought to move beyond both symbolic resistance and existential pathos by positioning the Minjung within civil society. He proposed that Minjung theology evolve into a “public theology” aligned with democratic institutions. “The Minjung,” he wrote, “must now appear not only in resistance but also as citizens asserting their dignity within institutions.”\n\nThese divergent interpretations raised theological questions about whether Minjung theology could maintain coherence without a shared anthropology. Hwang Yong-yeon’s later writings reflected this tension when he argued that “the Minjung are no longer a people—they are a position revealed in suffering”. Such conceptual shifts forced the movement to grapple with questions of historical subjectivity, symbolic representation, and theological boundaries.\n\n\nFeminist Interventions: Gender Blindness and Theological Renewal\n\nThe most piercing critique of Minjung theology in the 1980s came from feminist theologians, who challenged the movement’s male-dominated structure and theological framework. Chun Hyung-Kyung captured the essence of this critique when she declared, “Women are the Minjung within the Minjung. Under the name of the people, women have again been silenced.”\n\nFeminist critiques highlighted the way Minjung theology prioritized the experience of male industrial workers, while neglecting domestic laborers, rural women, and victims of state-sanctioned sexual violence. For Chun, Minjung theology replicated patriarchal patterns under the guise of liberation. Park Soon-Kyung extended this critique through a theological lens. As a key architect of reunification theology, she insisted that national reconciliation must be grounded in maternal spirituality and women’s experiences of caregiving and embodiment. “Women’s theology is the spiritual foundation of reunification,” she wrote, “and it begins in God’s maternal image.”\n\nThese feminist interventions expanded Minjung theology beyond class-based oppression, pushing it to confront the intersectionality of gender, violence, and the symbolic language of salvation. This opened space for what would later become feminist Minjung theology—a discourse centered not on resistance alone, but on healing, memory, and relational ethics.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Minjung theology stood at a crossroads. Externally, it was condemned as heretical and politically subversive; internally, it struggled with competing definitions of its core terms and growing critiques from feminist and regional voices. Yet these very debates were what transformed Minjung theology from a doctrinal movement into a living discourse. Rather than signaling fragmentation or decline, the controversies of the 1980s enabled Minjung theology to undergo a necessary metamorphosis. Through theological debate, ecclesial resistance, and the inclusion of new voices, it evolved into a multi-vocal theology of justice and intersectional solidarity. In so doing, Minjung theology remained faithful to its original task: to interpret the gospel from the underside of history.\n\n\nTheology from Women’s Perspective \n\n\nThe 1980s in South Korea was a time when the streets echoed with cries for democratization, and within churches, the long-silenced voices of women began to emerge. In this climate, feminist theology did not merely seek to argue for women’s rights within the church; it sought to radically reframe theological language, structures, and the very imagination of God. What began as questions within the church matured into a full-fledged theological movement—one that aimed to upend the theological paradigm itself. This movement originated from a challenge to the language structure of the Korean church, where women's silence had long been normalized. Feminist theologians pointed out that the male-centered language of the church—particularly addressing God solely as “Father”—contributed to the erasure of women’s experience and existence. Jung Hyun-sook stated, “Is God male? The Bible doesn’t say so, but that’s what we believe. And that belief has structurally deleted the presence of women”.\n\nThese claims drew sharp criticism from conservative theologians. A theology chair from a major conservative denomination publicly condemned the phrase “Mother God” as “radical feminism that destroys the Bible and leans toward heresy.” In response, Kim Eun-hee stated, “We’re not feminizing God—we’re dismantling the patriarchal imagination that insists God must be male”. This debate over language quickly evolved into a larger question: Who has the authority to interpret God? Whose experience is theology allowed to speak of?\n\nAnother critical controversy centered on the ordination of women. Beginning in the mid-1980s, feminist theologians launched theological and institutional efforts to secure the legitimacy of women's ordination. However, most denominations either flatly rejected or tactically avoided the issue. Jung Mi-hyun declared at a seminar, “A woman’s calling is not granted by the church—it is given by God. And the church has closed its ears to that call”. These discussions were not adequately described by the term “church feminism.” Rather, they possessed a subversive theological character. During this time, feminist theology deepened its engagement with Minjung theology. While Minjung theology spoke of “the God of the oppressed,” feminist theologians pointed out that the image of the oppressed was overwhelmingly male. Kim Eun-hee asked, “Is the woman dying in the kitchen not a Minjung? Is a woman who sells her body for her family, only to be condemned for it, not today’s oppressed?” Thus, feminist theology both embraced and critiqued Minjung theology—sharing its structural analysis of oppression while confronting its gender exclusion. It became clear that feminist theology was not simply a supplement to existing theology; it sought to re-center theological discourse itself.\n\nIn 1987, several attempts were made to formally introduce feminist theology courses at institutions such as Methodist Theological University, Ewha Womans University’s School of Theology, and Hanshin University. These efforts were met with fierce resistance. Some professors and conservative denominational figures claimed such teachings would “ideologize theological education”. One professor at MTU reportedly argued that feminist theology courses would “undermine ecclesiastical order,” and some classes were forced to operate as unofficial seminars. Despite this, students and women’s organizations mobilized to support the courses. A student from one such class said afterward, “For the first time, I felt I was allowed to speak. The church told me to stay silent, but the Bible told me to speak”\n\nAnother wave of opposition came in the form of labeling feminist theology as heretical. Conservative critics argued that it was rooted in “ideological feminism” rather than Christian doctrine, and some public lectures by feminist theologians were cancelled or banned. Jung Hyun-sook responded in a lecture, “We are not abandoning doctrine—we are speaking on behalf of those whom doctrine has abandoned. That is the recovery of the gospel”.\n\nToward the end of the decade, feminist theology expanded into discourses of life, the body, and ecology, challenging anthropocentric salvation doctrines and domination-centered theology. Eco-feminist theology emerged, aiming to build a “life-giving theology.” Kim Young-joo argued, “The Genesis command to ‘subdue and rule over’ has operated as language of oppression for both nature and women. We must begin a theology that listens again to life”.\n\nFinally, the 1980s marked the beginning of international solidarity for Korean feminist theologians. They engaged with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EATWOT), and other global networks to build shared feminist theological discourse. At the 1988 Asian Women Theologians Conference in Manila, the declaration “Patriarchal theology kills our God” was read aloud. Korean theologians were present, connecting Korean feminist theology to a wider global theological movement.\n\nFeminist theological thought in Korea initially emerged through challenges to gender discrimination within the church—calls for voice, presence, and equality. These were often received as internal reforms or seen through the lens of liberal feminism. But as feminist theologians began generating their own theological vocabulary, frameworks, and communities, they moved beyond the boundaries of ecclesiastical critique. They posed radical questions about who theology exists for, how God is imagined, and what it means to speak of salvation from the perspective of the silenced and wounded.\n\nThis marked a paradigm shift from calls for inclusion to the construction of an alternative theological worldview. Feminist theology in Korea did not stop at asking for room in the existing house—it sought to rebuild the house altogether. ",
