Amid these structural upheavals, Korean Christian student movements divided into two distinct streams. One focused on national evangelization and personal salvation, while the other stood with the oppressed and sought structural justice. Though both streams were rooted in Christian faith, their understanding and practice of the Gospel diverged sharply.\n\nEvangelical Stream: CCC and National Evangelization\n\nIn the 1980s, one of the most influential Christian student organizations in South Korea was the Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC). Founded in the early 1960s by Rev. Kim Jun-gon, CCC entered the new decade with an ambitious spiritual and national vision that went far beyond personal faith. This vision was encapsulated in the slogan: “Evangelization of the Nation, Unification of the Nation, and Globalization of the Nation.” Kim believed that South Korea, as a divided and vulnerable country surrounded by communist powers, could only be truly secure and prosperous if it was spiritually renewed through mass evangelism.\n\nTo put this into practice, CCC launched the “Ten Million National Evangelization Movement” in 1980, right after the political unrest of the previous year and the beginning of the Chun Doo-hwan regime. According to Kim, the country's political instability and moral decline were not primarily political or economic problems, but spiritual problems. In a famous address, he stated:\n\n“Evangelizing the nation is the highest form of patriotism. We must save souls to save Korea.”\n\nThe movement was not merely symbolic. CCC rapidly mobilized thousands of university students and lay Christians to spread the Gospel on campuses, in military barracks, and in neighborhoods across the country. It printed and distributed millions of evangelistic tracts, most notably the Four Spiritual Laws, a tool designed to present the Gospel in a simple, systematic format. Teams of students were trained to share their faith door-to-door, on public transportation, and at street corners. Mass events were held in auditoriums and stadiums to preach repentance and commitment to Christ.\n\nIn the early 1980s, CCC organized a series of “Holy Spirit Evangelization Conferences” in major cities like Seoul, Daejeon, and Busan, attracting tens of thousands of participants each time. The climax came in 1983, when CCC hosted the Explos ’83 World Evangelization Conference at Jamsil Olympic Stadium. With an estimated attendance of over 200,000 people, the event was the largest Christian revival rally in Korean history at that time. There, Kim proclaimed that Korea’s divine mission was not only to receive the Gospel, but to send it to the ends of the earth. One of the central declarations from the platform was:\n\n“Only a people armed with the Gospel can overcome communism.”\n\nAnother major pillar of CCC’s strategy was military evangelism. In a country where all male citizens were required to serve in the army, CCC saw the military as a powerful mission field. It trained chaplains and lay evangelists, held rallies in barracks, and handed out Gospel tracts to soldiers. The act of bringing young men to Christ during their service was framed as both a spiritual victory and a form of national defense.\n\nInternationally, CCC also developed a reverse mission strategy. Rather than only supporting Western missionaries coming into Korea, CCC envisioned Korean Christians taking the Gospel abroad—especially to the large diaspora communities in the United States, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Korean students were sent overseas during summer mission trips, not only to support churches but also to evangelize other Asian peoples as part of CCC’s vision for Korea as a “Gospel bridge” to the world.\n\nTo support and sustain this large-scale mobilization, CCC built a comprehensive discipleship training program. Students were enrolled in a four-stage progression: (1) Evangelism, (2) Maturity, (3) Commitment, and (4) Leadership. Bible studies, quiet time, and “one-to-one” mentoring formed the core of this system. By 1985, CCC reported that over 100,000 Korean students had completed some form of this training. Many of these individuals would go on to become pastors, missionaries, teachers, and even politicians and corporate leaders who carried CCC’s moral and spiritual values into other sectors of society.\n\nHowever, despite its immense scale and influence, CCC faced growing criticism for its silence on key issues of justice and oppression. It did not make any official statements or public actions regarding the Gwangju Uprising of 1980, in which hundreds of citizens were killed by military forces. Nor did CCC participate in campaigns addressing labor exploitation, the plight of factory workers, or the suppression of civil liberties. For many young activists and theologians, this lack of engagement with political and social realities made CCC appear not only apolitical, but potentially aligned with the status quo. Some scholars later argued that CCC’s focus on personal morality and national spiritual destiny led to an unintended complicity with the authoritarian regime of the 1980s, which welcomed religious groups that stayed away from political dissent.\n\nNonetheless, CCC’s legacy is significant. It created a mass movement of evangelism and discipleship among students and young adults, equipped hundreds of missionaries, and contributed to shaping Korea’s identity as one of the world’s most active missionary-sending countries. But it also left behind a theological question that still lingers: Can a faith that ignores injustice still claim to represent the whole Gospel?\n\n\nDemocratization Stream: KSCF, YMCA, YWCA, and Ecumenical Solidarity\n\nWhile the CCC led the evangelical wave of the 1980s, a distinct and deeply committed Christian student movement emerged in opposition to Korea’s military dictatorship. This movement was led by the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), in collaboration with urban YMCA branches, the YWCA, and Christian labor networks. These groups believed that Christianity could not be confined to private spirituality. For them, the Gospel demanded action in history—to stand with the oppressed, challenge unjust systems, and participate in national democratization.\n\nThe Gwangju Uprising in May 1980 became a defining event. As government troops massacred citizens protesting against Chun Doo-hwan’s illegitimate seizure of power, churches and major Christian organizations fell largely silent. But KSCF members, many of them students and youth leaders, could not remain passive. They interpreted the massacre as not just a political tragedy, but a theological crisis—a moment that forced Christians to choose between complicity and truth. In their public reflections, KSCF wrote: “To remember Gwangju is a matter of Christian conscience. The path to resurrection must pass through the cross of Gwangju.”\n\nAt a time when public gatherings were banned under Emergency Law No. 9, KSCF held clandestine prayer meetings and memorial services on university campuses and in affiliated churches. Students risked arrest by gathering to pray for the victims, to proclaim God’s justice, and to condemn violence as sin. Government authorities closely monitored these events, and in several cases, KSCF staff were detained or interrogated under the National Security Law. In response to the trauma of Gwangju and the wider social discontent, KSCF reorganized its activities toward what it called “theology on the ground.” In 1982, it formally launched the Student Social Development Corps (Haksa-dan)—a program where university students were sent not to conferences, but into the living conditions of the poor. Students moved into inner-city slums, lived with displaced communities in demolition zones, worked alongside factory laborers, and farmed with rural villagers. The aim was not to “help” the marginalized, but to learn from them what the Gospel truly meant. A former member recalled, “We stopped asking, ‘What is salvation?’ and started asking, ‘Where is Jesus suffering today?’”\n\nThis theology of presence and solidarity found institutional expression through the YMCA, particularly through student branches in universities. In 1983–84, Yonsei University YMCA launched the Namyangman Community Project, a bold initiative where students and local farmers formed intentional communities in rural areas. They worked together to plant rice, raise livestock, and run cooperatives, while holding Bible studies on economic justice and spiritual humility. Their belief was that “life in the countryside, rooted in community and simplicity, most closely resembles the Kingdom of God.” This project was not symbolic. Students physically relocated, committed to a rhythm of daily labor and shared faith, and documented the project as a model for Christian economic ethics.\n\nIn the cities, YWCA branches took on the struggle for women’s dignity and labor rights. The 1980s industrial boom had produced thousands of exploited female workers, many of them teenagers in sewing factories or electronics plants. The Seoul YWCA established labor counseling centers, where women could receive free legal assistance, attend rights education workshops, and find spiritual and emotional support. At the same time, Gwangju YWCA played a critical role during and after the Uprising. During the crackdown, it opened its facilities as shelters for injured citizens and fleeing students, defying martial law. In the following years, it became a site for trauma recovery programs, especially for women who had suffered loss or violence during the protests.\n\nAs the movement matured, it became more organized. By 1986, a nationwide Christian Young Workers' Movement, working closely with YMCA and KSCF, mobilized thousands of Christian workers and students. That year, over 3,000 participants joined a public demonstration in Seoul, calling for fair labor policies, union protection, and the moral responsibility of Christian citizens. At these gatherings, prayers were offered not just for spiritual renewal, but for a society free from corruption, injustice, and exploitation.\n\nThese actions represented more than just social concern. They embodied a theology rooted in minjung (people's) theology, liberation theology, and contextual Bible reading. Students were no longer reading Scripture in abstract—they read it in factories, protest sites, and villages. Christ was no longer found in the church building, but in the tear gas, the hunger strike, and the anonymous hands sewing clothes in midnight shifts.\n\n\nComparison and Intersection\n\nThe difference between CCC and KSCF was more than strategy—it reflected fundamentally different interpretations of the Gospel. CCC emphasized individual salvation and moral renewal, while KSCF and ecumenical groups emphasized collective liberation and public justice. CCC saw political engagement as a potential distraction from spiritual mission. KSCF saw political passivity as a betrayal of Christian faith. Despite these differences, there were occasional moments of interaction and dialogue. On some campuses, students from both groups joined in joint Bible studies and social ethics seminars hosted by local churches. A few pastors encouraged mutual understanding and communication, though such attempts remained limited and often fragile. Public perception of the two movements was also deeply divided. Conservative churches and mainstream media praised CCC for restoring moral discipline among youth, while labeling KSCF and its allies as left-leaning or radical. Meanwhile, democratization activists and international ecumenical groups recognized KSCF, YMCA, and YWCA as rare sanctuaries of free discourse and social imagination under dictatorship.\n\nUltimately, these diverging paths raised a central question for Korean Christianity: What is the role of faith in a society marked by authoritarianism, poverty, and division? Is the Gospel primarily about saving individual souls—or transforming unjust systems? For student Christians in the 1980s, this was not a theoretical question. It was a lived and often dangerous reality.\n\n\nConclusion: Between Gospel and Justice\n\nThe Christian student movements of the 1980s were not merely student ministry efforts. They represented a generation’s existential struggle over the meaning of faith in a time of national crisis. For CCC, faith meant passion for evangelism and a sense of patriotic spiritual calling. For KSCF, YMCA, and YWCA, faith demanded solidarity with the poor, prophetic resistance to injustice, and courage in the face of oppression.These two paths did not cancel each other out. Rather, they revealed the spiritual and theological breadth of Korean Protestantism. One stream deepened spiritual formation and missional fervor. The other widened the church’s ethical vision and social relevance. Looking back, they offer a mirror for today’s Christian community—a reminder that the Gospel can empower both personal transformation and collective liberation. The student movements of the 1980s continue to ask difficult questions: What does it mean to believe? Can prayer be protest? Can faith disturb injustice? These questions remain alive, urging new generations of Korean Christians to reflect, respond, and rediscover the Gospel in the world they inhabit.\n\nTable 13.

What began as suspicion and passive resistance in the 1970s gradually gave way to bold theological and practical engagement by the late 1980s. This shift was not incidental—it reflected deep theological convictions, historical responsibility, and a renewed understanding of the Church's role in society and mission.\n\n\nWhy Was Unification Important to the Korean Church?\n\nUnification was not merely a political concern for the Korean Church—it was fundamentally tied to its faith, identity, and mission:\n\nFaith Commitment: Unification as God’s Kingdom MovementUnification was seen as a tangible expression of the Kingdom of God on earth—a space where peace, justice, and reconciliation could be practiced in full.\n\n“Peaceful unification is a concrete manifestation of the Kingdom of God—where the strong and the weak live without discrimination and sing the song of hope.”\n\nHistorical ResponsibilityThe Church acknowledged its complicity in the past, especially its silence or alignment with Cold War anti-communism that had often reinforced the logic of division. Unification was thus a way to seek repentance and fulfill its ethical duty toward the nation.\n\n“Some Korean churches openly contributed to solidifying the division of the Korean peninsula by misunderstanding or even opposing God’s peace.”\n\nMissional Calling: Reconciliation and HealingParticipation in unification was part of God’s ongoing mission (Missio Dei), calling churches to act as agents of healing and reconciliation. This meant embracing both North and South as one people in need of restored communion.\n\nPreparing for Social IntegrationDrawing on lessons from German reunification, the Korean Church recognized that unification without social integration was incomplete. Churches needed to take the lead in building mutual understanding, addressing trauma, and offering models of reconciled community (Koinonia).\n\n“Even before political unification is achieved, the Church must live as a reconciled communion that anticipates the peace to come.”\n\nRestoring Fellowship with the Northern ChurchDecades of division had severed ties between churches in the South and Christians in the North. Reunification meant restoring this broken fellowship and renewing the spiritual bonds of one people under God.\n\n\nFrom Suspicion to Engagement\n\nThe immediate catalyst for change came in 1981, when news broke of a dialogue between North Korea’s Christian Federation and overseas Korean Christians, held under the title “Talks among Northern and Overseas Christians on National Reunification.” This meeting openly supported the 7.4 South-North Joint Statement and even discussed North Korea’s federal unification proposal. South Korean churches, initially shocked, began to reconsider their stance. According to historian Kim Heung-su:\n\n“The Korean churches, while opposing the dialogue itself, were influenced by it and began their own contact with the North’s Christian Federation during the 1980s.”\n\nThis shift culminated in 1988, when the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued the landmark “Declaration of the Korean Christian Churches on National Reunification and Peace.” This declaration officially accepted the core principles of the 7.4 Joint Statement—self-reliance, peaceful unification, and great national unity—and reframed unification as a matter of Christian justice and reconciliation.\n\n“Only in 1988 did the NCCK and its member denominations finally accept the 7.4 Joint Statement.”“National unification and peace are not merely political projects; they are grounded in the gospel message of reconciliation and justice.”\n\nAt the same time, theologians such as Lee Beom-seong and Shin Ok-soo developed a theology of peaceful unification, drawing from the experiences of German reunification and the concept of Missio Dei. They emphasized that the Church must fulfill both prophetic (preaching) and diaconal (service) roles.\n\n“Even if political unification has not yet occurred, the Korean Church must act now to embody reconciled communion (Koinonia).”\n\n\nDemocratization Movement\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Christianity in South Korea played a critical yet complex role in the nation’s democratization movement. Christian institutions, particularly progressive factions of Protestantism and the Catholic Church, became not only moral voices but also institutional bases for resistance. Their roles ranged from providing sanctuary for protestors to initiating transnational solidarity, while simultaneously revealing internal divisions, contradictions, and complicity in the era of rapid church growth.\n\nChristianity provided crucial organizational space and moral legitimacy for activists resisting authoritarianism. The Myeongdong Cathedral became a symbolic sanctuary, repeatedly sheltering student protesters and labor leaders. In the 1987 June Democratic Uprising, the cathedral served as the central sit-in site. As Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan famously stated in response to the state’s 1995 intrusion, “This is a desecration of the birthplace of the very government that now violates it”.\n\nProtestant organizations such as the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) and the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) played pivotal roles in the labor movement and in articulating a theology of resistance. The UIM, for instance, declared that “there can be no Kingdom of God on this earth where laborers are trampled” and established solidarity communities that bridged faith and class struggle.\n\nThe Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) emerged in direct response to the 1980 Gwangju Uprising. It declared, “Gwangju is the Cross of our nation,” and transformed grief into ritual resistance through annual memorial Masses and international advocacy. The group’s activities—ranging from exposing torture victims to issuing public denunciations—framed political resistance as an ethical duty of faith.\n\nChristian groups also enabled international communication. WCC (World Council of Churches) and affiliated ecumenical organizations in Germany and Japan provided platforms through which South Korean dissidents informed global audiences, lobbied for political prisoners, and received financial and moral support. As Misook Lee argues, this “transnational ecumenical network of communicative interaction” was crucial in circumventing domestic censorship.\n\nNevertheless, the relationship between Christianity and democratization was not unilaterally supportive. Evangelical megachurches and conservative denominations often remained silent or even cooperative with the authoritarian state. Jin-ho Kim refers to this as “anachronistic growth,” where the obsession with numerical expansion alienated Protestant churches from civil society and weakened public trust in religion.\n\nOrganizations like CCC (Campus Crusade for Christ) continued their mission of “Evangelizing the Nation, Unifying the Nation, Globalizing the Nation,” prioritizing large revival meetings over public engagement or critique of state violence. This divergence created clear ideological rifts between liberation theology–inspired movements and revivalist evangelicalism.\n\nDespite these tensions, international scholars affirm the significant role of Christianity in Korea’s democratic transition. Samuel Huntington described the churches as “the principal forum for opposition” in the 1980s, while Bruce Cumings emphasized their role as “sanctuaries immune from state intrusion”.\n\nIn sum, Christianity in 1980s South Korea occupied a paradoxical role—offering moral refuge and international solidarity on one hand, and ideological conflict and institutional ambivalence on the other. This dual nature reflected broader questions of what it meant to be the church in times of authoritarian crisis.\n\n\nTable 15.

Democratization has typically been viewed through the lens of political freedom and civil rights, while unification has been framed as an issue of diplomacy, security, and ideology. However, when examining the role of Christianity, it becomes clear that these two movements were deeply interconnected. The Church’s engagement in the democratization movement was an expression of its theological commitment to justice and human dignity, and its later turn toward the unification movement was a natural extension of that same moral responsibility—reaching beyond political change toward national reconciliation and healing.\n\nA unified narrative allows us to see that Korean Christianity was not merely reacting to historical events but actively envisioning a new social order grounded in faith. When democratization and unification are treated separately, the Church’s role appears fragmented; when they are integrated, we can better understand how theological themes such as the practice of justice and the proclamation of reconciliation were embodied in history. It reveals the Church not just as a political actor but as a community acting out of spiritual conviction and historical accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, writing a synthesis of democratization and unification movements is not only a matter of historical completeness—it is a necessary shift in perspective to grasp how faith communities responded holistically to the demands of their time. This integrated view challenges both the Church and civil society today to revisit the enduring questions of justice, peace, and communal life with renewed purpose.\n\n\nKorean Christian Diaspora and the Movements for Democracy and Reunification\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Korean Christian communities in Germany, Japan, and the United States emerged as moral voices of resistance, reconciliation, and justice. Their movements did not divide democracy from reunification, nor did they separate faith from action. Rather, they offered a theology practiced in prayer, protest, and deep international solidarity. These movements grew out of distinct contexts, but were united by one question: what does it mean to be the church in an age of dictatorship, division, and diaspora?\n\nThis essay deliberately does not draw a hard line between democratization movements and reunification movements among overseas Korean Christians. For those involved, the struggle against authoritarianism and the longing for national unity were not separate causes. Both were expressions of a deeper theological and ethical conviction—that justice could not stop at political reform, and peace could not be achieved without healing the division of the Korean people. As one pastor in Germany put it, “We could not preach democracy on Sunday and forget the pain of division on Monday.” The pursuit of democracy and the dream of reunification flowed together in their prayers, petitions, and public acts of conscience.\n\nBy organizing this narrative thematically rather than separating by region or political category, we uncover the transnational structure of Korean Christian activism in the diaspora: a structure held together by faith, memory, moral clarity, and shared vulnerability. The lines between protest and prayer, between theology and testimony, were intentionally blurred by those who believed that to follow Christ meant to stand with the oppressed—whether they lived under dictatorship or across a border sealed by war.\n\n\nGermany\n\nThe Korean Christian diaspora in West Germany emerged from a convergence of labor migration and theological reflection. Korean miners and nurses, sent under a bilateral labor agreement, found themselves immersed in German society while yearning for political change in Korea. Alongside them were theology students who saw the division of Korea and the repression of democracy as spiritual crises. Rev. Jang Sung-hwan, dispatched by the Korean National Council of Churches in 1972, quickly transformed his role from pastoral care to political education. In Bible studies, he taught labor law, human rights, and the theological meaning of resistance. “The gospel,” he preached, “is not an opiate—it is an alarm bell that wakes us to injustice.” When the Yushin Constitution was declared, Jang led protests in Bonn and was eventually denied access to some worker dormitories. One administrator told him, “You’re not just a pastor, you’re a threat.” To this, Jang replied, “Then I follow the same path as the prophets of old.” The May 1980 Gwangju Uprising shook the Korean communities in cities like Bochum and Heidelberg. One miner recalled, “We wept in the church basement all night. And in the morning, we began planning our protest.” These sentiments gave birth to the May People’s Festival in Europe, held annually since 1980. It became a site of liturgical resistance, combining poetry, lamentation, political education, and communal prayer. The theological framework for this movement was laid by Dr. Lee Young-bin, who proposed a “Third Space Theology” rooted in Karl Barth’s dialectical theology. “The church must not stand with the Right or the Left,” he wrote, “but where God stands—in reconciliation.” He founded the Korean Christian Overseas Reunification Association, one of the earliest efforts to promote direct dialogue between South and North Korean churches. “Faith,” Lee said, “must be a bridge across ideologies, not a wall behind which we hide.”\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nIn Japan, Korean Christians were not recent migrants but rather long-standing Zainichi residents—descendants of colonial laborers and settlers. Their faith emerged in the margins of Japanese society, shaped as much by ethnic discrimination as by spiritual conviction. The Korean Christian Church in Japan (KCCJ) provided not only worship but also a center for political and social advocacy. In 1970, when Korean youth Park Jong-seok was denied a job by Hitachi due to his nationality, Rev. Lee In-ha, pastor of a KCCJ church in Kawasaki, responded by organizing a support network. This movement eventually grew into the Network Against Ethnic Discrimination, which documented injustices and mobilized a broad coalition for civil rights. “To defend Park,” Lee said, “is to defend the image of God in every marginalized person.” In the 1980s, KCCJ collaborated with the National Christian Council of Japan (NCCJ) to oppose the fingerprinting of foreign residents. In 1985, churches across Kawasaki and Tokyo declared a “Korean Human Rights Sunday”, during which 12 Korean residents publicly refused fingerprinting in an act of civil disobedience. Their declaration was bold: “We are not criminals. We are children of God.” Beyond civil rights, the Japanese Christian network also played a pivotal role in North-South Korean dialogue. In 1984, the Tozanso Consultation marked the first postwar unofficial meeting of Christians from both Koreas, facilitated by Japanese churches. In 1986, at the Glion Meeting in Switzerland, South and North Korean church leaders shared communion. A KCCJ member later said, “We cried. Not because we agreed on politics, but because we remembered we were one in Christ.”\n\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Korean American Christian diaspora was socioeconomically diverse, including early immigrants, political refugees, and a rising generation of 1.5 and second-generation youth. But the Gwangju Massacre in 1980 became a spiritual turning point. Many Korean Americans who had remained silent now found their voice through their faith. Yoon Han-bong, a prominent Gwangju activist, arrived in Los Angeles after a dangerous escape from Korea. Instead of living quietly in exile, he founded Young Koreans United (YKU), a progressive Christian movement. He described it as “madang theology,” a courtyard theology rooted in community, activism, and reflection. “We do not gather to escape. We gather to act,” he said. YKU members lived in shared houses, organized political education programs, and launched campaigns for nuclear disarmament, North Korean human rights, and repatriation of unconverted prisoners. They also organized annual Gwangju commemorations, often inviting victim families and interfaith speakers. “Reunification,” one YKU pamphlet read, “is not a political slogan. It is a sacred promise—to mend what was broken, to return what was scattered.” The movement was grounded in churches. Thousands of Korean churches across the U.S. opened their spaces for prayer meetings and advocacy. In Los Angeles, the Thursday Prayer Meeting became a gathering where activism followed immediately after prayer. One young participant recalled, “We would pray with tears. And after the ‘Amen,’ someone would say, ‘Let’s write to our congressman.’ That’s what discipleship looked like.” YKU found broader support through the North America Human Rights Coalition (NHRK), which linked churches, NGOs, and U.S. policymakers. Their mission was clear: “Freedom is a God-given right. Gwangju is a global concern. The gospel does not remain silent.”\n\n\nDemocracy and Reunification as One Spiritual Calling\n\nIn all three regions, Korean Christians did not draw sharp lines between democratization and reunification. They understood both as parts of a larger divine mandate—a call to heal division and oppose injustice.\n\nIn Germany, Lee Young-bin asserted that “To speak of human rights without speaking of peace between North and South is to close one eye. The gospel sees with both eyes—truth and reconciliation.” In Japan, Lee In-ha proclaimed, “We are not simply Korean or Japanese citizens. We are watchmen for the marginalized across the world. Reunification is the cry of the displaced, and the hope of the divided.” And in America, Yoon Han-bong often reminded his followers: “We don’t want a democracy that ends at the DMZ. We want a Korea where no one is forgotten—north or south, past or present. This is not politics. This is justice. This is faith.” These weren’t slogans. They were radical reinterpretations of Korean Christianity itself. Through liturgy and organizing, protests and petitions, diaspora churches became laboratories for a faith that refused to be neutral in history.\n\n\nTable 16.

The rise of the Charismatic movement—emphasizing supernatural experiences such as speaking in tongues, healing, prophecy, and exorcism—provoked strong opposition from conservative theology. Two central figures shaped this confrontation: Pastor David Yonggi Cho of the Yoido Full Gospel Church, and Pastor Ki Dong Kim of Sungnak Church and the Berea Academy.\n\nPastor Cho emphasized the Pentecostal doctrine of the “Baptism of the Holy Spirit,” combined with his signature “Threefold Blessing”—salvation of soul, healing of the body, and material prosperity. He taught, “The gospel is not only about saving souls, but also healing diseases and liberating people from poverty”. His message resonated with a rapidly urbanizing and economically struggling population, helping the Yoido Full Gospel Church become the largest congregation in the world.\n\nIn contrast, Pastor Kim centered his ministry not only on spiritual gifts but on a unique theology of demon possession, the realm of the dead (Sheol), and angelic corruption. He argued, “Demons are the souls of deceased unbelievers, and even believers can be possessed”. He insisted that illnesses and life misfortunes result from demonic intrusion, and that only exorcism could solve them. He justified these teachings through thousands of cases he had allegedly experienced in ministry.\n\nConservative theologians responded strongly. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PROK) declared Pastor Cho’s theology “pseudo-Christian,” citing concerns over his Threefold Blessing and a controversial “resurrected maiden” testimony. However, Cho actively defended himself and clarified his doctrines. By 1993, the PROK lifted the heresy label after review. Cho’s theology remained within the bounds of orthodoxy, as he upheld traditional doctrines like the Trinity and salvation. In contrast, Pastor Kim faced a series of formal heresy verdicts from PROK, Hapdong, Koshin, and the Baptist Convention. His view that demons are souls of the dead clashed with biblical demonology, which traditionally identifies demons as fallen angels. His claim that “the entire world is Sheol, a place where these spirits roam,” was seen as a distortion of Christian eschatology.\n\nThis controversy revealed not merely doctrinal disagreements, but a deeper cultural-theological divide. Conservative theology, grounded in systematic exegesis and Reformed orthodoxy, values order, liturgy, and objective scriptural authority. The Charismatic movement, by contrast, emphasized experiential faith, direct emotional encounter with the Holy Spirit, and practical results such as healing and financial blessings.\n\nKim’s theology went further: he linked demons to physical illness, suicide, addiction, and mental distress, and taught that exorcism was necessary for deliverance. “Demons, as the spirits of unbelievers, wander the earth until their natural lifespan is completed,” he claimed. “They cause all misfortunes, and must be driven out through spiritual warfare”. For many conservative theologians, this resembled shamanism cloaked in Christian terminology. Cho, on the other hand, avoided explicit doctrinal conflict. Though criticized for emphasizing blessing and prosperity, he did not promote doctrinal deviations. He maintained ongoing dialogue with denominations and steered the Yoido church toward global evangelical legitimacy, eventually chairing the World Assemblies of God Fellowship (WAGF).\n\nFrom 1985 onward, Kim was officially condemned as a heretic by most major denominations in Korea. He separated from the institutional church, establishing Sungnak Church as an independent body and rejecting dialogue. His theology was never reconciled with Protestant orthodoxy. Cho, in contrast, re-engaged with the institutional church, clarified his teachings, and had the pseudo-Christian label lifted. His church became a model for global charismatic growth, especially among non-Western churches.\n\n\nTable 18.

The founders, including physicist Kim Young-gil, envisioned creation science as an apologetic alternative to evolutionary biology. They emphasized “scientific evidence” for a literal reading of Genesis, and Kim declared, “The Bible is the true science textbook”​. The KACR's publications, such as Is Evolution Scientific Fact? (1981), quickly spread through churches and student ministries. By the 1990s, creationism had become mainstream within Korean evangelical circles. KACR expanded its influence through public lectures, textbooks like 창조론 대강좌 (1996), and science-themed exhibitions. The creation science exhibit at KAIST, established in 1993, stood as a symbolic validation of their scientific credibility​. Yet their approach remained focused on young-earth creationism (YEC) and a singular global flood model, resisting broader academic critique.\n\nA major turning point occurred when Professor Yang Seung-hoon—a prominent KACR member—began to adopt a position closer to old-earth, multi-catastrophe creationism. In 2006, he published Creation and Catastrophe and asked his publisher to withdraw his previous YEC textbook from circulation. Yang stated, “Young-earth creationism is certainly wrong; I see no need to cling to it anymore”​. This shift, initially overlooked by KACR leadership, soon triggered institutional rupture.\n\nIn 2007, Yang and theologian Cho Deok-young launched the Open Forum for Creationists to foster pluralistic dialogue among Christians interested in creation. Its motto welcomed “anyone with an open mind toward different theological and scientific interpretations of creation”. The forum hosted academic symposia and published nearly 200 articles from 2007 to 2017. Topics included intelligent design, old-earth models, and critiques of YEC. This marked a decisive shift from popular apologetics to scholarly engagement. However, the forum’s pluralism provoked backlash. In 2008, KACR formally expelled Yang Seung-hoon for promoting old-earth views. Their justification cited over 30 non-peer-reviewed sources and was led by a faculty member in web design, not geology. Even CCC founder Kim Joon-gon, who had supported KACR since its inception, called Yang directly to request he shut down the Open Forum—an appeal Yang respectfully declined.\n\nMeanwhile, the rise of theistic evolution further diversified Korea’s evangelical discourse. Figures like Woo Jong-hak and Choi Seung-eon, both physicists trained in the U.S., publicly challenged YEC. Woo founded Dialogue Between Science and Theology (과신대) and gained traction among younger Christians via social media. His proposed lectures were repeatedly canceled by conservative institutions, including Handong University and Chongshin University, due to theological backlash.\n\nThe conflict reached the public sphere in 2012, when the Society for Textbook Revise (STR)—an offshoot of KACR—successfully petitioned the Ministry of Education to remove references to Archaeopteryx and horse evolution from high school science textbooks. The ministry did not consult scientific experts and merely relayed the petition to publishers, many of whom complied. Evolutionary biologist Jang Dae-kyung lamented, “There are only 5–10 evolutionary scientists in the country… the scientific community has done little to resist”​. This moment marked global embarrassment. Nature and Scientific American ran critical features, warning that Korea had surrendered to pseudoscience in a way unmatched even in the U.S.. The backlash prompted some officials to reverse the decision later that year. Then, in 2017, under President Moon Jae-in, the nomination of Park Seong-jin—a KACR board member—for Small and Medium Business Minister sparked national uproar. In a confirmation hearing, Park claimed, “The age of the Earth differs between science and faith,” and acknowledged belief in a 6,000-year-old Earth \"in church\" while accepting older ages “scientifically.” This dual-language undermined his credibility, and he withdrew within weeks. After Park's resignation, KACR saw a decline in young scholars' participation. According to internal sources, even co-authoring a paper with creationists became politically risky. The momentum of the movement, once buoyed by mass appeal and church support, was now facing institutional and cultural marginalization.\n\n\nContemporary Christian Music (CCM) Movement\n\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) movement in South Korea marked not merely the introduction of a new genre but a transformational shift in the form of worship, spiritual expression, and the church’s engagement with youth and culture. Praise teams emerged as a key force driving the transition from traditional, choir-led services to participatory, emotion-centered worship that resonated deeply with modern sensibilities. In contrast to many Western churches, Korean churches saw this transformation spread rapidly and broadly, due to structural, cultural, and socio-political conditions unique to Korea during this era.\n\nAmong the leading figures of this transformation was Choi Deok-sin, who founded Joochan-yang Missionary Group in 1981 and began composing CCM pieces that blended modern musical techniques with deeply theological messages. His iconic song “His Name”, based on a poem by Song Myung-hee and released in 1985, sold over 300,000 copies—an unprecedented achievement that helped shift Christian music from the category of gospel songs to an emerging identity as CCM. The piece used suspended chords (sus4, sus9), syncopation, dotted rhythms, and triplets—harmonic elements rarely seen in earlier Korean Christian music—to convey what he called “the awe and mystery of Jesus”. Choi was not only a composer but also served as a producer, mentoring and producing albums for later CCM artists such as Park Jong-ho, Song Jung-mi, and Choi In-hyuk. His contribution to the sonic and aesthetic framework of Korean CCM positions him as a “producer of worship culture” rather than a mere musician.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the emergence of the Praise & Worship movement through the influence of international worship ministries such as the UK’s Praise & Worship series. Ha Yong-in (Hasdeban) played a key role in introducing this style in 1987, and the Duranno Thursday Praise gatherings institutionalized a “celebratory” model of worship that included drums, synthesizers, and even liturgical dance. “The shift to celebratory worship was a revolution,” writes one researcher, “especially in a time when preaching had been the entirety of worship”. “Jesus Abbey and Youth With A Mission (YWAM) helped lead the praise gatherings in Korea that adapted the structure and spirit of Vineyard-style worship”.\n\nChristian broadcasting played a vital role in the spread and popularization of CCM. Stations like CBS and Far East Broadcasting Company aired programs such as Gospel Hour, Songs of Peace and Love, and Truly Joyful Songs, introducing both domestic and international CCM to broader audiences. Gospel Hour, hosted by singer-songwriter Ha Deok-kyu in 1989, became a milestone for CCM’s nationwide dissemination.\n\nCCM was not limited to musical aesthetics—it also became a key part of Korea’s Christian movements in the 1980s, connecting deeply with spiritual and social agendas such as reunification prayer meetings, healing ministries, and youth revival camps. Worship teams were central to these gatherings, fostering communal emotion and theological reflection through song.\n\nA representative piece is Koh Hyung-won’s “As the Waters Cover the Sea,” a praise anthem whose repeated declaration—“The knowledge of the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea”—helped unite congregants in corporate hope and mission. Another major figure was Kim Do-hyun, who carried the legacy of 1980s CCM aesthetics into the 2000s with fresh innovation. His hit “The Holy Spirit Has Come” integrated blues harmonies and rich harmonic tensions, expanding the musical vocabulary of Korean worship music. His albums were structured as narrative works with theological and healing themes, such as his collaboration with filmmaker Kim Woo-hyun on the documentary Beatitudes.\n\nThe 1980s was also a time of domestication of imported gospel music. Korean composers like Kim Suk-kyun, Joo Sook-il, and Kim Min-sik began producing original works infused with Korean emotional sensibilities and spiritual themes. These works helped transform imported gospel into a contextualized, indigenous expression of Korean Christianity.\n\nTherefore, this decade should be understood not as a period of mere musical introduction but as the formative era of Korean CCM. Four key features emerged: (1) the establishment of CCM as a distinct genre; (2) the shift from traditional choir worship to participatory praise; (3) the rise of artist-led production and distribution; and (4) the use of CCM as a strategic tool for cultural evangelism and youth ministry. This foundation laid the groundwork for the 1990s industrialization of worship, concert-style services, and the global export of Korean CCM. Ultimately, CCM in 1980s Korea became both “an art that structures worship” and “a cultural vehicle for experiencing the Gospel.” It redefined how churches engaged with society, and how believers expressed their faith—with beauty, passion, and sound.\n\n ",
