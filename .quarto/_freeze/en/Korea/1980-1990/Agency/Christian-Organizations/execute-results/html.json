Citizens’ rights and the livelihoods of the working poor were often sacrificed in the name of national security and economic growth. In this context, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) emerged not just as an ecumenical body of denominations, but as a prophetic actor in the fields of democratization, human rights, and reunification.\n\nIn 1983, the NCCK made a bold public theological statement, declaring that the division of the Korean peninsula was not merely a geopolitical or political issue but a matter of Christian faith.\n\n“Division is the root of poverty, dictatorship, and the threat of nuclear war. Overcoming division is the very act of living out our faith.” This declaration was groundbreaking. At the time, public discourse about reunification was often treated as subversive or pro-North Korean. By claiming that the issue was central to Christian mission, NCCK gave churches a theological rationale for public engagement in peace and unification.\n\nThis theological conviction translated into action. In 1986, representatives from NCCK and the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) of North Korea held an unofficial civil-level dialogue in Glion, Switzerland, marking the first meeting between Protestant representatives from both Koreas outside of governmental control.\n\n“The Glion Meeting marked a historic turning point where North and South Korean Christians, beyond ideology and borders, sought a vision of national reconciliation.” Between 1986 and 1988, three such meetings were held. These meetings demonstrated that the churches of North and South could form bonds based on shared faith, even in a deeply divided land.\n\nOne theological bridge between NCCK and its North Korean counterparts lay in the convergence of Minjung theology and Juche ideology. “Minjung theology and Juche thought both placed the oppressed people or ‘masses’ at the center of history, opening a space for meaningful inter-ideological dialogue.” Minjung theology, rooted in Korean struggles, declared that Jesus is present among the suffering people and that faith must be enacted in solidarity with the oppressed. This made inter-Korean dialogue a matter of Christian vocation.\n\nSuch moves, however, provoked state repression. In 1985, when the NCCK attempted to hold a church-led national reunification conference, the government banned it under the National Security Law. In response, the NCCK released a public statement outlining its “Three Principles for Reunification”:\n\nReunification is not the sole task of the state—it is the responsibility of all citizens.\n\nBoth regimes must not use division as a tool for preserving power.\n\nChristians have both the freedom and responsibility to engage in reunification efforts.\n\nThis declaration challenged the government’s monopoly over national identity, insisting that faith-based civil society had a legitimate voice in political life.\n\nWhat enabled NCCK to sustain such prophetic activities, despite pressure and surveillance, was its deep connection with the global ecumenical movement. Churches in West Germany, the World Council of Churches (WCC), and Christian Aid provided financial and moral support. In 1978, NCCK’s total annual income reached 158.46 million KRW, of which over 110.57 million KRW (about 70%) came from foreign church grants. Major contributors included BfW (49.9%), WCC (21%), Christian Aid, ICCO, and NCCUSA. These funds empowered NCCK to maintain its independence and pursue social justice initiatives.\n\nThe aid wasn’t limited to declarations. It funded on-the-ground projects for marginalized populations. In 1972, Brot für die Welt (BfW) signed a formal agreement to support urban mission work in Korea through Project P1732, contributing 203,000 Deutsche Marks. These funds enabled NCCK to support poor urban communities, displaced workers, and emerging grassroots activists.\n\nA particularly important figure in mobilizing global support was Oh Jae-shik, who served in WCC and CCA urban mission bodies. Through his efforts, the WCC URM budget expanded from $5,000 to $2 million. Half of that budget was designated for Asia, and $500,000 was directed to Korean projects, including:\n\nindustrial mission centers\n\nliving expenses for dismissed professors\n\naid for families of political prisoners\n\npublication of the progressive magazine Mal\n\nfounding of environmental justice institutes\n\n“Much of the $500,000 raised by Oh Jae-shik was used to support Korea’s urban industrial mission, dismissed professors, and political prisoners' families.”⁷ These efforts transformed NCCK into a channel for international pressure against authoritarianism and a conduit for civil society building in Korea.\n\nInternally, NCCK’s activism also reshaped Korean Christian theology. Thinkers like Jürgen Moltmann (Theology of Hope), Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Theology of Resistance), and the Barmen Declaration from Germany influenced Korean theologians. These ideas merged with Minjung theology, helping to formulate the belief that \"human rights activism is itself Christian mission.\"\n\n“The courage and faith of the Korean church under severe repression moved many in the German churches. We Christians have much to learn from them.” — Testimony of Dorothea Schweitzer\n\nIn conclusion, the NCCK of the 1980s stood as more than an ecclesiastical institution. It became a faith-based agent of social transformation, embodying what it meant to resist dictatorship, heal national division, and stand with the suffering. Its work offers a model of how religion, when rooted in solidarity and justice, can challenge the powers of its time and offer hope to a broken nation.\n\n\nTable 12.

Under the leadership of Rev. Kim Joon-gon, CCC transitioned from a campus-focused ministry to one that envisioned evangelizing the entire nation and sending missionaries across the globe. This vision was actualized through a multi-layered strategy that encompassed personal evangelism, systematic discipleship training, international missions, and cultural ministries.\n\nOne of CCC’s most well-known methods was personal evangelism using gospel tracts, particularly the Four Spiritual Laws. CCC staff and student leaders frequently visited campuses to conduct one-on-one evangelism, explaining salvation through a concise four-point structure: God’s plan, humanity’s sin, Jesus’ sacrifice, and salvation through faith. This approach quickly became a model for campus evangelism nationwide and was recognized for its systematic and scalable format​.\n\nFollowing evangelism, CCC implemented a rigorous, multi-stage discipleship training system. The training followed a five-step trajectory: personal nurturing → basic cell groups (순모임) → discipleship training → leadership training → mission sending. Small group Bible studies, quiet time practices, and prayer meetings were conducted under the supervision of campus staff and student leaders (순장). These structured programs not only deepened spiritual formation but also influenced lay leadership training programs in many Korean churches​.\n\nDuring this decade, CCC organized massive nationwide revival and training events such as the National Evangelization Leadership Training Conferences, Explo ’74, and the 1980 World Evangelization Convention. These events combined mass worship with residential evangelism training, in which ordinary students were trained as evangelists and small group Bible study leaders through an intensive living and learning experience. These students were then dispatched to churches and campuses across the country. Kim Joon-gon proclaimed this as a movement “to revolutionize the nation through the gospel, mobilizing two million Christians”​.\n\nCCC also expanded into overseas missions during the 1980s. The organization began organizing short-term mission trips to countries such as the Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan, and later started deploying long-term missionaries. In the 1990s, CCC launched “New Life 2000,” a major overseas outreach project that involved sending mission teams and church planters abroad. Along with training during retreats, CCC aligned with international evangelical conferences and developed a long-term missionary sending infrastructure​.\n\nCCC’s cultural ministry also flourished in the 1980s. The group formed over a dozen gospel music teams—including Good Life and Crossroads—which performed domestically and internationally as part of its praise evangelism strategy. CCC also dubbed the internationally renowned JESUS film into Korean and established an audiovisual department to support film-based evangelism. In 1989, the professional praise team Mobil was formed, elevating CCC's presence in Christian media and culture​.\n\nThrough these activities, CCC became more than a campus ministry—it emerged as the flagship of conservative evangelical student movements in South Korea. However, its emphasis on national revival and its cooperative stance with authoritarian governments drew criticism from progressive Christian student groups like KSCF, who saw CCC’s message as politically conservative and disconnected from the suffering of marginalized groups. Nevertheless, CCC’s well-organized strategies, training models, and cultural productions significantly shaped the trajectory of Korean Protestantism. Many of CCC’s alumni went on to become prominent pastors, missionaries, and leaders in church and society​.\n\n\nKorean Student Christian Federation (KSF) 한국기독학생회총연맹 \n\nThe 1980s was a turbulent decade in South Korea, marked by authoritarian rule, state violence, and widespread social unrest. In this context, the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), a progressive ecumenical Christian student movement, played a significant role in linking Christian faith to the people’s struggle for democracy and justice.\n\nOne of the most defining events for KSCF in this decade was the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980, when government troops brutally suppressed pro-democracy protesters. For many Christian students, the massacre in Gwangju became a moment of spiritual and political awakening. KSCF interpreted the uprising not only as a political tragedy but as a call for prophetic Christian action. According to internal testimonies, \"telling the truth about Gwangju was itself an act of faith.\" KSCF organized Bible studies and memorial services to reflect on the event theologically, often under government surveillance. These activities positioned the group as a rare voice of moral resistance within the student and church communities.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the authoritarian regime banned or tightly regulated student unions and organizations. KSCF responded by revitalizing its grassroots student base through alternative networks. A major initiative was the expansion of the Haksadan (Student Social Development Unit). Through this program, KSCF students immersed themselves in marginalized communities. For instance, Yonsei University students engaged with displaced urban poor in the Yeonhui-dong apartment district; Korea University students worked in the polluted industrial zone of Jongam-dong; and Kyung Hee University students investigated social conditions in the slums along Cheonggyecheon stream. These on-the-ground experiences were not just community service but were framed as acts of discipleship, intended to align Christian practice with Jesus' solidarity with the oppressed.\n\nIn addition, KSCF’s commitment to critical theology led it to adopt and reinterpret minjung theology, a Korean contextual theology that identifies the \"minjung\" (the oppressed masses) as the primary subject of God’s redemptive work. Bible reading and worship became tools for social awareness. KSCF facilitated nationwide Bible study campaigns, emphasizing stories of the Hebrew exodus and Jesus’ ministry among the poor. These studies inspired many students to consider their faith in terms of justice, liberation, and structural change. One student from this era recalled, \"Our Bible study on Exodus gave us the courage to speak out against dictatorship and to act in solidarity with laborers and farmers.\"\n\nKSCF also attempted to rebuild student associations that had been disbanded by the military regime. After the government loosened some restrictions in 1983, KSCF members on several campuses helped reestablish full-fledged student councils by 1984. This reorganization enabled Christian students to publicly engage in university reform, human rights advocacy, and anti-war protests alongside secular student groups. Despite pressure from both the state and conservative church circles, KSCF persisted in acting as a bridge between the church and democratization movements.\n\nThe group, however, faced internal tensions. Some members, influenced by Marxist analysis, questioned whether Christian faith was compatible with revolutionary activism. Others remained committed to the unique value of theological critique. This ideological tension sometimes led to fragmentation. Yet, many within KSCF sought to synthesize faith and action, claiming that \"revolution without faith becomes ideology, and faith without justice becomes hypocrisy.\"\n\nKSCF’s work had far-reaching effects. Within the church, it challenged traditional youth ministries and inspired local congregations to rethink their role in society. Outside the church, its public witness helped to counter the dominant image of Christianity as an ally of the military regime. Many KSCF alumni went on to become leaders in NGOs, labor unions, human rights organizations, and peace movements.\n\nIn sum, the Korea Student Christian Federation in the 1980s modeled a theology that was both reflective and revolutionary. Grounded in scripture, committed to justice, and incarnated in the lives of the oppressed, KSCF embodied a form of discipleship that refused to separate faith from history. Through protests, prayer vigils, Bible studies, and grassroots organizing, it shaped a generation of Christian activists who carried their vision well beyond campus walls.\n\n\nYMCA \n\n\nThe 1980s was a period of dramatic transformation for the Korean YMCA, especially in cities like Seoul and Gwangju, where the organization emerged as a visible and trusted actor in South Korea’s democratization and civil society movements. Though originally formed as a Christian youth service organization, the YMCA began to redefine itself as a movement grounded in people-centered theology, democratic engagement, and local empowerment.\n\nOne of the most powerful examples of this shift occurred during the May 18 Gwangju Uprising in 1980, when citizens in the southwestern city of Gwangju rose up against the newly installed military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan. The uprising was met with extreme military violence, leaving hundreds dead. In the midst of this crisis, the Gwangju YMCA opened its auditorium and meeting rooms to citizen leaders, grieving families, and prayer gatherings. When martial law banned all public meetings, “the YMCA auditorium on Geumnam-ro remained the only place where prayers for justice could be spoken aloud.” YMCA leaders also participated in citizen mediation efforts and preserved testimonies of the massacre, even as the central YMCA leadership avoided direct political confrontation.\n\nIn Seoul, the Yonsei University YMCA (SCA) was expanding its vision of Christian discipleship through immersion-based ministry. In 1982, 39 students were sent into Korea’s most marginalized areas, including the Nanjido landfill (a massive garbage mountain), leprosy colonies, and the Pulmuwon farming cooperative. These student volunteers did not visit briefly—they lived alongside the residents, sharing meals and daily labor. One participant recalled, “Living in the community became a form of spiritual formation, where we interpreted the suffering of the poor through the lens of faith.”\n\nThis theology of incarnation and resistance led to further experimentation. In 1983 and 1984, students from the Yonsei SCA launched a rural cooperative experiment in the Namyangman region, promoting collective farming, economic self-reliance, and Christian community. “The Namyangman project was not about charity,” a leader explained, “but about modeling an alternative society grounded in cooperation, reflection, and faith.”\n\nThis work was sustained by intellectual formation. Yonsei YMCA initiated the Nuruk Bible School and hosted a series of lectures by leading Christian thinkers such as Ham Seok-heon, Jang Il-jo, and Kim Jae-joon, addressing topics like Marxism, revolution, and technocracy. These conversations reflected a yearning among students to build a “Christian language that could make sense of injustice, exploitation, and dictatorship.”\n\nWhile these activities were rooted in faith, they also reshaped public life. Many Yonsei SCA alumni went on to lead YMCA branches across the country—in Seoul, Incheon, Busan, Daejeon, and Daegu—spreading a model of socially engaged Christianity grounded in civil society leadership. “Many SCA graduates became YMCA leaders across the country and shaped Korea’s faith-based civic culture.”\n\nTheologically and institutionally, the 1980s was also the decade in which the Korean YMCA formally embraced its activist identity. In 1976, it had already revised its mission statement, inspired by the World YMCA’s Kampala Declaration, which called for democratization, economic justice, and people-centered development. By the early 1980s, YMCA leaders like Kang Moon-kyu spoke openly about the need to serve not just the young, but the “suffering people (minjung),” redefining YMCA as a “functional church”—a church in movement and solidarity.”\n\nBy the end of the decade, YMCA had become one of Korea’s most respected civil organizations, engaging in campaigns for labor rights, environmental sustainability, and community-based economic justice. Its prayer meetings became protests, and its service programs became political testimonies—making the 1980s a defining chapter in the re-Christianization of Korea’s civic space.\n\n\nYWCA\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Korean YWCA emerged as one of the few Christian organizations where women could engage in faith-based activism at the intersection of gender justice, democracy, and daily survival. While its national office maintained a cautious stance under authoritarian rule, many local YWCA chapters developed a bold and practical theology grounded in the lived experiences of working-class women.\n\nThe most dramatic episode unfolded in Gwangju during the May 18 Uprising of 1980, when citizens resisted the military coup led by Chun Doo-hwan. As troops opened fire on unarmed civilians, local churches and organizations were paralyzed by fear or shut down entirely. But the Gwangju YWCA remained open, providing space for prayer, rest, and strategic discussion among community members. According to one researcher, “YWCA leaders participated in the citizens’ mediation committee and supported post-trauma healing for women and youth in the wake of the massacre.” Though the national YWCA could not issue public statements, these local actions spoke powerfully to the organization’s rootedness in community care and justice.\n\nIn Seoul and other urban centers, the YWCA addressed a different kind of crisis: the everyday injustice faced by women workers. The 1980s marked a period of explosive industrialization in South Korea, during which many women found work in factories under exploitative conditions. In response, YWCA programs focused on vocational training, legal rights education, and occupational safety for working-class women. One staff member recalled, “We were not theologians; we were Christian women in the field, struggling to bring prayer and protest together.”\n\nIn 1985, the Seoul YWCA launched its Women’s Labor Counseling Center, where factory workers—many in their teens and early twenties—could seek help for wage theft, sexual harassment, and industrial injuries. These services were often delivered by volunteers trained in both legal literacy and Christian counseling. Through this work, the YWCA built a new model of Christian service: not charitable aid, but solidarity rooted in shared faith and feminist consciousness.\n\nAs part of its theological formation, YWCA organized a range of public education programs such as the “Wednesday Lecture Series” and “Minjung Women’s Roundtables.” These events explored the role of women in democratization, theology, and social transformation. For example, one roundtable in Gwangju brought together theologians, farmers, labor activists, and survivors of political violence to ask: How can Christian women respond to injustice not only with compassion but with collective power?\n\nAlthough not directly aligned with liberation theology or the minjung theology movement, the YWCA articulated what some scholars have called a “praxis-based Christian feminism.” This approach emphasized incarnation, service, and justice over ideological dogma. It grounded its theology not in abstract doctrine but in the realities of domestic violence, unequal labor, and silenced voices. As one participant put it, “We found Christ in the sewing machines, in the strike shelters, and in the tears of single mothers.”\n\nThe impact of the 1980s YWCA extended both within and beyond the church. Inside the church, it created space for laywomen’s leadership and challenged male-dominated authority structures. Outside the church, it trained a generation of Christian women activists who would go on to found NGOs, join peace movements, and influence public policy. In doing so, YWCA redefined what it meant to be a faithful Christian woman in an age of rapid change and deep injustice.\n\n\nNCC Thursday Prayer Meetings\n\n\nThis Meeting began in the midst of the authoritarian Yushin regime in the 1970s and grew throughout the 1980s into a space of solidarity and resistance—a living embodiment of Korean Christianity’s faith-in-action during times of suffering.\n\nThe prayer meetings began on July 18, 1974, as a response to widespread arrests under the Yushin regime’s emergency decrees. Countless student activists and democracy advocates were imprisoned, and many Christian pastors felt compelled to respond. Leaders from the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)—including Kim Sang-geun, Lee Hae-dong, and Moon Dong-hwan—gathered regularly with families of detainees at the Christian Building in Jongno, Seoul, for what they called the “Regular Thursday Prayer Meeting with the Incarcerated.” Over time, it expanded into the “Regular Thursday Prayer Meeting for the Realization of Justice and Freedom.” On April 10, 1975, the day after the rushed executions of eight individuals connected to the Inhyeokdang case, prayer meeting attendees rushed to the mortuary and were forcibly detained by police while trying to prevent the seizure of the victims’ bodies. This incident made clear that the Thursday gatherings were not just religious rituals—they were public acts of protest against state violence.\n\nAs the years passed, the themes and scope of the meetings grew. From 1977, the voices of workers suffering from exploitation and dismissal began to take center stage. Meetings featured handwritten petitions and appeals from women laborers at factories such as Banglim Spinning and Samgosa. These events marked the expansion of the prayer meeting from a focus on students and political dissidents to a broader platform that included workers and farmers as well.At the July 22, 1977 prayer meeting, a young worker named Kim Il-sim, who had been harassed and relocated for attending the Christian Industrial Mission, read a heartfelt statement: “Is it really such a crime to attend the Industrial Mission? I’ve done nothing wrong except ask for my rightful overtime pay and join a church group that prays for workers like me.” These testimonies reveal how the prayer meetings became not only a space for elite or student dissidents, but also a platform for the working poor to speak their truth.\n\nThese developments brought greater surveillance and violence. On September 22, 1979, during a special prayer meeting for dismissed workers from Dongil Spinning attended by over 500 people, plainclothes officers stormed the building and brutally beat participants. The incident became known as the “9/22 Christian Building Incident.” Police attacked pastors, women, students, and workers alike. One woman was dragged down the stairs by her hair. Another female student was kicked in the chest. Pastor Cho Hwa-soon was beaten unconscious and carried away in a police van. Despite dozens being detained, the Friday prayer meetings did not stop; rather, they gained renewed urgency and attention.\n\nThe early 1980s marked a period of darkness. Following the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, the newly entrenched military regime further clamped down. The prayer meetings could no longer be held openly and were replaced by visits to detainees’ families and small, private worship services. But on February 11, 1982, they resumed under the new name: “Thursday Worship with Those Who Suffer.” These services took place twice a month and continued to highlight state abuses. For example, in April 1983, after reports emerged of students being beaten en masse at Seodaemun Detention Center, the prayer meeting became a site for public denunciations, with families reading petitions and protest letters. NCC leaders even visited the Ministry of Justice, calling for an independent investigation. This showed that the prayer meetings were not merely spiritual gatherings but an active platform for human rights advocacy and action.\n\nIn May 1984, the prayer meetings regained their weekly format and began a new phase of growth. Attendance surged, and speakers from a wide range of denominations, regions, and professions joined the pulpit. Among them, Pastor Park Hyung-kyu delivered more than ten sermons during the 1980s and was arrested after offering a benediction on October 30, 1986. These years saw the meetings serve as a sanctuary and stage for victims of the Gwangju Uprising, families of political prisoners, workers suffering from unpaid wages, and others in the margins. The meetings cultivated solidarity and a spirit of shared resistance among churches, advocacy organizations, and civil society.\n\nThe meetings also had a global reach. Korean diasporic communities in Los Angeles, New York, Germany, and Canada held Thursday Prayer Meetings in solidarity, publishing updates in human rights newsletters and staging their own protests. In 1985, a solidarity prayer meeting was held in New York for the Dongil Spinning workers, involving both Korean-Americans and members of the global ecumenical movement. This demonstrated that the meetings were not confined to Korea—they had become a node in the worldwide Christian struggle for justice and human dignity.\n\nUltimately, the NCC Thursday Prayer Meetings were far more than a church ritual. They were sacred spaces of lament, hope, and protest, where Christian faith confronted authoritarianism head-on. Through them, the tears of the suffering were transformed into shared cries for justice. Those who read prayers, wept for the detained, or were arrested for offering sermons stood together—not as political actors alone, but as the body of Christ seeking God's justice and mercy in a broken society.\n\n\nKorean Diakonia Sisterhood\n\n\nOne of the most distinctive identities of the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood lies in its embodiment of a “Protestant monastic community.” Traditionally, the concept of a monastery in Korean society has been associated exclusively with Catholicism. However, the Diakonia Sisterhood challenged this assumption and opened up an entirely new possibility for a monastic life rooted in Protestant theology. They neither wore habits nor took lifelong vows, but they established communal rules and lived a daily rhythm of prayer, work, and learning—embodying a monastic way of life in every sense.\n\nTheir life was “not a cloistered withdrawal but a monastic practice of prayer and service within the reality of everyday life.” One sister recalled, “We had no habits, and we didn’t take lifelong vows like in traditional orders, but our life was monastic in every way. We prayed, worked, ate together, and started and ended each day with Scripture and sharing.”\n\nThis Protestant monastic spirituality aimed at “living a contemplative life within daily activities.” As one scholar described, “Their spirituality was a Martha-like mode of life, where contemplative silence and active service were seamlessly integrated.” In this way, the sisters lived out God's will through both silence and action: tending to the sick, working in the fields, and revitalizing the village community. Their daily rhythm made no distinction between prayer and work. “The Sisterhood prayed while working and worked while praying. It was a new form of monastery that experienced God’s presence not behind walls, but in the midst of the world.”\n\nThe community's spiritual foundation drew from Lutheran monastic traditions, Bonhoeffer’s Life Together, and the practical demands of Minjung theology. Deeply influenced by Bonhoeffer, they demonstrated “that Protestants, too, could live a monastic life in real practice.” Ahn Byung-mu notably encouraged women “to break free from the confines of marriage and domestic labor, to embrace celibacy as a theological choice, and to live a monastic life in solidarity with the oppressed.”In this sense, the Diakonia Sisterhood’s significance lies in how it “redefined the model of a traditional monastery and proposed a new vision of monastic life possible even within Protestantism.”\n\n\nDemocratic Society Construction Council (Minjon)\n\n\nThe Democratic Society Construction Council (Minjon), active in Germany, was officially established on March 1, 1974, following an anti-Yushin dictatorship rally held at Beethoven Square in Bonn. This gathering went beyond a mere statement against the Yushin regime—it was a declaration of intent to launch a full-fledged democratization movement. At the event, participants read aloud the “Declaration for the Construction of a Democratic Society,” signaling organized resistance to the regime. The statement proclaimed, “In solidarity with the Korean people’s struggle to reclaim freedom and human dignity under the oppression and fear of the Yushin system, we will continue our efforts here in Germany to build a democratic society”.\n\nThe council brought together Koreans from diverse social backgrounds in Germany—students, miners, nurses, and religious workers—forming a rare coalition. According to early membership records, about 45.5% were students, with the remainder made up of miners and nurses. Their solidarity was more than cross-class cooperation—it was a transnational experiment in diaspora democracy, requiring the coordination of different political strategies, languages, and sensibilities.\n\nFrom its inception, Minjon sought to move beyond the confines of an intellectual student circle. A defining case of concrete action was the 1975 Balzheim mine incident. After receiving reports of human rights violations involving Korean miners, Minjon organized its own fact-finding delegation. The team collaborated closely with the German press and civil society, bringing the issue to public attention. For the first time, German society raised formal questions about the Korean government’s overseas labor policy and its compatibility with international human rights standards.\n\nAnother major activity was international solidarity efforts for the release of political prisoners. Minjon supported the release of Kim Ji-ha and Kim Dae-jung through joint statements and campaigns with Amnesty International and German churches. With the help of Professor Günter Freudenberg, Minjon founded the Korea Committee (Korea Komitee), which later evolved into the Korea Verband. Freudenberg stated, “What is happening in Korea is not just their problem. An affront to democracy anywhere must be resisted everywhere”. Through this international network, Minjon succeeded in reframing Korean issues within the global human rights agenda.\n\nOne of the most emblematic examples of this international solidarity was the campaign to save Kim Dae-jung, who had been sentenced to death in 1980 by the Korean military regime. Minjon viewed this not as an individual case, but as a critical moment for Korean democracy itself, and launched a wide-scale campaign aimed at galvanizing global public opinion.\n\nA particularly noteworthy episode involved direct political intervention by the German Protestant Church. In November 1980, Minjon sent a petition to the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) and other major denominations. Soon, leaders from the Lutheran and other Protestant churches issued formal requests to the South Korean government to halt Kim Dae-jung’s execution. One such statement read, “Christians do not remain silent in the face of state violence that threatens life.” This declaration was drafted by Minjon activist Lee Sam-yeol in English and later translated and distributed in German and Korean.\n\nThese international appeals soon translated into diplomatic action. Some members of the German Bundestag raised parliamentary questions regarding the suppression of political freedom in Korea, and the German Foreign Office conveyed human rights concerns through unofficial channels to the South Korean embassy. To support these efforts, Minjon compiled English-language summaries and Korean newspaper clippings on Kim Dae-jung’s case and mailed them directly to German lawmakers and media outlets. This rescue campaign became a sophisticated transnational civic movement that combined advocacy, translation, lobbying, and coalition-building.\n\nAnother urgent priority for Minjon was uncovering the truth behind the Gwangju Uprising of May 1980. After the South Korean media and government portrayed the movement as a violent insurrection, Minjon worked from late 1980 onward to inform the international community of the massacre’s actual scale. They formed a “Gwangju Truth-Finding International Support Committee” with Korean students, miners, and nurses in Germany, and held “Gwangju Uprising Testimony Forums” in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich. These forums featured photographs smuggled out of Korea and testimonies from bereaved families, exposing the indiscriminate killings and press censorship under the military junta.\n\nIn 1981, in collaboration with progressive German journalists, Minjon held a photo exhibition titled “The Truth of Gwangju” (Die Wahrheit von Kwangju) at the Frankfurt City Hall gallery. At the opening ceremony, SPD lawmaker Hans-Georg Werner declared, “What happened in Gwangju is no different from what happened under Hitler’s rule,” sparking international shock. Major German newspapers subsequently covered the Gwangju Massacre in detail. In response, the South Korean government attempted to control damage by pressuring Korean consulates and student associations in Germany to censor such narratives.\n\nFar beyond a passive conduit for information, Minjon became a platform for preserving the memory of Gwangju and enabling truth-seeking in Korea through transnational solidarity. From 1982 onward, Minjon held annual memorials for the Gwangju Uprising in major German cities, attended by German citizens, professors, labor unions, and Christian leaders. Activists such as Song Du-yul, Lee Sam-yeol, and Jeong Gyu-myeong emphasized that “The truth of Gwangju is not just a Korean issue—it is a matter of global conscience,” framing remembrance as a moral imperative for humanity.\n\nThese two campaigns—rescuing Kim Dae-jung and uncovering the truth about Gwangju—are not only milestones in the struggle for Korean democracy. They also demonstrate how Minjon, operating from Germany, built a transnational field of resistance in cooperation with churches, civil society, and the media. These efforts elevated Korean issues onto the global stage and allowed diaspora Koreans to emerge not merely as students or refugees, but as historical actors in their own right.\n\nNonetheless, Minjon's activities were repeatedly threatened by external surveillance and internal discord. The Korean Central Intelligence Agency, working with the South Korean Embassy in Germany, labeled Minjon members as communists, denied them re-entry visas, and harassed their families. Some members ultimately abandoned plans to return home and lived in de facto political exile. After the Gwangju massacre, many in the organization experienced disillusionment, realizing that the fall of the Yushin regime would not automatically usher in democracy. This led to diminished morale and decreased participation.\n\nMinjon also developed in close collaboration with Christian figures and institutions. Leaders such as Lee Sam-yeol, Park Sang-jeung, and Lee Sang-chul connected the movement to the World Council of Churches (WCC) and Protestant networks in Germany, raising the movement’s legitimacy and visibility. A key moment was the 1975 Geneva conference, where the Christian Democratic Fellowship (CDDF) was launched, providing a theological basis for Minjon’s political activism. These Christian activists proclaimed that the Gospel should be lived “in solidarity with the oppressed” and that resistance to dictatorship was an act of faith.\n\nStill, Minjon faced criticism from within the church. As more Marxist-inclined students and activists took leadership, some in the Christian community felt the group was losing its religious neutrality and becoming overly political. This tension came to a head in 1977, when Minjon debated whether to join the National Alliance for Democratic Reunification (Hanminryeon). The ideological division between Christian and secular factions prompted some members to withdraw from the group.\n\nDespite these challenges, Minjon left a lasting impact on Korea’s democratization movement. The release of Kim Dae-jung, global awareness of the Gwangju Massacre, and international critiques of Korea’s human rights record all owed much to Minjon’s informational and advocacy efforts. The organization’s legacy lived on through its successor, the Association of Korean National-Democratic Movements in Europe (Yureop Minhyeop), which continued the democratization and reunification movement into the late 1980s. More than a single organization, Minjon became a model for how diasporic Koreans could organize across borders, sustain political memory, and influence history from afar.\n\n\nChristian Democratic Fellowship\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Christian Democratic Fellowship of Koreans (CDFK), based in Germany, stood out as a unique example of faith-based democratic resistance within the Korean diaspora. Responding to the political repression and human rights violations of the era, CDFK emerged not as a formally established organization at a fixed moment, but rather as a fellowship organically formed by Korean Christians in Germany—many of whom, like Yi Sam-yŏl, Chŏng Chi-yŏng, and Yi Chin-san, had earlier participated in the Democratic Society Construction Council (민건). Their shared conviction was clear: “faith and democracy are inseparable.”\n\nOne of the most urgent issues to which CDFK responded was the 1980 Gwangju Uprising and, more critically, the Korean church’s silence regarding the massacre. CDFK interpreted the events in Gwangju not as a regional or political disturbance but as a theological event demanding a faith-based response. In a statement issued on June 5, 1980 in Bonn, they declared:\n\n“God stands with the oppressed, and the innocent victims in Gwangju bear the image of Christ on the cross. Their blood cries out to heaven, and the church on earth must no longer remain a co-conspirator in silence. We respond to the cries of the Gwangju people in the name of faith, and call the Korean church to repentance and awakening.”\n\nThis statement was partially published in a German Protestant periodical and led to joint prayer services with groups such as the Berliner ökumenischer Friedenskreis. On June 10, CDFK organized solidarity demonstrations in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Hamburg, drawing around 300 participants, including German citizens, Korean workers, and students. At one such rally, Yi Sam-yŏl gave a speech proclaiming:\n\n“The Korean church is turning away from the cross. Gwangju is not only the pain of the southern provinces; it is a judgment upon all believers. CDFK gathers here today to ask what it means to be the church on the side of God.”\n\nFrom 1981 onward, CDFK held annual memorial prayer services for Gwangju, collaborating with German Protestant congregations. These services included communal worship, moments of silence, and open reflection. In 1982, the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) regional newsletter even reported on these gatherings. CDFK also maintained active correspondence and solidarity with South Korean Christian resistance groups, particularly the NCCK Human Rights Committee and the Christian Social Action Council in Seoul. In 1985, when the NCCK published its Social Participation Declaration, CDFK issued a public statement of support and translated the document into German, distributing it to WCC-affiliated bodies and church groups throughout Europe.\n\nBeyond institutional ties, CDFK also maintained informal connections with student and youth resistance organizations such as KSCF and Minchŏngryŏn, exchanging news and publications. In 1986, a CDFK member gave a presentation titled “The Church’s Responsibility in Korea’s Democratization” at the WCC Youth Forum, further solidifying their role as a bridge between Korean and international Christian movements.\n\nDuring the June 1987 Democracy Movement, CDFK again took public action, organizing rallies and issuing a powerful statement titled “A Confession and Plea from Christians”. It read:\n\n“We are watching Korea’s June from Germany. God is on the side of truth and liberation, not falsehood and oppression. We ask Korean Christians: whom does your faith serve?”\n\nThis message was sent directly to the NCCK and excerpts were printed in Seoul-based Christian newsletters.\n\nIn 1988, CDFK added its voice to an international joint statement calling for inter-Korean church dialogue. Taking the initiative, CDFK sent letters proposing a North-South Korean Christian joint prayer service to both the Presbyterian Church (Hapdong) and the Korean Methodist Church. The reaction was swift: Hapdong denounced the proposal as “a theological compromise with socialism,” and several conservative Korean pastors in Germany followed suit, denouncing CDFK in Korean-language diaspora newspapers as a “political agitation group” corrupting the Gospel.\n\nIn response, CDFK published a theological counter-statement, asserting:\n\n“Our call for national reconciliation is not an ideological compromise but a restoration of peace and life based on God’s creative order. The church must stop cloaking division and enmity in the language of faith.”\n\nThis exchange highlighted a growing theological divide between progressive and conservative churches—particularly around the notion of a mission-driven vision of unification. Despite strong opposition, CDFK remained committed to what they called a “theology of reconciliation” and a “faith that crosses the lines of division.” Their example inspired later generations of diaspora Christians to consider public justice, democracy, and unification as core expressions of their religious calling.\n\n\nTable 13.

While the movement narrative explores their theological motivations and historical impact, this table presents their organizational features at a glance, allowing readers to quickly grasp their origins, structure, key figures, ideological orientation, and geographical scope.\n\nImportantly, this side-by-side format highlights how both groups—though differing in form—shared a foundational link to Christianity. Minjeon included many Christian individuals motivated by a progressive faith-based conscience, even if the organization itself was not explicitly religious. In contrast, CDFK was formed explicitly on Christian theological grounds, with prayer, worship, and ecumenical dialogue at the core of its activities.\n\nBy placing these organizations in comparison, the table illustrates how Christian ethics and theology shaped not only their values but also their modes of resistance. This context sets the stage for understanding the theological-political praxis that unfolds more fully in the subsequent movement section.\n\n\nCatholic Priests’ Association for Justice\n\n\nThe Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) in the 1980s transformed religion into a means of achieving public justice. It became one of the most powerful and consistent expressions of faith-based action in South Korea’s democratization movement. CPAJ connected faith with justice, prayer with protest, and the church with civil society, standing against state violence and authoritarian rule. Most significantly, their practice extended beyond church walls and mobilized the public with dynamic energy.\n\nPrayer was not silence, and street marches were not retreat. From 1986 to 1987, priests led protest marches following prayer vigils at least 17 times, restoring the tradition of public resistance by religious figures that had been nearly extinguished since the Yushin regime. During the constitutional reform crisis of 1987, almost every Catholic diocese in the country participated in hunger strikes—transforming individual suffering into an unprecedented nationwide religious action.\n\nMyeongdong Cathedral was more than a place of worship. It became the only \"sanctuary\" in a city paralyzed by the Park Chung-hee regime, and CPAJ turned it into a refuge for democracy. At certain moments, 300 to 400 priests gathered to celebrate Mass for justice, constituting an unparalleled collective act of priestly resistance in Korean religious history. As vigils, fasts, declarations, and marches were repeated, CPAJ established itself as an independent body within the church. In 1989 alone, CPAJ organized nine “Prayer Vigils for Democracy and National Reunification” across the country, each accompanied by hunger strikes and public statements. This consistent, nationwide mobilization was no longer just religious observance—it was the formation of a spiritual movement. These actions also elevated the Catholic Church’s social status. Over a ten-year period, the number of Catholic believers in South Korea doubled, suggesting that CPAJ’s influence extended beyond political resistance to strengthening the identity and growth of the faith community. CPAJ’s impact was not strategic church expansion—it was a natural consequence of speaking truth through faith.\n\nCPAJ extended its resistance beyond domestic boundaries by forming international Christian networks, notably with the World Council of Churches (WCC). Their partnership signaled that CPAJ’s efforts were not just a local resistance but part of a global struggle for justice. In 1975, the WCC convened an emergency meeting in Geneva on the Korean crisis. At this meeting, the Korean Christian Fellowship for Democracy was established, with Rev. Kim Jae-jun elected as chair. This organization became a vital bridge between CPAJ, progressive Protestant forces, and the international ecumenical movement, allowing CPAJ to consistently share its work on the global stage.\n\nIn 1984, the WCC held a conference in Dozan-so, Japan, focused on the theme of Korean reunification, framing Korean democratization as a matter of theological and moral concern. CPAJ’s actions were interpreted there not merely as political protest but as acts of faithful solidarity with the oppressed, and the WCC incorporated them into its expanded theology of structural human rights. At the time, WCC's theological core had shifted from a focus on individual religious freedom to one of liberationist response to structural violence and oppression. When CPAJ denounced the National Security Law, labor oppression, and division through prayer and Mass, the WCC recognized these as part of “the liberating testimony of global Christianity” and disseminated them across denominational lines.\n\nIn 1987, amid the June Democratic Uprising, the WCC responded to requests from CPAJ and the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) by helping submit human rights violation reports to the United Nations Human Rights Commission European and North American Catholic communities translated and distributed CPAJ’s statements, praising Korea as a place where “a praying church became a resisting church.”\n\nAfter the controversial visit to Pyongyang by Father Moon Kyu-hyun in 1989, CPAJ was formally distanced by the Catholic hierarchy. The bishops issued a public statement saying, “The Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice is not an officially recognized organization,” thereby cutting official ties. Following this, CPAJ operated more independently, forging alliances not within institutional religion, but with civil society, ecumenical circles, and international networks.\n\nThe work of CPAJ in the 1980s was a testament to the history of conscience-driven faith clashing with state power. To “pray” meant to resist dictatorship, and to “fast” meant to share in the suffering of the oppressed. Their actions proved that faith, when practiced ethically, could illuminate the path to justice in dark times.\n\n\nUrban Industrial Mission (UIM)\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) in South Korea evolved beyond simple worker evangelism into a faith-based movement that directly confronted the country’s structural contradictions. Centered around the interdenominational organization known as the Korean Christian Social Mission Council (SASEON), UIM developed a comprehensive and organized structure that engaged deeply with labor, peasant, urban poor, environmental, and democratization movements. The cases of the Yeongdeungpo UIM, SASEON, and the Busan branch of the Korea Pollution Research Institute (KPRI) are especially illustrative of how Christian activism during this period became intertwined with Korea’s wider social and political transformation.\n\nUIM’s activities were first and foremost grounded in the labor field. The Yeongdeungpo UIM worked directly with female factory workers in the Guro Industrial Complex, embodying the conviction that “a labor union is a church for workers.” Rather than emphasizing institutional churches, UIM built community through daily life and solidarity on the factory floor. It organized savings cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and housing collectives, integrating spiritual commitment with survival. One participant recalled, “When I took charge of the credit union, I witnessed the kingdom of God realized on the labor front through the devotional life of the pastors and missionaries.”\n\nThis movement became more organized with the establishment of SASEON in 1976. As an ecumenical collaboration between Protestants and Catholics, SASEON initiated cooperative social missions alongside laborers, farmers, the urban poor, and students—an unprecedented form of interdenominational Christian practice in Korean church history. SASEON declared that “the realization of the Kingdom of God begins not within church walls, but in places of suffering,” and it transcended theological and denominational boundaries. Services utilized a jointly translated Bible, alternated between the Protestant “Hananim” and the Catholic “Haneunim” for “God,” and replaced Eucharist with symbolic shared meals. “It wasn’t doctrinal unity, but the shared tears and laughter that built our church,” one member reflected.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, this movement expanded into environmental issues. The Korea Pollution Research Institute (KPRI), especially its Busan branch, emerged as a key actor. From its founding in 1984, the Busan branch declared that “pollution is not merely an environmental issue but a social evil rooted in the structural contradictions of our society and our nation,” and emphasized solidarity with broader human rights and labor movements. Though nominally subordinate to the Seoul headquarters, the Busan branch operated with substantial autonomy.\n\nThe turning point came with the Onsan disease crisis, which propelled the Busan branch into full-scale anti-pollution activism. In 1985, the branch began publishing the monthly newsletter Pollution and Society, and conducted public education and advocacy efforts across affected areas, including around the Kori nuclear plant and polluted industrial zones like Jangnim and Sasang. It declared that pollution must be approached not just as a public health issue, but as a matter of “life, justice, and peace,” and that “pollution eradication is a movement for life and a movement for peace.”\n\nThe Busan branch also played a major role in founding the Busan Democratic Citizens’ Council (Buminhyup) in 1985. While formally distinct, the two organizations were functionally intertwined. As activist Kang Mi-kyung recalled, “There was no real distinction between Gongmunyeon and Buminhyup—it just became Buminhyup. Even I just drifted from one to the other.” Buminhyup focused on democratization while the KPRI focused on environmental issues, yet both shared personnel, goals, and organizational infrastructure.\n\nIn 1989, the Busan branch transitioned into the Citizens’ Coalition for Pollution Eradication (Gongchu-hyup), in line with shifting societal concerns. This new organization addressed pressing issues like nuclear power risks, water pollution, and industrial waste, while promoting “pollution eradication and anti-nuclear activism as the foundation for democracy and national peace.” Gongchu-hyup would later become the Busan Federation for Environmental Movements (KFEM Busan) in 1993, continuing the legacy of Christian-driven civic and environmental action.\n\nThe work of UIM, SASEON, and the Busan KPRI was not merely a Christian social outreach, but a core component of Korea’s democratization movement. These were not isolated acts of charity, but conscious efforts to find the Kingdom of God in the lives of the oppressed, to reimagine theology through solidarity, and to transform faith into public justice. And while the names have changed, the spirit of these movements—rooted in democracy, life, and justice—continues in new forms today.\n\n\n ",
