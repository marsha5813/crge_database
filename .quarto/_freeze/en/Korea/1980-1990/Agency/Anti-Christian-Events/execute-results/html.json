This period saw the regime simultaneously suppressing underground Christian communities while leveraging state-controlled religion for diplomatic purposes—creating a dual structure of religious life that endures today.\n\nIn 1980, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) initiated contact with the World Council of Churches (WCC), which signaled a strategic shift. The North Korean regime began to see religion—specifically Christianity—not just as a threat, but as a potential tool of international engagement. From 1981 to 1984, North Korean delegates attended ecumenical conferences in Vienna, Helsinki, and Dozan, where they raised human rights issues in South Korea and promoted narratives aligned with DPRK policy. These interactions were not signs of religious openness but carefully orchestrated diplomatic maneuvers.\n\nDomestically, the regime simultaneously revived the Pyongyang Seminary in 1974, placing it under KCF control. The seminary operated with about 10 students per cohort in a three-year program. “Pyongyang Seminary operates on a three-year cycle, with about ten students per class. Since its first graduates in 1974, over 100 have completed the program by 2002. Graduates were dispatched as evangelists to Bongsu and Chilgol churches, eventually receiving ordination. However, the curriculum emphasized loyalty to Kim Il Sung and Juche ideology over biblical theology, turning the institution into a mechanism of religious control rather than a true theological school.\n\nThis strategy was most visibly embodied in the construction of Bongsu Church, which officially opened on November 6, 1988. Built in preparation for the 1989 Pyongyang World Festival of Youth and Students, the church was intended to project an image of religious tolerance. A pastor involved in the building of Bongsu Church recalled: “Rehearsals were held the day before any foreign visitor arrived. The congregation and service were scripted ahead of time.” Attendees were handpicked Party loyalists, and sermons followed government-approved scripts. Bongsu Church functioned less as a space of worship and more as a religious stage for the benefit of foreign observers.\n\nReligious infrastructure was further expanded with the publication of home-use Bibles and hymnals in 1983. Although this appeared to reflect an easing of religious repression, it remained tightly controlled. In the early 1990s, about 10,000 copies of state-approved Bibles and hymnals were printed in cooperation with the United Bible Societies and distributed to Bongsu and Chilgol churches. “It is believed that some expressions in the Bible were altered to avoid conflict with Juche ideology.”\n\nNorth Korean hymnals, unlike those used in the South, featured only lyrics without musical notation and were based on pre-1945 songs. “They excluded emotionally expressive hymns or those reflecting South Korean theological trends.” This editorial choice reflected the regime’s discomfort with the emotive and potentially subversive power of Christian worship. Behind these officially sanctioned institutions, however, lay a persistent underground church. During the 1966–1969 nationwide classification campaign, over 20,000 Christian households (about 70,000 individuals) were forcibly relocated to remote mountainous and mining regions. There, underground believers organized clandestine worship—memorizing scripture, gathering in homes, and sharing faith in secret. By the mid-1980s, Pyongyang alone reportedly had at least 100 underground house churches, with approximately 1,000 registered believers, though unofficial estimates put the number of underground Christians at around 100,000. These communities often relied on charismatic experiences—healing, visions, tongues—as sources of spiritual authority. “Evangelism wouldn’t work without miracles,” one defector recalled.\n\nThe early 1980s also saw significant shifts in how underground Christians engaged with the state. In anticipation of the 6th Party Congress in 1980, the regime declared a partial amnesty for certain “hostile class” individuals, including former Christians. Some of these individuals returned from exile and rejoined clandestine church networks. KCF Secretary Ko Ki-jun stated in 1981 that “there are more than 500 places of worship nationwide,” suggesting that some level of house-church revival was occurring under strict surveillance.\n\nStill, this era was also marked by continued repression. According to the extensive documentation by Pastor Ban Suk Lee, at least 16,984 Christians were executed or imprisoned for their faith between 1945 and 2006, with 761 recorded cases, many occurring during the 1980s. Common offenses included possession of a Bible, leading secret services, or evangelizing—any of which could result in imprisonment, torture, or execution.\n\nIn the border regions of Ryanggang and North Hamgyong, the late 1980s saw the emergence of a second-generation underground movement. North Koreans who had encountered Christianity while in China returned and began organizing home worship among their families. Their faith was shaped by experiential theology—focused on dreams, healing, and prophecy. One defector recounted, “We hid the Bible under our pillows and prayed under blankets so no sound would escape. Those caught disappeared without a trace.” Accounts like these appear throughout defector testimonies and books such as More Thirsty Than Starving and Evangelism Means Death, reflecting the brutal risks of faith in North Korea during this time.\n\nIn summary, Christianity in 1980s North Korea operated under a paradoxical system: state-controlled religious institutions served propaganda purposes, while authentic Christian faith survived in the shadows through suffering and resilience. This dual structure—between ceremonial religion and persecuted faith—would shape North Korean religious policy into the 1990s and beyond, especially amid famine and growing international humanitarian engagement.\n\n ",
