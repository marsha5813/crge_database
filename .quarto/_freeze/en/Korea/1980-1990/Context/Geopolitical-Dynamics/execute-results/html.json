Among these relationships, those with Japan and China were particularly significant from the standpoint of Christianity.\n\nWith Japan, formal diplomatic relations between the two countries had been normalized since 1965, yet societal resentment toward colonial-era atrocities remained deeply rooted. Despite this, Christian organizations in Japan, such as the Korean Christian Church in Japan (KCCJ), played an outsized role in fostering reconciliation and supporting Korean democratization movements. The KCCJ, consisting largely of Zainichi Korean Christians, hosted forums on human rights abuses in South Korea and provided platforms for exiled Korean pastors and intellectuals. These activities served as an informal bridge for transnational Christian solidarity at a time when official diplomatic relations remained politically cautious.\n\nChina’s case was more complex. Although South Korea and the People’s Republic of China did not establish formal diplomatic ties until 1992, informal religious exchanges emerged in the border regions, particularly among ethnic Korean Christians in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. These communities maintained historical Christian traditions dating back to early Protestant missions and served as a cultural reservoir of Christianity across the Sino-Korean frontier. Due to strict control of religion under the Chinese Communist Party, such Christian activities were limited in scale and typically disconnected from formal diplomacy, yet their significance lies in their quiet endurance and the symbolic imagination of pan-Korean Christian identity.\n\nWhile other Asia-Pacific countries such as the Philippines or Indonesia had Christian populations, their relevance to Korean Christianity in the 1980s remained minimal in terms of diplomatic or missionary engagement. Likewise, explicit state-level missionary diplomacy was limited during this period and will be more fully addressed in our forthcoming analysis of 1990s Christian foreign policy strategies.\n\n\nRelations with Christian-Majority Countries: Democratization and Diasporic Churches\n\nAmong Christian-majority countries, the United States and West Germany were most influential in shaping the religious and political landscape of 1980s Korean Christianity. In both cases, the impact was not primarily diplomatic but rather rooted in missionary legacy, ecumenical solidarity, and diaspora church activism.\n\nIn the United States, long-time mission partners such as the Presbyterian Church (PCUSA), the United Methodist Church, and the National Council of Churches became vocal critics of South Korea’s military dictatorship. They collaborated with Korean-American churches and civic organizations to raise awareness of political repression and support human rights. Korean Christian leaders such as Moon Ik-hwan and Kim Jae-jun leveraged these networks during their overseas visits, using them to amplify demands for democratization and religious freedom.\n\nIn West Germany, the presence of Korean labor migrants—especially nurses and miners—laid the foundation for a politically conscious diaspora church network. Leaders such as Rev. Jang Sung-hwan transformed Bible studies into spaces of political education, drawing parallels between biblical justice and Korean democratization. German missionaries like Dorothea Schweizer and Dietrich Richter actively supported these movements, often facing surveillance or expulsion for their involvement. Their activism illustrated how Christian solidarity could extend beyond theological dialogue into concrete resistance against authoritarianism.\n\nRelations with other Christian-majority nations such as Canada, Australia, or Latin American countries remained relatively limited in this decade. The Vatican’s engagement with Korean Catholicism also remained primarily ecclesiastical rather than diplomatic, although Catholic solidarity with democratization efforts was notably strong within Korea itself.\n\nAgain, more comprehensive missionary cooperation—especially institutionally driven mission strategies—emerged in the 1990s and will be analyzed separately in the next stage of this project.\n\n\nNationalism and Patriotic Culture in the 1980s: A Divided Christianity\n\nUnder the Chun Doo-hwan regime, the South Korean government aggressively promoted a form of state-centered nationalism that emphasized anti-communism, Confucian loyalty, and national development. Patriotism was embedded into the daily rhythms of life through public rituals, mandatory flag ceremonies, broadcast patriotic music, and school recitations of the National Education Charter. This nationalism was instrumental in justifying authoritarian rule and suppressing dissent, framed as threats to national unity.\n\nChristian responses to this nationalism were divided. Conservative churches—especially those aligned with large denominations and megachurches—often supported the regime, equating anti-communism with faithfulness to God and country. Prominent pastors such as Han Kyung-jik maintained cooperative relationships with the state, reinforcing the image of Protestantism as a guardian of the republic.\n\nIn contrast, progressive Christian movements—centered around minjung theology and the Korean Christian Student Federation (KSCF)—rejected this narrow nationalism. They articulated a theology of the oppressed that viewed the true nation not as the authoritarian state, but as the suffering people. Public statements, liturgies, and martyr commemorations often blurred the line between worship and protest. For these communities, nationalism was not inherently wrong—but it needed to be redeemed from state manipulation and returned to its ethical and prophetic roots.\n\nThus, nationalism in 1980s Korea cannot be understood apart from Christianity. It was not merely a secular ideology but a site of deep theological contestation. The split between accommodationist and resistance-oriented churches reveals how the Christian community itself became a microcosm of the nation’s fractured identity.\n\n\n ",
