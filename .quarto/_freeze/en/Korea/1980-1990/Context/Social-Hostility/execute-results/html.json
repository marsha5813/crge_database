Emerging from the democratization struggle, Minjung Theology sought to understand God's presence among the oppressed masses and was closely aligned with the broader liberation theology movement. However, conservative evangelical circles in Korea condemned it as heretical, accusing it of diluting biblical authority and being influenced by Marxism.\n\nProminent megachurch pastors publicly denounced it, stating, “Minjung Theology romanticizes socialist revolution and distorts the essence of Christian faith.” In response, theologian Suh Nam-dong argued, “The Minjung are not merely a class—they are the very people to whom Jesus first drew near. The Gospel is realized in their midst.” The debate went beyond rhetoric, leading to real consequences such as pulpit dismissals, publication bans, and canceled speaking engagements.\n\nDespite this opposition, organizations like the Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development and the Korea Theological Study Institute worked to foster dialogue between differing theological camps and to reclaim the public role of the Gospel. The National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), while actively participating in democratization, also led efforts to foster theological reconciliation. In 1986, these efforts culminated in the “Declaration of Solidarity with the Minjung,” which stated, “The Gospel of the Kingdom of God is revealed fully when it is proclaimed among those who suffer.”\n\n\nIdeological Hostility in North Korea: Christianity as an Enemy of the State\n\nIn North Korea during the 1980s, Christianity continued to be treated not merely as a religious deviation but as a political threat to the regime. While the constitution nominally guaranteed freedom of religion, the regime’s ideological apparatus framed Christianity as a tool of American imperialism and labeled Christians as “reactionary spies.”\n\nAccording to History of Christianity in North Korea, “Christians are regarded as agents of U.S. imperialism, seeking to subvert the socialist state.” In one reported incident from 1983, a house church leader in North Pyongan Province was arrested during a secret worship service and publicly executed following a show trial. The World Alliance of Reformed Churches later issued a formal protest.\n\nDespite this harsh repression, North Korea attempted to create a more tolerant international image through the Korean Christian Federation (KCF). The KCF acted as a diplomatic front, establishing contact with the World Council of Churches (WCC) and portraying North Korea as a nation where religious freedom was respected. In 1988, the Bongsu Church in Pyongyang was re-opened—ostensibly for foreign visitors—and the KCF claimed, “Our Republic guarantees true religious freedom.”\n\nHowever, such moves were largely performative, designed to appeal to international observers. Real integration or religious freedom remained absent, as Christianity continued to be treated as a systemic threat to the regime.\n\n\nAnti-Christian Secularism and the Recovery of Public Witness in South Korea\n\nIn the late 1980s, particularly after the June Democratic Uprising of 1987, Korean civil society began to mature, and with it came a wave of criticism toward the Church. Intellectuals and activists, disillusioned with the Church’s past complicity with the authoritarian regime, began to question its moral authority. Accusations such as “The Church has sold out to power and privilege” gained traction in public discourse, especially in universities.\n\nThe first issue of The Word (Malssŭm) magazine in 1987 editorialized, “The Church has lost its prophetic voice and colluded with the powers that be. It must now reflect on its silence before the suffering of the people.” As distrust grew, some students withdrew from Christian groups and rejected religious identity altogether.\n\nIn response, efforts to reintegrate the Church into public trust emerged. Movements like the Christian Social Responsibility Campaign, YMCA, YWCA, and the Urban Industrial Mission took proactive steps to rebuild the Church’s credibility. These groups partnered with laborers, farmers, and marginalized populations to embody the Gospel through social engagement. The Urban Industrial Mission notably emphasized, “The will of God must be realized in the workplace,” and its pastors led worship in worker dormitories and joined labor strikes, redefining what public Christian witness could mean.
