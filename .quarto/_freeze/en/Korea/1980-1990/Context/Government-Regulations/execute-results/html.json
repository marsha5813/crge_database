After seizing power through a military coup, the Chun Doo-hwan regime, lacking political legitimacy, pursued a dual strategy of mass mobilization and ideological justification through religious institutions. Religious groups that cooperated with the state were rewarded, while those that were critical of the regime were subjected to pressure or outright suppression. As a result, religious communities were pushed beyond the private realm of faith, becoming social actors forced to choose between alignment with authoritarian power and support for democratization.\n\nThe Gap Between Constitutional Guarantees and Practical Control\n\nArticle 20 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea clearly declares, “All citizens shall enjoy the freedom of religion.” Yet under the 1980s military dictatorship, this constitutional clause was applied selectively, adjusted according to political expediency. In practice, “national security discourse, anti-communist ideology, and the rhetoric of social order” dominated religious policy, and a religious group’s political orientation effectively determined the degree of freedom and activity it was allowed to exercise.\n\nThe regime implemented a three-pronged approach to control and co-opt religious groups. First, it justified institutional intervention into religious organizations’ property, education, and operations through laws such as the Traditional Temples Preservation Act (enacted in 1987), the Hyanggyo Property Act, and the Framework Act on Education. Second, it strengthened administrative oversight of religious groups through registration, heritage designations, and surveillance of religious practices in schools. Third, it applied discriminatory treatment based on political loyalty, transforming the idea of religious freedom into a system of rewards for “compliant religiosity”.\n\n\nThe Symbol of Buddhist Suppression: The 10.27 Incident\n\nThis institutionalized control culminated in the notorious “10.27 Incident”, which occurred on October 27, 1980. Under the codename “Operation Plan 45,” the regime deployed military and police forces to 153 Buddhist temples nationwide in a coordinated sweep. Over 200 monks from the Jogye Order were arrested, and more than 5,000 lay followers were detained, in what was one of the largest state-directed religious crackdowns in modern Korean history.\n\nVen. Na Seung-il, then Secretary-General of the Jogye Order at Gaewoon Temple in Seoul, was abducted by plainclothes officers shortly after morning prayers, and at numerous temples monks were subjected to physical violence, verbal abuse, forced abductions, and unlawful detention. Several monks were taken to Jongmyosa Temple in Namyangju and coerced into participating in what was referred to as “Buddhism’s version of re-education”—a state-run ideological conversion program that included psychological and physical abuse.\n\nThe event was a blatant act of political violence intended to force ideological submission on the Buddhist community. As a result, the Buddhist population, which was estimated at 7.5 million before the incident, fell to around 5.4 million afterward, marking a profound weakening of its organizational strength and public base.\n\nAfter his resignation, Chun Doo-hwan took residence at Baekdamsa Temple, symbolically presenting himself as having entered the Buddhist fold. However, many in the religious community interpreted this move as a hollow ritual aimed at securing political absolution, and the Buddhist world itself became deeply divided over whether or not the temple should have accepted him.\n\n\nLegal and Administrative Mechanisms for Structural Intervention\n\nAccording to Religious Legislation and Policy in Korea and Mongolia, the core of religious policy in the 1980s was to manage and steer religion through a legal-administrative framework. Three major laws formed the foundation of this structure:\n\nThe Traditional Temples Preservation Act enacted on November 28, 1987, and enforced from May 29, 1988 (Act No. 3974), allowed the state to designate Buddhist temples as cultural heritage sites and provide funding for maintenance. However, in practice, the law legitimized state intervention in temple operations. Through this law, the Cultural Heritage Administration and local governments could monitor temple operations and allocate budgets selectively, effectively using financial leverage to influence religious voices.\n\nThe Hyanggyo Property Law, originally intended to protect Confucian community property, gave the state regulatory authority over the use and allocation of traditional assets, allowing room for political interference in the restoration and operation of regional Hyanggyo schools.\n\nThe Framework Act on Education was revised in 1982 to include Article 6(2), which stipulates that “no religious education shall be permitted in schools established by the state or local governments.” While seemingly neutral, this clause gave the state practical oversight over religious activities in public education and served as a legal basis for intervening in the establishment and operation of religiously affiliated schools under the pretext of neutrality.\n\n\nPolitically Selective Budget Allocation\n\nReligious policy in the 1980s did not stop at legal measures; it was further enforced through strategic allocation of state resources. The government administered direct and indirect financial support to religious institutions through ministries such as the Cultural Heritage Administration, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nPreferential Support for Friendly Religious Orders:\n\nReligious institutions that maintained close ties with the Chun Doo-hwan regime—such as certain Protestant denominations and Buddhist leaders—received state subsidies for private school foundations, overseas mission work, and temple maintenance. For example, evangelical Protestant churches that prioritized overseas missions received cultural exchange funds via the Overseas Cultural Promotion Agency or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Their seminaries also received rapid accreditation from the Ministry of Education, whereas schools affiliated with critical denominations experienced delays and audit pressure.\n\nAdministrative Sanctions for Critical Orders:Religious groups critical of the regime were subjected to various forms of administrative reprisal, including:\n\nTax Audits: Catholic institutions affiliated with the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) were targeted by the National Tax Service for audits. These were not primarily aimed at legal enforcement but served as psychological pressure and a tool to provoke internal conflict.\n\nCultural Heritage Designation Suspensions: Cultural heritage status or restoration funding for temples and churches was retracted or suspended as a way to tacitly punish political dissent.\n\nDelays in School Accreditation: Protestant theological seminaries and schools affiliated with NCCK-member denominations, known for their criticism of the regime, reportedly faced delays or rejection in legal recognition and teacher qualification approvals.\n\nThese examples show that religious activities, though constitutionally protected, were de facto treated as conditional liberties, contingent on the extent to which religious bodies aligned themselves with the regime. Thus, during the 1980s, religious freedom existed in form but operated in reality as a system of rewarded obedience, employed as a tool of practical governance.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThe 1980s marked a pivotal turning point in North Korea’s religious policy. During this period, the regime redefined Christianity not simply as a target for elimination but as a phenomenon that could be controlled and strategically utilized for political and diplomatic purposes. The core of this policy involved restructuring the visible framework of institutional religion under strict state control, while creating the illusion for the international community that “religion was alive” in North Korea. In other words, religion was no longer merely suppressed—it was functionalized within limits that served national interests.\n\nThe 1972 Socialist Constitution codified the contradictory provision that “citizens shall have both freedom of religion and freedom of anti-religious propaganda,” laying the legal foundation for the regime’s dual religious policy. By the 1980s, this policy had evolved into concrete measures. The goal shifted from suppression to strategically using religion as a marker of ideological conformity. Following Kim Jong Il’s official designation as successor in 1974, the regime faced the task of reinforcing its historical legitimacy and moral authority. In this context, religion was made to function in two contradictory ways: while remaining a potential threat, it also served as a vehicle to legitimize the hereditary regime within tightly staged boundaries. At times, state propaganda emphasized that Kim Il Sung “understood the spirit of Christianity,” highlighting his family’s Presbyterian background to construct a dual image.\n\nBehind these policies lay a parallel structure between Juche ideology and religious expression. The “Ten Principles for the Establishment of the Monolithic Ideological System” declared that “Kim Il Sung’s instructions must be accepted as doctrine and his authority must be made absolute,” thus mimicking the logic of religious dogma. Kim Jong Il’s 1982 treatise On the Juche Idea defined Juche as a human-centered philosophy proclaiming that “man is the master of everything and decides everything,” thereby institutionalizing a system in which the supreme leader assumed quasi-religious authority.\n\nIn practice, the official religious institutions became tools of social order and internal control. Churches no longer served as free spaces of worship but instead functioned as mechanisms for sorting and isolating ideologically conforming believers. “Recognized churches were not just places of worship—they were instruments for organizing and containing believers deemed trustworthy by the regime.” Pastors ceased to be theological guides and instead served as ethical educators who interpreted Party morality and taught obedience.\n\nThe most visible example of this transformation was the construction of Bongsu Church in 1988, which was built in preparation for the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students in Pyongyang. Designed as a religious façade for foreign visitors, “the church was constructed for international political consideration and functioned more as a propaganda stage than a house of worship.”\n\nThe structure of North Korean Christianity increasingly took the form of a divided communication system—between external and internal messaging. While externally showcasing religious freedom, the internal reality was marked by tight surveillance and ideological control. Go Young-eun analyzed this as a “closed but outward-oriented communication structure,” in which religion no longer functioned as an expression of faith but as a symbolic language for maintaining the regime.\n\n\nInter-Korean Unification Policies and Religion\n\n\nThe 1980s marked a period of significant transition in unification policies in both South and North Korea. During this time, religious institutions—especially those within Christianity—responded actively and sought to shape unification discourse. Both governments’ unification strategies were closely linked to regime survival, and religious organizations in the South and North became deeply involved, either forming their own positions or exerting influence on public debates and international perceptions.\n\n\nSouth Korea’s Unification Policy and Religious Involvement\n\nThe Chun Doo-hwan regime, being a military dictatorship with weak political legitimacy, bolstered anti-communist ideology while nominally proposing a \"National Harmony and Democratic Unification Plan\". However, in substance, this policy was closer to an absorption-type unification strategy, which excluded realistic cooperation from the North and assumed one-sided integration. As democratization movements intensified in South Korea during the 1980s, unification discourse became increasingly vibrant within civil society, and religious circles took a leading role. A prominent example is as follows: The National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) released its historic “Declaration on the National Reunification and Peace of the Korean Church” in 1988. This statement adopted the three principles of the July 4 Joint Statement—autonomy, peace, and national unity—but emphasized humanitarianism and democratic participation as essential values. The declaration was a bold attempt to provide a moral and ethical alternative to state-centered unification narratives. Moreover, the NCCK collaborated with international partners such as the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the United Church of Canada, establishing inter-Korean ecumenical dialogue channels. These partnerships sought to legitimize unification discussions morally on the global stage through international ecumenism.\n\n\nNorth Korea’s Unification Policy and Religious Response\n\nAt the 6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in 1980, North Korea formalized its proposal for the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryŏ. Based on a \"one nation, one state, two systems, two governments\" model, this plan rejected both absorption and war-based unification in favor of gradual coexistence and phased integration. Although preconditions like the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the South were unacceptable to Seoul, this vision nonetheless reflected mutual influence between the North and South amid rising democratic aspirations and unofficial exchanges. The 1988 visits by Rev. Moon Ik-hwan and student activist Im Su-kyung to Pyongyang were watershed moments. These events led North Korean authorities to recognize the potential of religion as a diplomatic tool. Thereafter, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) began to actively engage with overseas churches and progressive South Korean denominations. This international outreach eventually expanded into the humanitarian aid exchanges of the 1990s, with religion functioning as a strategic channel for regime survival and soft diplomacy.\n\n\nThe Three Missiological Strategies of South Korean Churches\n\nDuring this period, South Korean churches broadly followed one of three strategic lines in their approach to North Korea:\n\nCrusader-style \"Northern Advance\" Missions: Conservative churches viewed North Korea as the \"kingdom of evil\" and advocated unilateral evangelization based on anti-communism. This approach prioritized contact with underground churches and broadcast missions into the North​.\n\nDialogue-based Missiology: Progressive churches adopted ecumenical theological frameworks and emphasized exchange and cooperation with North Korean churches. Through partnership with global Christian institutions, they supported a theology of peaceful reunification​.\n\nAbsorption-oriented Mission Strategy: Following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, some conservative churches anticipated the fall of North Korea and promoted a \"North Korean Church Reconstruction Movement.\" They prepared plans to reestablish churches in North Korea, assuming that unification would follow a South-led model. Some of these efforts continue to this day.\n\n\nOver the course of the 1980s, South Korea gradually shifted from absorption-type unification to phased negotiation, while North Korea maintained its federal proposal as a means of securing regime survival. Within this landscape, religious institutions in both Koreas emerged not as passive objects of policy but as active agents shaping the direction and ethical contours of unification strategies.\n\nProgressive churches in South Korea formulated independent unification theologies, promoted reconciliation, and created moral and spiritual spaces for inter-Korean dialogue.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea utilized the Korean Christian Federation as a buffer channel for international diplomacy, engaging with global churches and reframing religion as a potential contributor to both humanitarian relief and political legitimacy. These developments in the 1980s laid critical groundwork for continued religious engagement in unification and cross-border humanitarian exchanges in the following decades.\n\n\nKorean Protestant Church Growth and Democratization in the 1980s\n\nThe 1980s marked a paradoxical era in South Korean history—a time of both explosive church growth and deep national division under military dictatorship. While the country underwent rapid urbanization, economic development, and authoritarian rule, the Korean Protestant Church expanded rapidly through its decentralized cell structures, spiritual revival movements, and strategic evangelical programs. At the center of this expansion were megachurches like Yoido Full Gospel Church and SaRang Community Church, which mobilized lay leadership through systematic discipleship training and mass evangelism events.\n\nThe theological framework known as the 'Threefold Blessing'—salvation, health, and material prosperity—developed by Rev. Yonggi Cho, became not only a doctrinal hallmark but also a sociocultural response to the post-war, post-colonial anxiety of the Korean people. Churches have become spaces of emotional healing, community rebuilding, and economic hope. The widespread use of prayer mountains, all-night vigils, testimonies of healing, and tongues-speaking illustrated a religiosity rooted in experience and response, rather than abstract belief systems. Weekly worship was not just liturgy, it was emotional catharsis and social support system rolled into one.\n\nMeanwhile, progressive churches aligned with democratization struggles, especially those affiliated with the Korean Christian Church Council (NCCK), the Christian Industrial Mission, and campus groups like KSCF. These churches played pivotal roles in advocating human rights and resisting authoritarianism. However, they did not experience the same numerical growth as the conservative evangelical churches. The latter, by contrast, maintained either politically neutral or cooperative relationships with the regime, positioning themselves as spiritual sanctuaries amid repression.\n\nWhile these two tracks—socially engaged churches and megachurch growth—operated largely in parallel, their influence reshaped Korean Protestantism. Evangelical churches systematized growth via small groups, prayer networks, and mass events, while activist churches expanded theology and public witness. Both contributed to the complex religious ecology of 1980s Korea.\n\n\nTable 1.
