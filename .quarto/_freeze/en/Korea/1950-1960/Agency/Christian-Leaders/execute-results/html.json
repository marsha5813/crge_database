Upon arrival, Rhee immediately emerged as a central political figure and expressed his vision for a Christian-based nation. At his first official service at Jeongdong First Methodist Church, he declared his intent to “build a new nation upon the Word of the Bible,” revealing a governing philosophy rooted in Protestant Christian ideals rather than mere personal faith.\n\nSoon after his return, Rhee organized a political base centered on Protestant leadership, forming the Korean National Independence Promotion Association with prominent pastors and church elders such as Lee Yoon-young and Bae Eun-hee. He also forged close ties with U.S. intelligence networks and Protestant figures affiliated with the OSS. During this time, Rhee portrayed communism as synonymous with atheism, strategically aligning anti-communism with Christian faith as a unified national ideology.\n\nIn 1948, as the Republic of Korea was established and Rhee was elected its first president, his religious orientation became explicitly embedded in state rituals. The first National Assembly was opened with a Christian prayer by Pastor Lee Yoon-young, and Rhee’s inaugural address included a pledge “before God and the people,” reaffirming the theological legitimacy of his rule. His initial cabinet was heavily weighted with Protestants, reflecting an effort to establish Christian principles at the core of national governance.\n\nThis religious inclination also appeared in social and economic policies. Most notably, land reform efforts were interpreted by Rhee as the realization of biblical justice. Article 86 of the 1948 Constitution, which mandated the redistribution of land to tenant farmers, was framed not only as a countermeasure to communist reform but also as an expression of Christian socio-economic ethics—an attempt to embody justice and stewardship through state policy\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 intensified Rhee’s anti-communist posture and his reliance on Christianity as a moral and ideological pillar. Stories of persecution of Christians in North Korea, including the martyrdom of Pastor Sohn Yang-won and Elder Cho Man-sik, were highlighted to portray Christianity as a defender of national freedom. During the war, Rhee institutionalized Christian influence through the establishment of military chaplaincy and prison chaplaincy systems. He also supported the founding of Christian media such as CBS (1954) and Far East Broadcasting Company (1956) and even modified national rituals by replacing compulsory flag salutes with a “gaze of respect,” aligning with Christian objections to idolatry. However, Rhee’s religious policy extended beyond favoritism toward Protestant Christianity; it also entailed direct intervention in and control over other religions. In the 1954–60 period, the government became involved in internal religious conflicts, exacerbating divisions and using them to assert control.\n\nIn Buddhism, Rhee issued the so-called Jeonghwa Yusi (“Purification Edict”) in 1954 during a heated dispute between celibate monks (bigu) and married priests (daechoseung). Although the edict played a role in restructuring the Buddhist order under celibate leadership, it violated the National Assembly’s resolution prohibiting state interference in religion. While some later interpreted the edict as a corrective reform, it also became the origin of prolonged division and violence within Korean Buddhism.\n\nIn Confucian circles, Rhee sided with the Nong-eun faction and was nominated as head of the Confucian Association, marginalizing the traditionalist Jeongtong faction led by Kim Chang-sook. This move strengthened his political influence while weakening Confucian autonomy. Meanwhile, new religious movements were often labeled as pseudo-religions or cults, with their leaders arrested—indicating a substantial infringement on constitutionally guaranteed religious freedom.\n\nAs Rhee’s rule grew increasingly authoritarian, Christianity was no longer just a foundational ideal but an instrument of governance. His 1952 constitutional amendment to allow direct presidential elections, the 1954 third-term amendment, and the centralization of power around Protestant aides like Lee Ki-boong and Lee Gap-seong illustrated how religion and power were tightly intertwined. However, the 1960 March 15 rigged election provoked nationwide protests, culminating in the April 19 Revolution. Rhee eventually stepped down, declaring he was yielding to the “will of the people.” His resignation marked the end of a political-religious experiment in using Christianity as a state ideology.\n\n\nTable 1.

Han Kyung-jik responded promptly with both religious and humanitarian action. In August of the same year, he established the Christian National Salvation Association (기독교구국회) in Busan. This organization provided relief for refugees, supported soldiers, and organized national prayer rallies. For Han, these efforts were not simply emergency responses—they were expressions of a theological conviction that the church must serve as a moral and institutional anchor for the Korean nation in times of crisis​.\n\nHan's work during this period cannot be separated from his central theological and political idea: the Doctrine of Nation-Building through Evangelization (傳道立國論, Jeondo-Ipgukron). First developed in the immediate aftermath of Korea’s liberation in 1945, this concept held that the church—modeled on the representative system of Presbyterian governance—could produce democratic citizens through its evangelistic and educational functions. The more churches were planted, Han believed, the more people would be trained in democratic principles, thus enabling the establishment of a Christian democratic nation. He famously declared that “evangelism is the greatest political movement,” emphasizing the church’s ability to guide national development not only spiritually but also socially and politically​.\n\nIn the 1950s, Han Kyung-jik put this doctrine into action, particularly through the development of Youngnak Church in Seoul. The church, founded to serve war refugees from North Korea, became a base for a wide range of ministries, including orphanages, hospitals, schools, and welfare organizations. These activities reflected Han’s commitment to a form of Christian mission that was not limited to preaching but also included the structural reconstruction of society. His theological commitment to serving the poor and vulnerable was deepened during a period of personal illness in the U.S., where he drew inspiration from figures like St. Francis of Assisi and Leo Tolstoy. This influence led him to prioritize social service and compassion as core elements of his pastoral and theological identity​​.\n\nPolitically, Han did not remain on the sidelines. In the 1952 presidential election, he played a key role in rallying Protestant support for Syngman Rhee, whom he described as a Christian president. Furthermore, he endorsed Pastor Ham Tae-young for the vice presidency. These endorsements reflected Han’s belief that political engagement was not only permissible but necessary for Christians in Korea. Contrary to the abstract notion of the separation of church and state, Han advocated what might be called a public theology of engagement. As Kim Do-hyung observes, Han saw the church’s participation in politics not merely as a right but as a duty in the face of national and ideological crisis​.\n\nIn 1955, Han was elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea, a position that cemented his leadership in the broader Protestant community. From this position, he expanded his influence not only in evangelism but also in education, social reform, and national policy. Throughout this time, anti-communism was central to his theology and public messaging. Based on his traumatic experience in North Korea before his defection, Han viewed communism not simply as a political alternative but as a spiritual enemy—a satanic force that threatened both the church and the nation. In sermons and publications, he often described communism as the “red dragon,” echoing apocalyptic imagery from the Book of Revelation. This theological framing gave moral urgency to the church’s resistance to communism and legitimized its support for South Korea’s anti-communist regime​​.\n\nHan’s anti-communist stance also reflected his alignment with the Christian nationalist movement that emerged during the post-liberation period. Alongside leaders like Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, and Syngman Rhee, he argued that Christianity should serve as the moral foundation of the newly forming Korean state. This belief was articulated most clearly in his 1949 sermon collection Christianity and Nation-Building (건국과 기독교), which was compiled from messages delivered at Youngnak Church between 1946 and 1947. In these sermons, Han contrasted Christian democracy with atheistic republicanism and communism, emphasizing the former as Korea’s best and only option for a just and free future​.\n\nThrough these efforts, Han Kyung-jik contributed not only to the physical reconstruction of postwar Korea but also to the shaping of its ideological and moral foundations. His synthesis of evangelism, welfare, anti-communism, and political activism laid the groundwork for what would become the dominant orientation of Korean conservative Protestantism in the second half of the 20th century. His influence extended to right-wing youth movements such as the Northwest Youth Association (서북청년단) and played a role in entrenching Christian anti-communism as a major force in national politics​.\n\nIn sum, Han Kyung-jik in the 1950s and 1960s was far more than a pastor—he was a nation-builder, a public theologian, and a moral leader. His thought and actions illustrate a uniquely Korean model of Christian political theology in which spiritual and national redemption were deeply intertwined. His legacy—though increasingly contested in recent years—continues to shape how many in the Korean Protestant community understand the relationship between church and nation.\n\n\n손양원 孫良源 Yang Won Son\n\n07/07/1902 ~ 09/28/1950\n\nSon Yang-won (1902–1950) was a prominent Christian martyr in Korea, whose life was marked by unwavering faith and sacrificial love. From the Japanese colonial period to the outbreak of the Korean War, he lived among the afflicted, especially those suffering from Hansen’s disease, embodying the gospel through every aspect of his life. His journey culminated in what has been called a \"life prepared for martyrdom.\" After Korea’s liberation in 1945, Son returned to the Aeyangwon leprosy sanatorium in Yeosu. For him, Aeyangwon was not merely a medical institution but a community of faith. He lived like family with more than a thousand residents, breaking down social barriers, shaking their hands, eating with them, entering the intensive care units, and even using his mouth to draw out pus from infected wounds when needed. Each day, he prayed, “Lord, help me truly love Aeyangwon,” asking to love them more than his own family. His ministry was not based on pity, but on the incarnational love of Christ made visible. During this time, he traveled throughout Korea to preach at revivals, emphasizing repentance, the return of Christ, and spiritual purity. His messages were not merely words—they were lived sermons. Many testified that they encountered God through his life as much as his preaching.\n\nIn 1948, the Yeosu-Suncheon Incident brought Son perhaps his greatest trial: the martyrdom of his two sons, Dong-in and Dong-shin, at the hands of leftist student rebels. In a shocking act of forgiveness, Son rescued the murderer, Kang Chul-min, from execution and adopted him as his son. At a time when the country was gripped by vengeance and political hatred, Son’s act of love and reconciliation demonstrated the gospel’s power to transcend ideology. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, many Christian leaders and missionaries fled south. But Son refused to leave his flock behind. Instead, he held a special service titled “Let Us Die Well,” where he declared, “First is martyrdom, second is martyrdom, and third is martyrdom. Be ready to die well.” He longed to become a sacrificial offering, saying, “If the Lord permits, I wish to become a sacrifice this time.” Despite numerous pleas for him to escape, Son eventually returned alone to Aeyangwon. On September 13, 1950, he was arrested by Communist forces. He willingly gave himself up to protect the leprosy patients, having heard that unless he surrendered, they would all be massacred. During his fifteen days of detention in the Yeosu Police Station, Son continued his ministry. He prayed every morning during re-education sessions, shared his meager meals with weaker prisoners, and insisted on taking punishment in place of others. He preached tirelessly in word and deed, even under extreme duress.\n\nOn September 28, 1950, while being transferred to Suncheon, he was executed in a peach orchard in Yeosu. According to witnesses, he encouraged his fellow prisoners to pray until the end and even preached to the guards escorting him. His mouth was crushed—reportedly because he kept proclaiming the name of Jesus until his final breath. Son’s death was not that of a mere anti-Communist. While some have labeled him a nationalist or anti-Communist martyr, such ideological interpretations fall short of the depth and integrity of his witness. His life and death were not politically motivated but were deeply rooted in the imitation of Christ. He forgave, loved, and reconciled across enemy lines. He detested ideological divisions and embraced anyone who sought to follow Christ sincerely, regardless of political affiliation. Son Yang-won was, as his children described, “addicted to Jesus.” His martyrdom was not an accident, but the natural outcome of a life wholly consecrated to Christ. As the “Atomic Bomb of Love,” he exploded the power of the gospel—love, forgiveness, and peace—into a society torn by hatred and war. Even today, his life continues to challenge and inspire those who ask what it truly means to live and die as a follower of Christ.\n\n\n김양선 목사  金良善Yang Seon Kim\n\n1907 ~ 10/11/1970\n\nIn the 1950s, Kim Yang-seon emerged as a practical intellectual who deeply reflected on the historical responsibility and mission of the Korean church amid the political and social turmoil following national liberation. In particular, he sought to critically examine how Christianity had functioned in post-liberation Korea and how the church could contribute to society and the nation. His 1956 publication, The Ten-Year History of Korean Christianity After Liberation (韓國基督敎解放十年史), is regarded as a work that best reveals his historical awareness. This book was the first to comprehensively document the movements and developments of Korean Christianity from 1945 to 1955 in a chronological and thematic structure. More importantly, it represented a pioneering effort to position Christianity within the broader context of national history.\n\nIn this work, Kim directly named individuals who had participated in the Japanese-imposed Shinto shrine worship and criticized the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church for its failure to take moral responsibility. He argued that the church must engage in self-reflection and repentance for its historical wrongdoings. This bold critique caused considerable backlash among conservative figures in the denomination, culminating in a 1958 resolution by the General Assembly to ban the publication of his book. However, the controversy sparked by this ban served as a critical turning point in Korean church history, marking one of the earliest calls for ethical reflection and historical responsibility from within the church.\n\nBeyond his critical writings, Kim was also an active educator and revivalist. He taught church history at the Central Theological Seminary for over a decade and worked as a teacher at Soongsil Middle School, where he instilled in students a sense of national and spiritual identity. At the same time, he committed himself to Sunday school education and nationwide revival campaigns. His activities—such as organizing fasting prayers, cooperative evangelism, and lay leadership training—demonstrated his conviction that the gospel must extend beyond individual salvation to serve as a transformative force for society.\n\nHis dedication to Christian education was recognized at the institutional level. In 1958, he received a commendation from the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church for his contributions to educational ministry. In the following year, he served as the director of Sunday school education under the General Assembly’s Department of Education and played a major role in organizing the 44th General Assembly. During this period, he worked to systematize Sunday school programs nationwide, develop educational materials, and train teachers, thereby laying the foundation for Christian education in postwar Korea.\n\nUltimately, the 1950s represent a period in which Kim Yang-seon simultaneously pursued historical insight and practical engagement. Through his writings, he advocated for ethical historiography in the church, while his educational and organizational efforts pointed to a vision of the church grounded in both truth-telling and future-building. For these reasons, he is remembered as a rare figure who combined historical critique with constructive leadership in Korean Christian history.\n\n\n김기창 金基昶 Ki-chang Kim\n\n02/18/1913 ~ 01/23/2001\n\nUnbo Kim Ki-chang (1914–2001) emerged as a pioneer of indigenized Christian art in Korea during the 1950s. Amid the social turmoil and spiritual devastation following the Korean War, Kim dedicated himself to translating the language of faith into visual form. His art became a channel for expressing the suffering, identity, and hope of the Korean people within the framework of the biblical narrative. The 1950s mark a critical turning point in his artistic journey, especially as seen in his magnum opus, The Life of Jesus, which exemplifies the confluence of Eastern and Western aesthetics, personal spiritual reflection, and a strong sense of national consciousness.\n\nThe Life of Jesus, a 30-painting series begun in 1952 and refined through the 1970s, presents the story of Jesus not in its original historical setting, but rather within the context of late Joseon Korea. In these paintings, Jesus appears as a Confucian scholar in traditional attire, and other biblical figures are similarly dressed as Koreans from the 18th or 19th centuries. This bold reimagining is not mere anachronism—it reflects Kim’s theological and artistic attempt to contextualize the Gospel within Korean history and culture. Through this localization, he sought not only to make Christianity more accessible to Koreans but also to offer comfort and hope to a war-torn people.\n\nKim employed traditional Eastern painting techniques, particularly ink-and-wash and elements of Korean folk painting (minhwa), while also preserving the compositional structure and narrative clarity often found in Western religious art. His portrayal of Jesus avoids overt emotionalism and instead relies on restrained lines, minimal color palettes, and meditative spatial balance, inviting deep contemplation. These stylistic choices echo Kim’s own personal story—having lost his hearing due to a childhood illness, he communicated and experienced the world largely through visual perception. Thus, his artistic vision reflects a search for “the language of silence,” and his work becomes a spiritual exercise in visual theology.\n\nThis visual reinterpretation of the Gospel coincided with the Korean people’s urgent need for a restored sense of identity in the aftermath of Japanese colonialism and the Korean War. By portraying Jesus as a figure resembling a Korean nobleman, Kim fused Christian values with Korean ideals of moral leadership and scholarly dignity. While the “yangban Jesus” might suggest social elitism, in Kim’s interpretation, it emphasizes wisdom, virtue, and spiritual authority. In this way, Kim’s art bridges the universality of the Christian message with the specificity of Korean cultural values.\n\nHis work earned him the nickname “Korea’s Rembrandt,” not simply due to artistic skill but because, like Rembrandt who painted Jesus with a Jewish face, Kim depicted Jesus with a Korean face. This move is profoundly theological as well as cultural—it asserts that the incarnation can be meaningfully expressed through every people’s history and visage. Rather than relying on European iconography, Kim reclaims the biblical story from a Korean visual standpoint. His restrained and introspective Jesus contrasts sharply with the dramatic, ornate figures common in Western religious painting, thus conveying a spirituality grounded in silence and suffering.\n\nInternationally, The Life of Jesus series drew attention in exhibitions and Christian art circles as a model of indigenous theology through visual art. Critics noted that Kim's reinterpretation of the Gospel was neither derivative nor exoticized, but a sincere and creative translation of Christian faith into Korean idioms. His work illustrates that Christian art need not imitate the West to be considered authentic; it can instead express the Gospel's truth in a culturally faithful manner. Through this project, Kim demonstrated that art could indeed preach the Gospel in a language beyond words.\n\nIn essence, Kim Ki-chang’s Christian art of the 1950s represents a remarkable integration of traditional Korean aesthetics, modern theology, and personal piety. The Life of Jesus is not merely a series of religious paintings but a profound expression of what it means to encounter the divine in the midst of historical suffering. Kim’s visual theology showed that Jesus’ life could be told as “our story”—the story of the Korean people. His artistic vision continues to resonate in Korean churches, seminaries, and art circles, offering a lasting model of how faith, culture, and creativity can come together in powerful harmony.381011156970\n\n\nAmong the paintings in The Life of Jesus series (https://www.catholictimes.org/article/200304200070438_\n\n\nWilliam Hamilton Shaw \n\n06/05/1922 ~ 09/22/1950\n\nWilliam Hamilton Shaw (Korean name: Seo Wi-ryeom) was born on June 5, 1922, in Pyongyang to American Methodist missionaries William Earl Shaw and Adeline Hamilton Shaw. His parents were key figures in the early Christian mission efforts in Korea, contributing to the establishment of seminaries and hospitals in Pyongyang. Raised in this missionary context, Shaw became fluent in Korean and deeply familiar with Korean life and culture. He graduated from Pyongyang Foreign School and later attended Ohio Wesleyan University in the United States. He eventually enrolled in the doctoral program in East Asian Studies at Harvard University. At the center of his life was always his Christian faith, which manifested itself in his love for others, his willingness to serve, and ultimately, in his self-sacrifice.\n\nDuring World War II, Shaw served as an officer in the United States Navy, participating in the European theater and taking part in the Normandy landings. After the war, from 1946 to 1947, he returned to Korea as an instructor at the Korea Maritime Police Academy in Jinhae (now the Republic of Korea Naval Academy), under the U.S. military government. There, he trained cadets not only in navigation and military tactics but also instilled in them a sense of responsibility and service. Many of his students later became foundational leaders of the South Korean Navy. His contribution was not merely technical; it represented a leadership style rooted in Christian ethics, providing a model of how faith-informed education could shape a newly emerging nation.\n\nWhen the Korean War broke out in 1950, Shaw was pursuing his doctoral studies at Harvard. He voluntarily withdrew from the program and reenlisted in the U.S. Navy. In a letter to his mother, he wrote, “Korea is my home. If the people are fighting for freedom and I am not there with them, I could not live with myself.” This was more than a personal sentiment; it reflected his Christian worldview, his moral conviction, and his understanding of historical responsibility. He identified himself not only as an American or a Korean but ultimately as a citizen of the Kingdom of God, choosing to stand with those who suffered. Thanks to his fluency in Korean and his knowledge of local geography, Shaw was appointed as an intelligence officer under General MacArthur’s command. He participated in the Incheon Landing Operation and soon joined the campaign to recapture Seoul. On September 22, 1950, while operating in the Nokbeon-dong area of Eunpyeong District, he was killed in action during an ambush by North Korean forces. At the time, Shaw was warning civilians to evacuate before an impending artillery strike. He died while attempting to save others, his final act embodying the Christian ideal of laying down one’s life for one’s friends—a form of martyrdom by any theological standard. The U.S. Navy posthumously awarded Shaw the Silver Star, and the South Korean government presented him with the Eulji Order of Military Merit in 1956 and the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit in 2019. Originally buried in Yokosuka, Japan, his remains were relocated to the Yanghwajin Foreign Missionary Cemetery in Seoul in accordance with his mother’s wishes. His gravestone is inscribed with John 15:13: “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” This verse encapsulates his life and faith—a model of a Christian who followed the path of Christ to the end.\n\nToday, Shaw is remembered as a symbol of the Korea–U.S. alliance, with statues erected at the Naval Academy and Peace Park in Eunpyeong, Seoul. However, his legacy should not be confined to military or diplomatic symbolism. Shaw was a missionary’s son who followed the gospel, a disciple of Christ who obeyed God’s calling and gave his life for others. His devotion represents a powerful testimony of how freedom, justice, and faith can be harmonized. His story raises a timeless question for Christians: “For whom, and by what faith, are you living your life today?” William Hamilton Shaw projected the values of the gospel throughout every aspect of his life. He did not regard “freedom” merely as a political concept, nor nation”as an expression of nationalism. His vision was grounded in the love and justice of the Kingdom of God, and for that cause, he willingly gave of himself. His life transcends the Korean War, offering an enduring model of Christian witness across cultures, nations, and generations.\n\n\nHarold Voelkel\n\n02/14/1898 ~ 1975\n\nOne of the most historically significant episodes in the postwar ministry of Harold Voelkel was his pivotal role in the release of anti-communist prisoners of war (POWs) in 1953. As a chaplain at the Geoje Island POW camp during the Korean War, Voelkel dedicated himself to nurturing spiritual freedom and hope through the Gospel among North Korean and Chinese POWs. He supported Christian prisoners who, under grave threat of forced repatriation to the North, wrote blood letters stating “We resolutely oppose repatriation,” which they wore on their foreheads as headbands. Voelkel, moved to tears by their faith and determination, personally delivered one of these blood letters to President Syngman Rhee, leveraging his shared alma mater, Princeton University, to bridge communication. This powerful gesture deeply impressed President Rhee, who was thereby convinced of the strong Christian and pro-democratic presence among the POWs. This event became the catalyst for Rhee’s bold decision to release over 27,000 anti-communist POWs, a move that not only challenged U.S. and UN policies at the time but also precipitated the signing of the Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty just prior to the ceasefire. Voelkel’s role transcended that of a humanitarian or religious figure; his work had tangible geopolitical consequences, shaping postwar diplomacy and national security policy. His commitment to faith-based support within the camps facilitated the creation of Christian communities that mirrored the early church—characterized by shared suffering, encouragement, and fervent prayer. Former POWs testified that they held worship services twice daily, evangelized among fellow prisoners, and experienced spiritual revival under Voelkel’s leadership. In an environment devoid of possessions or comfort, only faith and brotherhood remained.\n\nFollowing the war, Voelkel continued his support for the released Christian POWs. Many, such as Rev. Kim Chang-sik, received scholarships from Voelkel and pursued theological education. Kim would later graduate from Seoul Theological University, become an ordained minister, plant churches in both Korea and the United States, and serve as a professor in seminary education. Such stories illustrate how Voelkel’s postwar ministry extended beyond relief work to the development of Christian leadership in South Korea. His ministry was neither accidental nor merely reactive. Voelkel was part of a wider evangelical movement that aligned Christian values with anti-communist ideology and South Korea’s national identity. His mission reflected a strategic vision that integrated theology, politics, and humanitarian care. Through rebuilding churches, reestablishing seminaries, and fostering U.S.-Korean church relations, Voelkel helped establish the institutional and ideological foundations of modern Korean Protestantism. Voelkel’s postwar legacy continues to resonate not only in theological institutions and congregations but also in the ideological DNA of Korean Christianity—particularly its resistance to communism, alignment with democracy, and emphasis on education. His life serves as a vivid example of how faith, courage, and conviction can shape the destiny of both individuals and nations.\n\n\n함석헌 咸錫憲 Seok-heon Ham\n\n03/13/1901 ~ 02/04/1989In the 1950s, Ham Seok-heon played a pivotal role as a public intellectual and religious thinker in redefining the meaning of freedom and reorienting the role of religion in a rapidly transforming Korean society. This was a period marked by the Korean War, ideological polarization between communism and liberal democracy, and the entrenchment of Cold War politics on the Korean peninsula. Within this context, Ham refused to align himself with either the authoritarian South Korean regime or the hegemonic influence of U.S.-style anti-communism. Instead, he proposed a third way rooted in conscience, spirituality, and ethical responsibility.\n\nHam’s understanding of freedom diverged sharply from the dominant Christian right of the time, which had largely equated freedom with anti-communism and loyalty to Western democracy. For Ham, freedom was not just a political right or opposition to communism—it was an inner moral and spiritual awakening that led individuals to live ethically, to think independently, and to act courageously in the face of oppression. He wrote: “We are not free because we oppose communism or support democracy. We are only free when we recognize our moral duty and stand before God and history with a clean conscience.” His critique extended to the institutional church. He condemned what he saw as the moral collapse of Korean Christianity, which, in his view, had sold out to power and wealth, becoming complicit in the systems of oppression. In his influential 1956 essay, What Is Korean Christianity Doing?, published in Sasang-gye magazine, he asked sharply why the church remained silent amid political corruption, poverty, and suffering. This article not only triggered fierce debates within the Christian community but also signaled Ham’s emergence as a leading prophetic voice.\n\nIt was during this time that Ham began developing his concept of the “Ssi-al” (씨알)—literally \"seed grain,\" but symbolically referring to the common people as bearers of spiritual and historical agency. He believed that the Ssi-al represented the conscience of the nation, the hidden vitality of history, and the only true basis for a just society. This idea was revolutionary in a time when national identity was largely framed through elites, political ideologies, or military strength. Ham’s vision of freedom and the Ssi-al intersected in his critique of power. He saw both communism and capitalism as materialist ideologies that reduced the human being to a tool of production or control. In contrast, he advocated for a human-centered society rooted in spiritual dignity, moral struggle, and personal responsibility. He also increasingly distanced himself from doctrinaire Christian exclusivism. Although deeply shaped by Christianity, Ham began to express religious pluralism in the 1950s. He read Hindu texts, engaged with Buddhist ideas, and studied Taoist and Confucian thought. His move toward a post-denominational and transcultural spirituality marked a turning point in his intellectual journey and prepared the ground for his embrace of Quakerism in the following decade.\n\nFurthermore, the 1950s saw Ham acting not only as a theorist but also as a public educator. He delivered lectures and sermons across Korea, seeking to awaken what he called the “sleeping conscience of the people.” He held that democratic revolution was only possible when ordinary people began to think critically and act morally. For Ham, this required education, inner transformation, and ethical leadership—not military coups or foreign intervention. By the end of the 1950s, Ham Seok-heon had effectively laid the foundation for a Korean democratic spirituality—a fusion of prophetic religion, ethical philosophy, and participatory social vision. His ideas directly influenced the democratic uprisings of the 1960s and later shaped the theological foundations of Korea’s minjung (people’s) movement in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\n김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim\n\n09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987\n\nThe 1950s marked Kim Jae-jun’s transformation from theologian to ecclesiastical reformer and public intellectual. In the aftermath of liberation from Japanese colonial rule and amid the traumatic consequences of the Korean War, the Korean Protestant Church was largely dominated by neo-orthodox conservatism. Kim opposed what he viewed as an \"anti-historical and anti-cultural orthodoxy,\" calling instead for a theology that was historically responsible, nationally conscious, and morally engaged with society.\n\nAfter the liberation in 1945, Kim resumed his leadership of Chosun Theological Seminary, which he had co-founded in 1940. Unlike the newly established Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Namsan, led by Park Hyung-ryong, Chosun Seminary embraced liberal theology and welcomed the historical-critical approach to biblical interpretation. Kim's insistence on biblical fallibility (biblical errancy) and theological openness led to increasing tension with conservative factions within the Presbyterian General Assembly. The controversy culminated in 1947 during the 33rd General Assembly with the so-called \"Statement of 51\" incident, in which 51 delegates submitted a petition denouncing Kim’s theology. Despite the theological nature of the dispute, the conflict became mired in regionalism and power struggles between northern and southern church leaders. The situation escalated when the General Assembly approved a new seminary (the Presbyterian Seminary) under Park Hyung-ryong in 1949, resulting in two rival seminaries under the same denomination.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the conflict intensified. In May 1952, the 37th General Assembly revoked the status of both seminaries as official theological institutions and instead decided to establish a new seminary in Daegu. However, the resolution collapsed amid protests from Chosun Seminary supporters. The Assembly refrained from formally disciplining Kim, instead delegating the decision to his regional presbytery. The presbytery, however, refused to comply and issued a public statement rejecting the General Assembly's ruling as unconstitutional. This rebellion against ecclesiastical authority received tacit support from foreign missions, including the Canadian Presbyterian Mission and the American Southern Presbyterian Mission. In 1952, amid growing polarization, Kim resumed publication of The Crusader (Sipjagun), a theological and socio-political magazine. It became a platform for articulating not only religious liberty and theological openness but also critiques of authoritarianism, social inequality, and reactionary nationalism. The Crusader positioned itself at the intersection of faith, conscience, and historical responsibility. \n\nIn 1953, at the 38th General Assembly in Daegu, Kim Jae-jun was officially defrocked on the grounds that he continued to promote “biblical errancy.” In response, Kim and his supporters formally separated and founded the Korean Christian Church (Kijang) in 1954 at the newly established Korea Theological College in Dongja-dong, Seoul. This was not merely a denominational split but a symbolic declaration of the right to religious conscience and theological freedom in the face of conservative church orthodoxy. Kim’s rejection of both reactionary nationalism and Cold War anti-communism set him apart from both the mainstream church and the state. Instead, he emphasized a vision of freedom rooted not in Western liberal ideology per se, but in a theological anthropology that centered on the dignity of the individual conscience before God. The founding of Kijang therefore institutionalized a church that sought to be prophetic rather than popular, free rather than doctrinally controlled, and socially responsible rather than spiritually escapist.\n\nThese struggles in the 1950s would lay the foundation for Kim’s subsequent development of a participatory theology and his leading role in Korea’s religious-based democratization movement in the decades that followed.\n\n\nPaul Roh Ki-nam 盧基南 노기남\n\n01/22/1902 ~ 06/25/1984\n\nDuring the 1950s, Archbishop Nogi Nam stood as a central figure not only in the Korean Catholic Church but also in the broader context of modern Korean history. With the Korean War erupting in 1950, he actively interpreted the conflict not simply as a civil war, but as an ideological struggle between communism and liberal democracy. This interpretation shaped his call for the faithful to resist communism with the spirit of martyrdom, framing the war as a battle for religious freedom and national identity.\n\nArchbishop Nam took a hands-on approach in politics, forming close ties with the U.S. military government and the South Korean government. He helped select political candidates, recommended right-wing leaders to the U.S. military, and played a critical role in the post-liberation ideological alignment of South Korea. He also utilized the Catholic press—particularly the revival of Kyunghyang Magazine and Kyunghyang Newspaper—as tools to promote anti-communist ideology and support the establishment of a democratic government.\n\nFollowing the Korean War, the Catholic population in Korea surged from approximately 170,000 in 1953 to over 530,000 by 1962. This was not only due to war-related displacement and the search for spiritual comfort but also to the Church’s increasingly visible role in national affairs. Archbishop Nam led efforts to expand the Church's structure by elevating vicariates to dioceses and founding educational institutions, most notably Sogang University. Despite his contributions, he faced political backlash, particularly from President Rhee Syngman's regime. Tensions with Rhee escalated due to Nam's support for Jang Myeon and his government's opposition. This culminated in the forced closure of Kyunghyang Newspaper in 1959. Nevertheless, Nam’s influence endured through the early 1960s, especially during the Second Republic and even after the 1961 military coup led by Park Chung-hee.\n\nIn essence, Archbishop Nogi Nam’s leadership in the 1950s laid the foundation for the Catholic Church’s growth and public presence in Korea. His pragmatic approach to social participation shaped the Church as not only a spiritual community but also a moral and ideological force in Korea’s nation-building era.\n\n\nTable 2.

Born in 1913 in Sycamore, Illinois, to Swedish immigrant parents, Swanson experienced a religious conversion at the Queen Anne Baptist Church in Seattle in 1923. He later became a traveling revivalist and served as a Baptist pastor for over a decade in Washington and Chicago. In July 1950, he resigned from his church to pursue a global evangelistic calling, which led him to war-torn Korea during the Korean War.\n\nHis encounter with the tragedy of war orphans in Korea became a turning point in his ministry. After visiting Daegu in 1952 and witnessing orphaned children suffering from hunger and neglect, Swanson felt compelled to act. A local missionary challenged him, saying, “Swanson, you’ve seen the need and the opportunities here—what will you do about it?” That question haunted him throughout his return flight to the U.S., leading him to vow his support for Korean children. \n\nRather than building a conventional missionary organization, Swanson envisioned a method of direct support. In 1952, he sent $1,000 through a local missionary to purchase a house in Bukpyeong, Gangwon Province—this became the first orphanage he supported, named Shin Ae Won (House of New Love). Over the next few years, he established or funded numerous other orphanages, often converting missionaries’ homes or church properties into shelters. By 1961, the number of orphanages he supported had grown to 113, aiding over 4,500 children. \n\nA transformative moment in Swanson’s work came in 1954, when he introduced the innovative \"one-to-one sponsorship\" model. This allowed an American family to directly sponsor a Korean child, providing $4 monthly for food, clothing, education, and spiritual care. Swanson wrote in his diary that he realized supporting an orphanage was not enough—\"we must invest in the whole person\"—and thus began to focus on holistic child development. \n\nIn 1956, Swanson formalized his work by establishing the Everett Swanson Evangelistic Association (ESEA), headquartered in Chicago. The organization, later renamed Compassion in 1963, reflected its new mission of “releasing children from poverty in Jesus’ name.” Inspired by Matthew 15:32, the name Compassion emphasized empathy and active care rather than institutional charity alone. \n\nCompassion’s work extended far beyond orphanage construction. The organization offered:\n\nMedical aid, including shipment of $1 million in supplies annually and direct medical support from staff nurses. \n\nVocational education, with schools for boys (farming in Gimpo) and girls (sewing, crafts, and English typing at the Youngjin Center). \n\nHigher education scholarships and study abroad programs, especially through partnerships with American evangelical foundations. \n\nSupport for local pastors, particularly those in remote areas or special ministries, reflecting the belief that strengthening the Korean church was essential for community rebuilding. \n\nThe WARM (Winter Aid Relief Money) project, which provided long coats and winter clothing to help children participate in normal seasonal activities, such as skating and snow play. \n\nAdoption assistance, which included screening adoptive parents for spiritual maturity. Compassion emphasized that adoptive parents be “born-again Christians.” \n\nSwanson died in November 1965 after a short battle with a brain tumor. His wife Miriam and missionary Henry Harvey continued the leadership of Compassion, which by then had become one of the “big four” Christian relief agencies in Korea alongside World Vision, CCF, and OMS. \n\n\n ",
