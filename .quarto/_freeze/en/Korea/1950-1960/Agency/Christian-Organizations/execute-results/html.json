Originating in 1946 in the aftermath of World War II, CWS was founded by a coalition of American Protestant denominations aiming to provide emergency relief to war-stricken populations in Europe and Asia. By 1951, CWS was formally incorporated as a department of the National Council of Churches (NCC) in the United States, representing over 30 member denominations, and gradually expanded its international operations to include Korea. Following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, CWS moved swiftly to organize its relief efforts. In July 1951, the Korea Church World Service (KCWS) was officially established as the Korean branch, with Edward Adams appointed as chair and Henry D. Appenzeller serving as general secretary. Registered with the United Nations Civil Assistance Command Korea (UNCACK), KCWS was able to legally import and distribute relief goods in cooperation with domestic missionary and social service organizations. Early relief efforts included the distribution of food, medicine, clothing, and essential supplies to war orphans, widows, refugees, and amputees—many of whom were victims of the war's devastation. CWS activities in Korea gradually transitioned from short-term aid to long-term development initiatives. While initially focused on emergency relief, CWS began integrating community development strategies into its programs by the mid-1950s. This shift aligned with broader international trends and U.S. foreign aid policy, particularly the emphasis on \"self-help\" and sustainable reconstruction. CWS supported medical rehabilitation projects, vocational training, orphanages, and technical schools. In addition, it collaborated with Korean Christian organizations such as the Union Christian Service Center (UCSC), YWCA, and YMCA, offering financial and material support while respecting local autonomy and leadership.\n\nOne of the most significant contributions of CWS during this period was its involvement in urban resettlement projects. In particular, the Eungam-dong Resettlement Project in 1958 exemplified how CWS expanded its activities to address the challenges of urban poverty and natural disaster relief. Following a devastating flood that displaced over 9,000 residents from the makeshift shantytown in Ichon-dong along the Han River, CWS collaborated with the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other international agencies such as the Catholic Relief Service (CRS) to relocate and rehouse flood victims. CWS played a central role in constructing temporary shelters, operating food kitchens, and providing building materials for permanent housing. Importantly, the project applied a self-help model, wherein residents were expected to participate in interior construction while the government and aid organizations handled infrastructure and structural work. Despite logistical delays and limitations in resources, this project was a milestone in Korea’s postwar urban welfare history, representing an early attempt to establish Christian community-based social development within a rapidly urbanizing context.\n\nThis endeavor also marked a significant expansion of CWS’s mission—from rural development to urban humanitarian intervention. It demonstrated a clear response to the growing needs of postwar Korean society, particularly as the population of Seoul surged and informal settlements proliferated. In this respect, CWS’s engagement in urban resettlement was not only practical but symbolically powerful, embodying the ecumenical spirit in action and pioneering a model of Christian social welfare that combined relief with reconstruction and advocacy. The philosophical underpinning of CWS’s work was deeply rooted in the Social Gospel tradition. While its activities aligned in part with the anti-communist orientation of U.S. Cold War policy, the mission of CWS went beyond geopolitical motives. It was driven by a theological commitment to social justice and compassion—viewing the alleviation of poverty, disease, and displacement as moral imperatives of the Christian faith. Through its partnership with Korean churches and communities, CWS fostered a sustainable framework that would later influence the rise of Korean Christian NGOs and faith-based development work in the decades to come. By the late 1960s, many of the programs initiated by CWS were gradually handed over to Korean organizations, such as the Korea Christian Service (KCS), reflecting a transition toward local ownership and self-sufficiency. This trajectory affirms the dual legacy of CWS in Korea: as both a provider of urgent humanitarian aid during a time of national crisis and as a catalyst for the indigenization of Christian social action and development.\n\n\nUnion Christian Service Center (UCSC) 기독교연합봉사회\n\n\nThe Union Christian Service Center (UCSC), established in Daejeon in 1949, was Korea’s first missionary-led ecumenical service organization founded in response to the postwar crisis and the devastation of the Korean War. Unlike other foreign aid agencies of the time, UCSC was not directed by a headquarters overseas; it was an autonomous initiative launched by missionaries from various denominations—including the Northern Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Salvation Army, and the United Church of Canada—who sought to embody Christian values through practical social engagement and reconstruction in Korea.\n\nFrom the beginning, UCSC went beyond mere relief work. Its mission was rooted in Christian ideals of justice, compassion, and empowerment. Central to its activities was the establishment of Christian rural leadership training schools—commonly known as Gospel Farmers' Schools —throughout the country. Starting in 1953 in Daejeon, the schools expanded to Hae-nam, Gwangju, Chuncheon, and Cheongju, providing six-month to year-long courses in modern agricultural techniques, cooperative management, leadership skills, and Christian ethics. Graduates of these programs returned to their villages as leaders capable of organizing and revitalizing their local communities. UCSC also operated model farms where modern agricultural methods—such as mechanized farming, improved fertilizers, and crop hybridization—were tested and taught. These farms served as living laboratories and community centers, enabling farmers to learn by doing. In addition, UCSC established clinics, rehabilitation centers, and vocational training workshops for war orphans, widows, amputees, and other marginalized groups. The prosthetics workshops and physical therapy programs pioneered by UCSC were especially innovative and largely unavailable elsewhere in Korea at the time. The organization placed special emphasis on empowering women and youth. Sewing classes, vocational programs, and literacy education for women were introduced in various regions. These efforts enabled women to gain financial independence and return to their communities as educators or volunteer leaders. While most foreign aid organizations of the time focused on children and male breadwinners, UCSC recognized women and youth as critical actors in rebuilding postwar society.\n\nUCSC’s success was also due to its strong collaborative networks. It maintained partnerships with the Korea Church World Service (KCWS), Christian Children’s Fund (CCF), YWCA, YMCA, and the Korea National Christian Council (KNCC), among others. These partnerships allowed for efficient distribution of resources and shared responsibility in community-based programs. For example, the Gospel Farmers' Schools were funded by KCWS, while women's education programs were co-managed with YWCA. Crucially, UCSC’s philosophy was not one of charity but of participation, education, and self-help. Rather than simply providing aid, UCSC empowered individuals and communities to identify their needs, build capacities, and take ownership of their recovery. This approach anticipated many of the participatory development and community organizing principles that would later define Korean NGOs and Christian civic movements. By the late 1950s, UCSC had established dozens of local centers across the country, each serving not only as a service facility but also as a hub for Christian community-building and grassroots empowerment. Its three-pronged strategy—leadership training, material support, and community organization—became a model for future Christian development work in Korea.\n\nIn sum, UCSC was one of the most innovative and holistic Christian mission-based social movements in postwar Korea. By integrating war relief, rural development, vocational training, rehabilitation services, and community organizing into a coherent ministry, UCSC not only addressed urgent needs but also laid the foundations for a long-term vision of Christian engagement with Korean society. Its legacy continues today as a foundational model for Christian social welfare and civic action.\n\n\nChristian Children’s Fund (CCF) 기독교아동복리회\n\n\nThe Christian Children’s Fund (CCF), originally founded in 1938 by American Presbyterian minister J. Calvitt Clarke, was one of the most active and influential foreign non-governmental organizations in Korea during and after the Korean War. Established with a vision to support children suffering from war and poverty across the globe, CCF began informal activities in Korea around 1948. Its efforts intensified dramatically after the outbreak of the Korean War, leading to its official registration as a foundation in 1955 under the name \"Christian Children’s Fund of Korea.\"\n\nDuring the 1950s, CCF focused primarily on direct aid to children and collaboration with local welfare institutions. Its signature initiative was a one-to-one sponsorship program that connected American sponsors with individual Korean children. This system, novel at the time in Korea, enabled consistent and personalized support in the form of food, clothing, medicine, educational materials, and emotional care. Letters, photographs, and gifts exchanged between sponsors and children fostered not only material assistance but also emotional bonds and a sense of connection to the outside world—a crucial factor in healing the psychological wounds left by war.\n\nCCF’s support extended far beyond orphanages. By partnering with over 250 childcare institutions nationwide, the organization offered comprehensive assistance including tuition, medical support, vocational training, hygiene education, and psychosocial counseling. It also established the CCF Korea Federation in 1953, a network that brought together directors of child welfare institutions across the country. This federation played a pivotal role in shaping Korea’s early social welfare infrastructure and helped to professionalize child welfare practices. CCF also published Donggwang, a professional journal for social workers, fostering the development of indigenous welfare theories and practices. In particular, CCF was deeply involved in the Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, where the devastation of war had left a significant number of orphans and impoverished children. Institutions such as the Gwangju Christian Nursery, Suncheon Gospel Nursery, and Yeosu Christian Nursery became key sites of CCF's involvement. These facilities, often established or run by local churches and missionaries, received financial and material support through CCF’s sponsorship model. The Gwangju Christian Nursery, for example, developed a long-term partnership with a church community in Louisiana, USA. Through this relationship, children not only received regular aid but also engaged in personal exchanges with their sponsors, forming enduring transnational relationships that strengthened their sense of identity and hope. CCF’s commitment to partnership with local institutions was evident in its efforts to strengthen the capabilities of childcare workers. It regularly held training seminars and leadership workshops for local welfare administrators in the Honam region, which helped fill the vacuum in formal social work education at the time. CCF also developed mobile distribution systems to deliver food, clothing, and educational supplies to children living outside of institutions, particularly in isolated rural areas. This flexible and inclusive approach extended the reach of child welfare services to those who were often excluded from traditional welfare systems.\n\nBy the late 1950s, CCF had become a de facto pillar of Korea’s child welfare system. At a time when government funding for child welfare was minimal—accounting for only 26.8% of facility budgets in 1957—foreign aid made up 32.8%, with CCF as one of the largest contributors. As the 1960s progressed, foreign aid surpassed 50% of funding in the sector. In this context, CCF functioned not merely as a relief organization but as a substitute welfare provider in the absence of state capacity. Its efforts laid the groundwork for Korea’s eventual transition toward a more institutionalized and professionalized welfare system. The legacy of CCF in 1950s Korea is threefold. First, it established a systematic, sustainable approach to child welfare through its sponsorship and institutional support model. Second, it contributed to the formation and professionalization of Korea’s social welfare workforce through education, networking, and publication. Third, it provided a transitional framework for Korea’s welfare system at a time when the state was unable to fulfill this role. CCF’s welfare philosophy emphasized holistic care and dignity, not charity. Through personalized support, institutional partnerships, and grassroots empowerment, it shaped a new paradigm of child welfare in Korea. The Gwangju and Jeolla region examples are representative of how CCF’s impact extended beyond urban centers and into rural communities across the nation. These regional efforts underscore the organization’s commitment to building localized, sustainable models of care that reflected the complex needs of postwar Korean society. Ultimately, the Christian Children’s Fund played a leading role in developing Korea’s child welfare system during one of the most vulnerable periods in its modern history. Its work went beyond relief—it built structures, nurtured communities, and empowered children and caregivers alike. Its legacy lives on today through its successor organization, ChildFund Korea (formerly Korea Christian Children's Fund), one of the largest child welfare NGOs in the country.\n\n\nYWCA\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the YWCA of Korea played a pivotal role in Christian women's activism through a range of practical efforts aimed at supporting women, children, and local communities during the national crises of liberation and the Korean War. Organizationally, it resumed activities that had been halted under Japanese colonial rule, and in 1947 sent a delegation of ten women to the World YWCA Council in Hangzhou, China. This marked a major step in re-establishing Korea YWCA as an independent actor within the international women’s movement. When the Korean War broke out, the YWCA immediately mobilized to provide relief for refugees, war orphans, and widows. Branches in Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, and other cities opened their centers as shelters, hosting hundreds of refugees daily and distributing food and clothing. They also founded orphanages, offered child care, and supported the livelihoods of single mothers and war widows. For example, Daejeon YWCA provided shelter to more than 150 people per day, while Gwangju YWCA, led by General Secretary Jo Ah-ra, established a nursery to offer practical support to women and children in the region.\n\nSimultaneously, the YWCA provided vocational training and education to support women's self-reliance. Women were taught practical skills such as sewing, cooking, and household management to help them achieve economic independence. Leadership training for women was also emphasized, enabling them to become active participants in social life. Youth and student programs continued through Bible study and cultural activities, and student groups were organized to train young leaders. Even amidst war, these initiatives helped foster a sense of community and moral values among the next generation.\n\nEsther Park, who served as a senior advisor, acted as a civilian diplomat while staying in the United States during the war. She reached out to the World YWCA and the United Nations to inform them about Korea’s desperate situation and request assistance. In an article for the World YWCA bulletin, she wrote that \"we cannot just sit and cry,\" emphasizing hope and a sense of responsibility despite the devastation. Her international outreach contributed greatly to securing humanitarian support from abroad. In addition to relief work, the YWCA also conducted educational programs for women in rural areas, promoted local welfare initiatives, and operated programs to instill democratic civic values. Through all of these activities, the YWCA established itself not merely as a Christian women's organization but as a community committed to social responsibility. Rooted in Christian faith, its efforts helped restore families, support women, and rebuild communities in a war-torn society, laying the foundation for the broader social movements of the 1960s and 1970s.
