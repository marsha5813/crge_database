Churches were not only physically destroyed—541 Presbyterian churches, 239 Methodist churches, 106 Holiness churches, and 4 Salvation Army churches were either damaged or completely lost —but thousands of pastors and believers were killed, and the Christian faith itself was tested by ideological betrayal and persecution.\n\nInternational Christian organizations, particularly from the United States, extended large-scale humanitarian aid, including food, clothing, and medical supplies. The Church World Service alone distributed over 23 million pounds of food and nearly a million pounds of clothing by 1959. This support laid the groundwork for rebuilding churches, providing care for war widows, orphans, and the disabled, and reviving the Christian mission in Korea.\n\nWithin the church, the war exposed theological and ethical fault lines. While some Christian leaders compromised with North Korean authorities, others paid with their lives for remaining faithful. This reality led to a period of profound repentance and spiritual renewal. Notable evangelistic gatherings, such as Billy Graham’s rallies in Busan (1952) and Seoul (1956), became pivotal moments for the restoration of the Christian spirit and public witness.\n\nAt the same time, Korean churches pursued aggressive evangelistic efforts. The Presbyterian Church designated 1952 as “the year of evangelism” and implemented a four-stage strategy—personal renewal, personal evangelism, cooperative outreach, and church-based campaigns. This resulted in the establishment of over 2,050 new churches by 1955 across denominations including Presbyterian, Methodist, and Holiness churches.\n\nThe church also responded to the widespread social crisis. Welfare initiatives included the Holt Adoption Program, which sent over 2,000 orphans to adoptive families in the U.S. by 1959, and prosthetics and rehabilitation services for war veterans and civilians. Christian organizations built orphanages, homes for widows, rehabilitation centers, and hospitals. Figures like Torrey and John Steensma were instrumental in providing prosthetics and employment for the disabled.\n\nChristian schools played a key role in the national recovery. Institutions such as Soongsil, Ewha, and Yonsei reopened or relocated to South Korea, resuming higher education under Christian leadership. Informal education programs—including literacy classes, Bible clubs, and correspondence Bible courses—contributed both to Christian formation and national literacy campaigns.\n\nOne of the most groundbreaking developments was the introduction of the military chaplaincy system, initiated in 1951 by President Syngman Rhee. By 1955, over 330 military chaplains were serving across the Korean armed forces. Christian outreach even extended to prisoners of war: approximately 60,000 POWs converted to Christianity, and many refused repatriation to North Korea.\n\nThus, the church reconstruction movement in 1950s Korea was far more than a rebuilding of church buildings—it was a holistic endeavor to restore faith, heal a war-torn society, and spread the gospel. This period laid the spiritual and institutional foundations for the explosive growth of Korean Christianity in the decades that followed.\n\nChristian Family Life Movement 기독교여성가정생활운동\n\n\nThe Christian Family Life Movement in 1950s Korea emerged from the Christian community’s conscious effort to rebuild families amid the upheavals of liberation and the Korean War. In a society devastated by war, the family was seen as the starting point for rebuilding and as the foundation for restoring the national community. Christianity aimed to restore society’s moral and ethical order through the recovery of Christian families. In this context, Korean Christians participated in the East Asia Christian Family Life Conference held in Manila, Philippines, in November 1954. Inspired by the conference, they returned to Korea and launched the Christian Family Life Movement in earnest. In February 1955, the Christian Family Life Committee was officially established under the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK). Drawing from the Christian Family Life Movement already active in the United States, Europe, and Asia, the committee began to implement programs to instill Christian values in Korean homes. The movement emphasized the “integration of faith and life,” advocating that the Christianization of the family was essential for the moral and spiritual recovery of postwar Korean society. Educational programs were conducted nationwide, targeting churches, schools, and universities. These included lectures on Christian ethics, premarital guidance, child-rearing, and marriage counseling. At the heart of the movement was the Christian monthly magazine New Home (Saegajeong), which served not merely as a religious publication but as a practical guide for everyday family life. The magazine systematized and disseminated the theory of Christian family life, addressing topics such as marital relationships, parenting, sexual ethics, and household responsibilities from a Christian perspective. It promoted the ideal of a rational and scientifically minded housewife—an educated, responsible, and faith-driven woman who managed the household efficiently and faithfully.\n\nWhile emphasizing women’s role in the home, the movement also idealized motherhood and the moral authority of women within the family. Women were viewed as central to the transmission and embodiment of Christian ethics, both as mothers and as wives. Although this promoted a somewhat progressive image of women as active agents, it also reinforced traditional gender roles by situating their influence primarily within the domestic sphere. New Home also emphasized Christian views on love, chastity, and marriage, particularly targeting young adults with messages about premarital purity, lifelong marital fidelity, and the sacredness of the family covenant. Beyond the private sphere, the movement regarded the Christian family as a building block of the nation. Establishing sound Christian homes was seen as foundational to national reconstruction. The family was viewed as a training ground for democracy, freedom, responsibility, and moral order. With this vision, the movement became a cross-denominational effort, uniting various Christian groups around the shared goal of shaping a moral and faithful society through the household.\n\nThe Christian Family Life Movement of the 1950s, then, was not only a spiritual or religious initiative but also a cultural and social campaign that responded to the moral disarray of postwar Korea. By promoting Christian values in everyday life, it aimed to heal the broken social fabric and guide the people toward a better future. While the movement retained some limitations, especially in its reinforcement of conventional gender norms, it nevertheless played a formative role in shaping postwar Korean society and laid important groundwork for later developments in women’s welfare, family planning, and Christian social ethics.\n\nThe South Korean Military Chaplaincy\n\n\n The South Korean military chaplaincy of the 1950s was more than a matter of religious service within the armed forces. It functioned as a political and ideological apparatus tightly interwoven with the anti-communist agenda of President Syngman Rhee’s regime. The institutionalization of Christian chaplaincy during the Korean War was central to state efforts to forge legitimacy, mobilize ideology, and establish close ties between religion and national identity. Based on the two provided academic articles, this analysis offers a detailed account of how military chaplaincy emerged and operated during this pivotal decade.\n\nFollowing Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, South Korean society experienced a severe deficit of political legitimacy. Former collaborators with Japanese imperial rule continued to hold positions of power, and economic inequality deepened amidst political repression. President Syngman Rhee’s government, though outwardly promoting “freedom and democracy,” functioned in an authoritarian manner. To address its ideological void and consolidate authority, the regime strategically embraced Christianity, particularly Protestantism, as a foundational moral and ideological force.\n\nBy the late 1940s and early 1950s, Christianity had already become embedded in the upper echelons of South Korean politics. Many Protestant leaders were northern refugees who had fled religious persecution under the North Korean communist regime. They brought with them a fervent anti-communism and a readiness to align with the southern government. These church leaders, together with American missionaries, became instrumental in shaping South Korea’s emerging ideological and moral culture. Christianity was not only a spiritual force but also a symbolic bond between South Korea and the United States—its most important Cold War ally. In September 1950, just months after the Korean War broke out, the Committee for the Advancement of the Establishment of Chaplaincy in the Korean Army was formed. It included key American missionaries such as George Carroll and prominent Korean Protestant leaders like Han Kyung-jik and Yoo Hyung-ki. On February 7, 1951, a Military Religion Bureau was officially created within the personnel department of the South Korean Army. Drawing from American models, chaplains were initially civilians funded by their own denominations. They were later granted salaried and commissioned officer status by 1954. Chaplains did far more than offer religious comfort. They preached anti-communism, offered moral training, and worked to convert soldiers to Christianity—often equating Christian belief with loyalty to the South Korean state. In prisons and POW camps like the one on Geoje Island, missionaries such as Harold Voelkel and his Korean associates converted tens of thousands of North Korean prisoners. It is estimated that by 1952, more than 15,000 prisoners had become Christians, and a large number chose not to be repatriated to the North. These religious activities were also psychological and political tools used to transform potential adversaries into allies. By 1954, approximately 20% of South Korean soldiers were Christians—mostly Protestants—a stark contrast to the general population, where Christians made up only about 2%. Protestant churches rapidly constructed field churches within military units, and new converts remained loyal to their denominations after discharge, boosting church membership and influence in civilian society.\n\nMeanwhile, Korean Buddhism was largely excluded from the military chaplaincy during this period. Institutional Buddhism had suffered from its perceived collaboration with Japanese imperialism, a lack of international support, and internal divisions. Although some monks independently carried out religious activities—distributing amulets, holding funerals, and preaching Buddhist teachings—the government rejected formal petitions to include Buddhist chaplains. Despite these challenges, some Buddhist leaders, particularly in the southern regions around Busan, attempted to build informal military Buddhist communities with the support of sympathetic officers. These monks appealed to Korean nationalism by referencing traditional Silla-era military ideals, particularly the Hwarang spirit and the Five Commandments of the Buddhist master Won’gwang, which emphasized loyalty, courage, and battlefield virtue. Still, these efforts had limited institutional support and failed to counter the state’s clear preference for Christianity. In the end, Buddhist participation in military religious life was informal, fragmented, and subordinate to a Christian-dominated system. \n\nThus, military chaplaincy in 1950s South Korea was not merely a spiritual service but a tool of state-building and ideological mobilization. It served to legitimize the regime, strengthen military discipline, and promote Christianity as a national ideology. This fusion of state power and Protestant influence helped Christianity to grow rapidly and gain cultural dominance in postwar South Korea. Meanwhile, Buddhism, though still the religion of many rural and lay Koreans, remained institutionally marginalized until the 1960s and 1970s, when it began to make more formal inroads into military and state structures.\n\n\nNon-Church Movement\n\n\nThe Non-Church Movement emerged in 1950s Korea as a distinctive religious praxis that challenged both ecclesiastical institutions and state ideology, offering instead an ethic grounded in Scripture and communal life. Rather than merely rejecting institutional churches, the leaders of this movement sought to embody the essence of the gospel in social and ethical terms, especially in the midst of postwar national trauma. Kim Kyo-shin and Ham Seok-heon, along with their successors such as Ryu Daryeong and Lee Chan-gap, broadened the theoretical and practical horizons of Korean Christianity beyond institutional boundaries.\n\nKim Kyo-shin, the ideological foundation-layer of the movement, famously declared that “there is salvation outside the Church,” emphasizing a personal, scripture-centered faith rooted in ethical living. He stated, “Talk of the afterlife does not comfort me—it only breeds frustration or outrage,” adding, “What I seek is not sanctification after death, nor promises of heaven, but to reach completeness even for a single day in this body and life”. This reflects his conviction that true faith must manifest in the present world, not in eschatological speculation.\n\nThis spirit was inherited by Ham Seok-heon, who expanded Non-Church thought into historical philosophy and Minjung theology from the mid-1950s onward. In 1958, he was arrested for his political commentary in Sasang-gye, a pivotal moment that marked his resistance to both church and state authority. For Ham, the Minjung (common people) were not merely the oppressed masses, but the historical subjects through whom God’s will would unfold: “Within the word ‘Minjung’ lies a desperate hope for the historical agency of the lowest and most powerless people”. This idea would later evolve into his famed Ssi-al (Seed) philosophy.\n\nHam’s thought transcended denominational boundaries, drawing upon Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism in an effort to overcome the exclusivism of modern religion. His Ssi-al concept captured this vision: “Ssi-al are the lowest, most neglected people of this land... but they are the real agents who will transform it”. Between the late 1950s and early 1960s, he developed this theory into a complete framework of civic subjectivity, later known as citizen discourse.\n\nThis philosophical current was carried into practice by Ryu Daryeong, whose 1954 book For a New History presented the Danish folk high school and cooperative movements as a Christian model for Korea’s rural transformation. The book became immensely influential, undergoing dozens of printings, and laid the groundwork for his appointment in 1961 as the first director of the National Reconstruction Movement. Ryu later wrote that he “hung a large photo of Grundtvig on [his] wall and looked at it in prayer each morning before leaving for work”.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee Chan-gap, a direct disciple of Kim Kyo-shin, founded the Pulmu School in 1958, bringing Non-Church ideals into the realm of alternative education. Inspired by the Osan School legacy and the Danish folk high school model, he centered the curriculum on “the language and history of the people.” The Pulmu School is considered a living realization of the Non-Church emphasis on self-reliance, ethical community, and faith-based education.\n\nUltimately, the Non-Church Movement of the 1950s was not simply a rejection of institutional Christianity—it was an embodied experiment in prophetic witness, communal education, and alternative nationhood. Ham Seok-heon’s Ssi-al theology represents its ideological flowering, while Ryu and Lee’s work demonstrate the movement’s practical reach. These figures stood at the margins of both state and church, striving instead to forge a faithful path rooted in Scripture, peoplehood, and historical agency. In doing so, the Non-Church Movement became a significant waypoint in modern Korean Christianity’s journey toward liberation, education, and radical ethical engagement.\n\n\nTable 1.
