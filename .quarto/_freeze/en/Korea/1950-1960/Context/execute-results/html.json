Among these, religion emerged as both a cultural force and a mechanism of governance. Under President Syngman Rhee, whose political vision was deeply rooted in Protestant Christianity, the religious policy of the First Republic reveals a dual structure: the promotion of Christianity as a core national identity and the state's strategic involvement in managing other religious communities. This paper provides an objective analysis of the First Republic's religious policies, particularly focusing on the institutional promotion of Christianity and the state's role in shaping the religious landscape of post-liberation Korea.\n\nThe 1948 Constitution of the Republic of Korea enshrined the principle of religious freedom and the separation of religion and state (Article 20). However, in practice, the Rhee administration implemented a range of policies that strongly favored Christianity, particularly Protestantism, while engaging selectively with other religious traditions. This gap between constitutional ideals and practical governance reveals the complex interplay of ideology, religion, and statecraft in early Korean democracy.\n\nPresident Rhee, educated and baptized in the United States, viewed Christianity as not only a personal faith but also a civilizational foundation for national development. In his 1945 speech at Jeongdong First Methodist Church, he stated his intention to \"build the nation on the Bible.\" This vision materialized in symbolic and institutional forms: Christian rituals were adopted in the 1948 National Assembly opening and presidential inauguration, and Protestant leaders like Rev. Lee Yoon-young played ceremonial roles in state functions.\n\nInstitutionally, Christianity was embedded into various sectors:\n\nThe military chaplain system and prison ministry (hyeongmok system) were implemented, primarily under Protestant and Catholic leadership.\n\nChristian media institutions such as CBS (1954) and Far East Broadcasting Company (1956) were established with state approval.\n\nNumerous high-level government officials were practicing Christians, creating a visible religious preference in governance.\n\nChristian lawmakers were significantly represented in the Constituent Assembly (estimated 21–24% of members), disproportionately high compared to the national Christian population at the time (0.5–2%).\n\n\nChristianity became aligned with the state’s ideological opposition to communism, especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The persecution of Christians in North Korea, including the martyrdom of figures such as Rev. Son Yang-won, was highlighted to construct Christianity as a bulwark of anti-communism and moral resistance. Churches and Christian institutions supported state campaigns in education, military morale, and national reconstruction.\n\nChristian groups also supported land reform policies. Rhee's 1949–50 land reform, which dismantled the landlord-tenant structure of colonial Korea and transitioned tenant farmers into landowners, was positively evaluated from a Christian worldview emphasizing economic justice and love-based governance. The land reform reduced inequality and contributed to the foundation of economic modernization.\n\n\nWhile Christianity received state endorsement, other religions experienced selective engagement, state-led reform, and in some cases, coercive control. In 1954, amid conflict between celibate (bigu) monks and married clergy (daecheo seung), the Rhee administration issued the \"Purification Edict,\" recognizing the former as legitimate. While the edict facilitated institutional reform and monastic consolidation, it also constituted an unconstitutional state intervention, as condemned by the National Assembly.The state's involvement set a precedent for political entanglement in Buddhist affairs that reverberated into the late 20th century.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1964, the Confucian community was divided between the 'Nong-eun' and 'Orthodox' factions. Although a Christian, Rhee was endorsed as president of the Confucian Yudohoe by the Nong-eun group. His acceptance contributed to the marginalization of traditional leaders like Kim Chang-sook and raised concerns about religious neutrality in governance.\n\nEmergent religious movements were often labeled as \"pseudo-religions\" or \"heresies\" and subjected to police surveillance or outright suppression. In several cases, leaders of new religious groups were arrested, and their organizations forcibly disbanded, in contravention of constitutional protections.\n\nA notable area of church-state conflict was the dispute over mandatory flag salutes (kukgi baerye), particularly in Presbyterian circles. Rooted in a historical resistance to Shinto shrine worship under Japanese rule, some Christians interpreted the bowing to the national flag as a form of idolatry. Prominent Christian leaders, such as Rev. Sohn Yang-won and Pastor Lee Won-young, publicly opposed the practice, leading to legal and social confrontations between churches and schools enforcing patriotic rituals.\n\nThe First Republic's religious policies enabled the rapid institutional growth of Christianity and its integration into state ideology. Simultaneously, these policies disrupted the autonomy of other religious traditions and weakened their internal governance. While Christianity benefited from state support, it also became entangled with political power, leading to long-term challenges in maintaining religious neutrality and public trust.\n\nThe religious policy of the First Republic was a complex system shaped by the theological convictions of its leadership, the exigencies of Cold War politics, and the sociopolitical restructuring of post-colonial Korea. Christianity was not merely favored but structurally embedded in the state's vision of modernization and anti-communism. Conversely, the state's interventions in Buddhism, Confucianism, and new religions illustrate how religious diversity was managed through selective support and strategic control. These dynamics have left a lasting imprint on the relationship between religion and state in South Korea.\n\n\nTable 1.

Christian leaders like Cho Man-sik were viewed as advocates of democratic order. In October 1945, Kim Il Sung reportedly instructed Kang Ryang-uk, “Bring progressive and influential pastors and elders into the fold, so that Christians will gain correct awareness of our righteous cause for building a new democratic Korea.” As a result, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) was founded in Pyongyang on November 28, 1946, with Kang Ryang-uk as chairman. The KCF's platform declared its goal to “awaken patriotism based on Christian principles of love and to participate in the national construction project.” However, internally, the KCF was a tool for weakening and absorbing the independent church. According to Kim Yang-sun, a pastor who defected to the South, the KCF's real purpose was to “foment internal division and drive the church to self-destruction.”\n\n\nRegime Establishment and War Period (1948–1953): Systematic Persecution and Emergence of the Underground Church\n\nAfter the establishment of the DPRK in 1948, Christianity was redefined as a “remnant of imperialist ideology” and associated with American espionage. During the Korean War, Christians were accused of collaborating with UN forces, leading to mass arrests, executions, and forced disappearances. Pastor Yoo Sahyun, who defected to the South in 1952, recalled that “five or six believers gathered in secret, shedding tears in prayer,” indicating the shift of religious life into secrecy. Following the war, the equation “Christian = spy” became entrenched, and even home-based religious activity was criminalized and surveilled. Incidents such as the hymnal case in Pakcheon County (1959) and the cross incident at Wonsan Railway Factory (1960) show that some believers still tried to worship in secret.\n\n\nPostwar Era (1953–1960): Atheism Campaigns and Dismantling of Public Religion\n\nAfter the war, the North Korean regime initiated a comprehensive atheism campaign. The book Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959) by Chong Ha-chol defined Christianity as “a belief in divine power that undermines socialist construction by replacing self-effort with the will of God.” The 1957 Iman-hwa case in Yongcheon County—where a pastor was prosecuted for refusing to vote—illustrates how Christian dissent was framed as anti-socialist behavior. As a result, “all official Christian activity in North Korea ceased between 1958 and 1972.” During this period, Christianity survived only as a clandestine faith practiced in underground networks, many of which were infiltrated or dissolved.\n\n\nTable 2.

Religious institutions, especially Protestant churches, supported the regime and became entwined with state-led anti-communist campaigns.\n\nIn the North, the state pursued the \"Democratic Base Theory”a strategy to export socialist revolution from the North to the South. Christianity was violently suppressed as a pro-American and counter-revolutionary force. Thousands of pastors and believers fled to the South or were imprisoned. The Korean Christian Federation (Josŏn Kidokkyo-do Yŏnmaeng) was established in 1946 to serve as a nominal religious body under state control. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nHostility toward Christianity in 1950s Korean society cannot be understood simply as a manifestation of anti-religious sentiment or interreligious conflict. Rather, it emerged out of a complex historical context shaped by liberation, national division, and war, during which Christianity became deeply entangled in politics, society, and culture. In this period, Christianity played a central role in postwar recovery and humanitarian efforts but was also criticized for its association with foreign powers, monopolization of authority, and internal factionalism.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Korean War, Christian churches—particularly those led by northern refugees affiliated with the Presbyterian Church—took the lead in relief and reconstruction efforts. Through close partnerships with American missionaries and church networks, they secured significant amounts of aid and humanitarian resources. This positioned them as key power brokers in both the church and society. However, this monopolization of aid and leadership led to conflict with other Christian groups, especially those from the Koryŏ-sin (Ko-Shin) and Chosŏn Theological Seminary (KiJang) traditions. These groups were marginalized, often accused of heresy, and pushed out of mainstream denominational structures. As a result, Christianity came to be seen by the public not as a moral or spiritual community but as an exclusive and power-driven institution. Another source of criticism was the church’s close association with foreign powers, particularly the United States. American churches and missionaries supported Korea’s Christians with money, personnel, and material aid, but this also reinforced the image of Christianity as foreign, Western, and anti-communist. This perception contributed to a growing belief that Christianity was aligned with U.S. imperial interests and the anti-communist agenda of the Syngman Rhee government. For nationalist intellectuals and youth disillusioned by American influence, Christianity appeared complicit in foreign domination. Moreover, the collaboration between Christian leaders and the authoritarian regime under Syngman Rhee added to this negative perception. Church figures often supported Rhee’s anti-communist rhetoric and were publicly praised by the government. This blurred the lines between political and religious authority, further reinforcing the belief that the church was entangled with state power.\n\nDespite these criticisms, it would be inaccurate to dismiss the role of Christianity in Korean society during this period as entirely negative. Many missionaries and Korean Christian leaders engaged in genuine humanitarian work: caring for refugees, providing medical services, operating orphanages and widow shelters, and rebuilding war-torn communities. American churches led national campaigns to raise funds and send aid to Korea. These efforts not only alleviated suffering but also helped lay the foundations for modern social welfare and education systems in South Korea. In the long run, Christianity contributed to the internalization of democratic values, civic ethics, and the development of civil society in the postwar era. Christianity, by virtue of its visibility and influence, inevitably drew both praise and criticism. Its rise to prominence amid national trauma and reconstruction created tensions across social groups, generating a complex mixture of trust and hostility. However, this hostility was not born of blind rejection. It was a reflection of Christianity’s historical positioning—as a moral force, political actor, and cultural mediator—in a society undergoing radical transformation. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nSouth Korea\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, South Korea’s diplomatic, religious, and national identity evolved in dynamic and often turbulent ways, with Christianity playing a central role in shaping both domestic and international relationships. During this time, the country’s interactions with neighboring Asian-Pacific states, particularly North Korea, China, and Japan, and with Christian-majority nations such as the United States and Canada, were deeply influenced by religious, political, and ideological factors. Concurrently, expressions of nationalism and patriotism emerged in complex forms, often interwoven with Christian sentiment, public rituals, and anti-communist ideology.\n\nAfter liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, South Korea’s relationship with North Korea quickly devolved into ideological opposition that culminated in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The war marked a defining moment in the South’s assertion of identity, with Christianity positioned as a moral and spiritual force against atheistic communism. In the North, Christian churches were suppressed and believers persecuted; pastors were arrested, churches were closed, and many Christians fled to the South. Estimates suggest that two-thirds of the clergy in North Korea relocated southward, where they contributed to the growth of the Christian community. For missionaries and South Korean leaders alike, the war was not merely a military conflict but also a religious and civilizational struggle. The perceived clash between a Christian South and a communist North elevated the role of Christianity in state ideology and contributed to the consolidation of national unity under the banner of anti-communism. \n\nSouth Korea’s postwar stance toward Japan was largely shaped by historical resentment stemming from its colonial past. While diplomatic ties remained limited during this period, Christian institutions benefited from this estrangement. American and Canadian missionaries, in particular, were viewed as symbols of non-colonial benevolence in contrast to Japanese imperial oppression. This perception bolstered the legitimacy and influence of Christian missions in Korea, especially in rural and war-torn regions. During the war, Japan also functioned as a logistical and temporary humanitarian base for missionaries who were evacuated from the peninsula. Canadian and American missionaries stationed in Seoul and other cities fled to Japan in the early days of the conflict, only to return later to continue relief and evangelistic work.\n\nChina’s involvement in the Korean War further complicated South Korea’s regional relationships. Before the Chinese entry into the war in late 1950, some missionaries held out hope that Christian work might continue on the mainland. However, China’s intervention dashed such expectations, positioning the Chinese Communist regime as a clear adversary of South Korean Christianity. American and Canadian missionaries interpreted China’s actions not just as military aggression but as part of a broader communist threat to the Christian presence in Asia. As China became more closely aligned with North Korea, the ideological and theological divide in East Asia became more pronounced.\n\nSouth Korea’s relationship with the United States during this period was marked by deep military, political, and religious cooperation. American Protestant missionaries had laid the groundwork for Christianity in Korea since the late 19th century, establishing schools, hospitals, and churches that became pivotal institutions in Korean society. During the Korean War, this relationship deepened. The United States, through the United Nations Command, became South Korea’s primary military protector. Simultaneously, American churches, missionaries, and Christian organizations mobilized spiritual and material support for Korea, presenting the conflict as a defense of Christian civilization. The World Council of Churches formally condemned North Korea’s aggression and endorsed the UN military action, reinforcing the belief that the war was a moral as well as political battle. American missionaries often served as chaplains to Korean troops and civilians, helping to interpret the war through a Christian lens and providing essential humanitarian aid in the midst of destruction.\n\nCanada also maintained significant missionary and theological ties with Korea. Canadian missionaries had been active in northern Korea since the early 20th century, especially in Hamheung and the surrounding provinces. Following the division of Korea and the rise of communism in the North, Canadian missionaries hoped to return to their former mission fields, but the war and political changes made that impossible. Nevertheless, Canadian missionaries continued to support Korean Christians through their work in Seoul and southern regions, often ministering to northern refugees. Figures such as Florence Murray played leading roles in wartime medical and relief work, while others maintained educational and theological ministries despite repeated evacuations. These missionaries saw in Korea not only a spiritual calling but also a strategic battleground in the fight against communism, echoing broader Cold War sentiments prevalent in Western churches.\n\nExpressions of nationalism and patriotism during this era were deeply intertwined with Christian ideology. After liberation, the growth of Christian schools, hospitals, and churches was not only a matter of religious development but also a nationalistic endeavor. Mission schools like Ewha Girls’ School and Pai Chai Haktang became centers of civic awakening and national pride. Their curricula emphasized not just religious instruction but also liberal arts education, physical training, and public speaking, all intended to develop leaders for an independent Korean nation. Students participated in national ceremonies and were often involved in pro-independence movements. Christianity thus played a formative role in shaping a modern, educated, and politically conscious Korean identity.\n\nDuring the Korean War, nationalism was often expressed through religious symbols and rituals. Revival meetings, mass prayer gatherings, and public confessions of sin took on patriotic overtones. The church became both a refuge from war and a space for the cultivation of national spirit. Sermons often fused biblical narratives with themes of national suffering and redemption. Christian leaders emphasized that faith in Christ and loyalty to the nation were mutually reinforcing commitments. Public mourning for the war dead, prayers for national survival, and acts of charity were seen not only as Christian duties but as patriotic acts. In this context, the border between religious devotion and civic nationalism became increasingly blurred. The press and public discourse during this decade also reflected these sentiments. Newspapers and Christian publications described Korea as a “chosen nation” destined to resist communism and lead Asia in spiritual renewal. Anti-communist propaganda often relied on religious metaphors, and many church leaders were celebrated as national heroes. Christianity, especially Protestantism, was portrayed as a modernizing force capable of saving Korea from both its feudal past and the threat of totalitarianism. Even secular leaders like President Syngman Rhee, himself a devout Christian, invoked Christian rhetoric to frame national policy and foreign relations.\n\nIn summary, between 1945 and 1960, South Korea’s relationships with neighboring countries and Christian-majority nations were shaped not only by military and political factors but also by deep religious convictions. Christianity provided a framework through which Koreans interpreted war, occupation, independence, and national purpose. American and Canadian missionaries were more than religious figures; they were builders of civil society, allies in ideological warfare, and participants in Korea’s national drama. In return, Korean Christians embraced faith as both a spiritual refuge and a patriotic duty, contributing to the remarkable expansion of Christianity during a time of national trauma and transformation.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nIn the 1950s, Christianity in North Korea was not merely perceived as a religious practice but rather as a fundamental threat to the regime. This perception was deeply shaped by North Korea's diplomatic relations with neighboring countries and the broader international climate. Following liberation, North Korea, under the strong influence of the Soviet Union, quickly adopted a socialist system and embraced an atheistic ideology, which fundamentally rejected religion as antithetical to state ideology. Christianity, particularly, was seen as a symbol of Western civilization tied to the United States, which led North Korean authorities to brand it as an extension of imperialism and a tool of counterrevolution.\n\nThe relationship with the Soviet Union played a foundational role in shaping North Korea’s religious policies. As the North modeled its state apparatus on Stalinist socialism, religion was completely rejected and categorized as superstition. To ensure ideological conformity and social unity, churches were shut down and Christians were labeled as spies or reactionaries. Clergy and believers often ended up in labor camps or faced public execution. This ideological alignment with the Soviet model provided the justification for systemic religious persecution.\n\nNorth Korea's relations with China also significantly impacted its policy toward religion. During the Korean War, China's military intervention through the People's Volunteer Army was pivotal to North Korea's survival. This event led to closer strategic cooperation between the two nations. At the same time, China was suppressing Christianity as a remnant of bourgeois influence, especially during the lead-up to the Cultural Revolution. North Korea and China thus shared a common stance on religion and coordinated their efforts to eliminate Christianity, treating it as a hindrance to the construction of socialist ideology.\n\nHostility toward the United States further intensified the repression of Christianity. As North Korea's most prominent adversary, the U.S. was viewed not only as a military threat but also as a cultural and ideological one. Christianity, associated with American influence, was treated as a subversive force. Christians were accused of being collaborators with U.S. forces or South Korean intelligence, and religious activities were treated as acts of treason. Churches were closed, Bibles were burned, and many believers went underground. Persecution was not solely due to religious beliefs, but because Christianity was framed as a tool of American imperialism.\n\nIn relation to Japan, North Korea kept a close watch on Korean Christian communities among Zainichi Koreans. Many of these communities were centered around churches in Japan. However, the North saw Christian churches as a threat to ideological unity and attempted to control religious activity through pro-Pyongyang organizations like Chongryon. Religious organizations were sidelined in favor of ideological education through Korean schools, reflecting Pyongyang’s effort to neutralize Christianity’s influence among the diasporas.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea began diplomatic outreach to neutral or non-aligned countries in the late 1950s. In doing so, it treated international criticism of religious repression as an imperialist attack and an interference in domestic affairs. North Korea strategically ignored or downplayed religious freedom issues on the global stage while reinforcing domestic repression. The support of fellow socialist states enabled North Korea to justify its severe treatment of Christians as a necessary measure to protect its regime from ideological threats.\n\nIn sum, religious persecution in North Korea during the 1950s was not just a matter of internal policy but a calculated response to its international environment. Its relationships with the Soviet Union and China encouraged anti-religious campaigns, while antagonism toward the U.S. fueled its portrayal of Christianity as an enemy ideology. Even interactions with Japan and neutral states played a role in shaping how the North Korean regime isolated and suppressed Christianity. The repression of religion during this decade was deeply interwoven with North Korea’s broader foreign policy and survival strategy.\n\n\nTable 2.
