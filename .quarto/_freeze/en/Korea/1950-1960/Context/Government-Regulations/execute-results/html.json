Among these, religion emerged as both a cultural force and a mechanism of governance. Under President Syngman Rhee, whose political vision was deeply rooted in Protestant Christianity, the religious policy of the First Republic reveals a dual structure: the promotion of Christianity as a core national identity and the state's strategic involvement in managing other religious communities. This paper provides an objective analysis of the First Republic's religious policies, particularly focusing on the institutional promotion of Christianity and the state's role in shaping the religious landscape of post-liberation Korea.\n\nThe 1948 Constitution of the Republic of Korea enshrined the principle of religious freedom and the separation of religion and state (Article 20). However, in practice, the Rhee administration implemented a range of policies that strongly favored Christianity, particularly Protestantism, while engaging selectively with other religious traditions. This gap between constitutional ideals and practical governance reveals the complex interplay of ideology, religion, and statecraft in early Korean democracy.\n\nPresident Rhee, educated and baptized in the United States, viewed Christianity as not only a personal faith but also a civilizational foundation for national development. In his 1945 speech at Jeongdong First Methodist Church, he stated his intention to \"build the nation on the Bible.\" This vision materialized in symbolic and institutional forms: Christian rituals were adopted in the 1948 National Assembly opening and presidential inauguration, and Protestant leaders like Rev. Lee Yoon-young played ceremonial roles in state functions.\n\nInstitutionally, Christianity was embedded into various sectors:\n\nThe military chaplain system and prison ministry (hyeongmok system) were implemented, primarily under Protestant and Catholic leadership.\n\nChristian media institutions such as CBS (1954) and Far East Broadcasting Company (1956) were established with state approval.\n\nNumerous high-level government officials were practicing Christians, creating a visible religious preference in governance.\n\nChristian lawmakers were significantly represented in the Constituent Assembly (estimated 21–24% of members), disproportionately high compared to the national Christian population at the time (0.5–2%).\n\n\nChristianity became aligned with the state’s ideological opposition to communism, especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The persecution of Christians in North Korea, including the martyrdom of figures such as Rev. Son Yang-won, was highlighted to construct Christianity as a bulwark of anti-communism and moral resistance. Churches and Christian institutions supported state campaigns in education, military morale, and national reconstruction.\n\nChristian groups also supported land reform policies. Rhee's 1949–50 land reform, which dismantled the landlord-tenant structure of colonial Korea and transitioned tenant farmers into landowners, was positively evaluated from a Christian worldview emphasizing economic justice and love-based governance. The land reform reduced inequality and contributed to the foundation of economic modernization.\n\n\nWhile Christianity received state endorsement, other religions experienced selective engagement, state-led reform, and in some cases, coercive control. In 1954, amid conflict between celibate (bigu) monks and married clergy (daecheo seung), the Rhee administration issued the \"Purification Edict,\" recognizing the former as legitimate. While the edict facilitated institutional reform and monastic consolidation, it also constituted an unconstitutional state intervention, as condemned by the National Assembly.The state's involvement set a precedent for political entanglement in Buddhist affairs that reverberated into the late 20th century.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1964, the Confucian community was divided between the 'Nong-eun' and 'Orthodox' factions. Although a Christian, Rhee was endorsed as president of the Confucian Yudohoe by the Nong-eun group. His acceptance contributed to the marginalization of traditional leaders like Kim Chang-sook and raised concerns about religious neutrality in governance.\n\nEmergent religious movements were often labeled as \"pseudo-religions\" or \"heresies\" and subjected to police surveillance or outright suppression. In several cases, leaders of new religious groups were arrested, and their organizations forcibly disbanded, in contravention of constitutional protections.\n\nA notable area of church-state conflict was the dispute over mandatory flag salutes (kukgi baerye), particularly in Presbyterian circles. Rooted in a historical resistance to Shinto shrine worship under Japanese rule, some Christians interpreted the bowing to the national flag as a form of idolatry. Prominent Christian leaders, such as Rev. Sohn Yang-won and Pastor Lee Won-young, publicly opposed the practice, leading to legal and social confrontations between churches and schools enforcing patriotic rituals.\n\nThe First Republic's religious policies enabled the rapid institutional growth of Christianity and its integration into state ideology. Simultaneously, these policies disrupted the autonomy of other religious traditions and weakened their internal governance. While Christianity benefited from state support, it also became entangled with political power, leading to long-term challenges in maintaining religious neutrality and public trust.\n\nThe religious policy of the First Republic was a complex system shaped by the theological convictions of its leadership, the exigencies of Cold War politics, and the sociopolitical restructuring of post-colonial Korea. Christianity was not merely favored but structurally embedded in the state's vision of modernization and anti-communism. Conversely, the state's interventions in Buddhism, Confucianism, and new religions illustrate how religious diversity was managed through selective support and strategic control. These dynamics have left a lasting imprint on the relationship between religion and state in South Korea.\n\n\nTable 1.

Christian leaders like Cho Man-sik were viewed as advocates of democratic order. In October 1945, Kim Il Sung reportedly instructed Kang Ryang-uk, “Bring progressive and influential pastors and elders into the fold, so that Christians will gain correct awareness of our righteous cause for building a new democratic Korea.” As a result, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) was founded in Pyongyang on November 28, 1946, with Kang Ryang-uk as chairman. The KCF's platform declared its goal to “awaken patriotism based on Christian principles of love and to participate in the national construction project.” However, internally, the KCF was a tool for weakening and absorbing the independent church. According to Kim Yang-sun, a pastor who defected to the South, the KCF's real purpose was to “foment internal division and drive the church to self-destruction.”\n\n\nRegime Establishment and War Period (1948–1953): Systematic Persecution and Emergence of the Underground Church\n\nAfter the establishment of the DPRK in 1948, Christianity was redefined as a “remnant of imperialist ideology” and associated with American espionage. During the Korean War, Christians were accused of collaborating with UN forces, leading to mass arrests, executions, and forced disappearances. Pastor Yoo Sahyun, who defected to the South in 1952, recalled that “five or six believers gathered in secret, shedding tears in prayer,” indicating the shift of religious life into secrecy. Following the war, the equation “Christian = spy” became entrenched, and even home-based religious activity was criminalized and surveilled. Incidents such as the hymnal case in Pakcheon County (1959) and the cross incident at Wonsan Railway Factory (1960) show that some believers still tried to worship in secret.\n\n\nPostwar Era (1953–1960): Atheism Campaigns and Dismantling of Public Religion\n\nAfter the war, the North Korean regime initiated a comprehensive atheism campaign. The book Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959) by Chong Ha-chol defined Christianity as “a belief in divine power that undermines socialist construction by replacing self-effort with the will of God.” The 1957 Iman-hwa case in Yongcheon County—where a pastor was prosecuted for refusing to vote—illustrates how Christian dissent was framed as anti-socialist behavior. As a result, “all official Christian activity in North Korea ceased between 1958 and 1972.” During this period, Christianity survived only as a clandestine faith practiced in underground networks, many of which were infiltrated or dissolved.\n\n\nTable 2.

Religious institutions, especially Protestant churches, supported the regime and became entwined with state-led anti-communist campaigns.\n\nIn the North, the state pursued the \"Democratic Base Theory”a strategy to export socialist revolution from the North to the South. Christianity was violently suppressed as a pro-American and counter-revolutionary force. Thousands of pastors and believers fled to the South or were imprisoned. The Korean Christian Federation (Josŏn Kidokkyo-do Yŏnmaeng) was established in 1946 to serve as a nominal religious body under state control.\n\n ",
