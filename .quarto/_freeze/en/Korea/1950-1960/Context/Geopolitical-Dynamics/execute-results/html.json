During this time, the country’s interactions with neighboring Asian-Pacific states, particularly North Korea, China, and Japan, and with Christian-majority nations such as the United States and Canada, were deeply influenced by religious, political, and ideological factors. Concurrently, expressions of nationalism and patriotism emerged in complex forms, often interwoven with Christian sentiment, public rituals, and anti-communist ideology.\n\nAfter liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, South Korea’s relationship with North Korea quickly devolved into ideological opposition that culminated in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The war marked a defining moment in the South’s assertion of identity, with Christianity positioned as a moral and spiritual force against atheistic communism. In the North, Christian churches were suppressed and believers persecuted; pastors were arrested, churches were closed, and many Christians fled to the South. Estimates suggest that two-thirds of the clergy in North Korea relocated southward, where they contributed to the growth of the Christian community. For missionaries and South Korean leaders alike, the war was not merely a military conflict but also a religious and civilizational struggle. The perceived clash between a Christian South and a communist North elevated the role of Christianity in state ideology and contributed to the consolidation of national unity under the banner of anti-communism. \n\nSouth Korea’s postwar stance toward Japan was largely shaped by historical resentment stemming from its colonial past. While diplomatic ties remained limited during this period, Christian institutions benefited from this estrangement. American and Canadian missionaries, in particular, were viewed as symbols of non-colonial benevolence in contrast to Japanese imperial oppression. This perception bolstered the legitimacy and influence of Christian missions in Korea, especially in rural and war-torn regions. During the war, Japan also functioned as a logistical and temporary humanitarian base for missionaries who were evacuated from the peninsula. Canadian and American missionaries stationed in Seoul and other cities fled to Japan in the early days of the conflict, only to return later to continue relief and evangelistic work.\n\nChina’s involvement in the Korean War further complicated South Korea’s regional relationships. Before the Chinese entry into the war in late 1950, some missionaries held out hope that Christian work might continue on the mainland. However, China’s intervention dashed such expectations, positioning the Chinese Communist regime as a clear adversary of South Korean Christianity. American and Canadian missionaries interpreted China’s actions not just as military aggression but as part of a broader communist threat to the Christian presence in Asia. As China became more closely aligned with North Korea, the ideological and theological divide in East Asia became more pronounced.\n\nSouth Korea’s relationship with the United States during this period was marked by deep military, political, and religious cooperation. American Protestant missionaries had laid the groundwork for Christianity in Korea since the late 19th century, establishing schools, hospitals, and churches that became pivotal institutions in Korean society. During the Korean War, this relationship deepened. The United States, through the United Nations Command, became South Korea’s primary military protector. Simultaneously, American churches, missionaries, and Christian organizations mobilized spiritual and material support for Korea, presenting the conflict as a defense of Christian civilization. The World Council of Churches formally condemned North Korea’s aggression and endorsed the UN military action, reinforcing the belief that the war was a moral as well as political battle. American missionaries often served as chaplains to Korean troops and civilians, helping to interpret the war through a Christian lens and providing essential humanitarian aid in the midst of destruction.\n\nCanada also maintained significant missionary and theological ties with Korea. Canadian missionaries had been active in northern Korea since the early 20th century, especially in Hamheung and the surrounding provinces. Following the division of Korea and the rise of communism in the North, Canadian missionaries hoped to return to their former mission fields, but the war and political changes made that impossible. Nevertheless, Canadian missionaries continued to support Korean Christians through their work in Seoul and southern regions, often ministering to northern refugees. Figures such as Florence Murray played leading roles in wartime medical and relief work, while others maintained educational and theological ministries despite repeated evacuations. These missionaries saw in Korea not only a spiritual calling but also a strategic battleground in the fight against communism, echoing broader Cold War sentiments prevalent in Western churches.\n\nExpressions of nationalism and patriotism during this era were deeply intertwined with Christian ideology. After liberation, the growth of Christian schools, hospitals, and churches was not only a matter of religious development but also a nationalistic endeavor. Mission schools like Ewha Girls’ School and Pai Chai Haktang became centers of civic awakening and national pride. Their curricula emphasized not just religious instruction but also liberal arts education, physical training, and public speaking, all intended to develop leaders for an independent Korean nation. Students participated in national ceremonies and were often involved in pro-independence movements. Christianity thus played a formative role in shaping a modern, educated, and politically conscious Korean identity.\n\nDuring the Korean War, nationalism was often expressed through religious symbols and rituals. Revival meetings, mass prayer gatherings, and public confessions of sin took on patriotic overtones. The church became both a refuge from war and a space for the cultivation of national spirit. Sermons often fused biblical narratives with themes of national suffering and redemption. Christian leaders emphasized that faith in Christ and loyalty to the nation were mutually reinforcing commitments. Public mourning for the war dead, prayers for national survival, and acts of charity were seen not only as Christian duties but as patriotic acts. In this context, the border between religious devotion and civic nationalism became increasingly blurred. The press and public discourse during this decade also reflected these sentiments. Newspapers and Christian publications described Korea as a “chosen nation” destined to resist communism and lead Asia in spiritual renewal. Anti-communist propaganda often relied on religious metaphors, and many church leaders were celebrated as national heroes. Christianity, especially Protestantism, was portrayed as a modernizing force capable of saving Korea from both its feudal past and the threat of totalitarianism. Even secular leaders like President Syngman Rhee, himself a devout Christian, invoked Christian rhetoric to frame national policy and foreign relations.\n\nIn summary, between 1945 and 1960, South Korea’s relationships with neighboring countries and Christian-majority nations were shaped not only by military and political factors but also by deep religious convictions. Christianity provided a framework through which Koreans interpreted war, occupation, independence, and national purpose. American and Canadian missionaries were more than religious figures; they were builders of civil society, allies in ideological warfare, and participants in Korea’s national drama. In return, Korean Christians embraced faith as both a spiritual refuge and a patriotic duty, contributing to the remarkable expansion of Christianity during a time of national trauma and transformation.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nIn the 1950s, Christianity in North Korea was not merely perceived as a religious practice but rather as a fundamental threat to the regime. This perception was deeply shaped by North Korea's diplomatic relations with neighboring countries and the broader international climate. Following liberation, North Korea, under the strong influence of the Soviet Union, quickly adopted a socialist system and embraced an atheistic ideology, which fundamentally rejected religion as antithetical to state ideology. Christianity, particularly, was seen as a symbol of Western civilization tied to the United States, which led North Korean authorities to brand it as an extension of imperialism and a tool of counterrevolution.\n\nThe relationship with the Soviet Union played a foundational role in shaping North Korea’s religious policies. As the North modeled its state apparatus on Stalinist socialism, religion was completely rejected and categorized as superstition. To ensure ideological conformity and social unity, churches were shut down and Christians were labeled as spies or reactionaries. Clergy and believers often ended up in labor camps or faced public execution. This ideological alignment with the Soviet model provided the justification for systemic religious persecution.\n\nNorth Korea's relations with China also significantly impacted its policy toward religion. During the Korean War, China's military intervention through the People's Volunteer Army was pivotal to North Korea's survival. This event led to closer strategic cooperation between the two nations. At the same time, China was suppressing Christianity as a remnant of bourgeois influence, especially during the lead-up to the Cultural Revolution. North Korea and China thus shared a common stance on religion and coordinated their efforts to eliminate Christianity, treating it as a hindrance to the construction of socialist ideology.\n\nHostility toward the United States further intensified the repression of Christianity. As North Korea's most prominent adversary, the U.S. was viewed not only as a military threat but also as a cultural and ideological one. Christianity, associated with American influence, was treated as a subversive force. Christians were accused of being collaborators with U.S. forces or South Korean intelligence, and religious activities were treated as acts of treason. Churches were closed, Bibles were burned, and many believers went underground. Persecution was not solely due to religious beliefs, but because Christianity was framed as a tool of American imperialism.\n\nIn relation to Japan, North Korea kept a close watch on Korean Christian communities among Zainichi Koreans. Many of these communities were centered around churches in Japan. However, the North saw Christian churches as a threat to ideological unity and attempted to control religious activity through pro-Pyongyang organizations like Chongryon. Religious organizations were sidelined in favor of ideological education through Korean schools, reflecting Pyongyang’s effort to neutralize Christianity’s influence among the diasporas.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea began diplomatic outreach to neutral or non-aligned countries in the late 1950s. In doing so, it treated international criticism of religious repression as an imperialist attack and an interference in domestic affairs. North Korea strategically ignored or downplayed religious freedom issues on the global stage while reinforcing domestic repression. The support of fellow socialist states enabled North Korea to justify its severe treatment of Christians as a necessary measure to protect its regime from ideological threats.\n\nIn sum, religious persecution in North Korea during the 1950s was not just a matter of internal policy but a calculated response to its international environment. Its relationships with the Soviet Union and China encouraged anti-religious campaigns, while antagonism toward the U.S. fueled its portrayal of Christianity as an enemy ideology. Even interactions with Japan and neutral states played a role in shaping how the North Korean regime isolated and suppressed Christianity. The repression of religion during this decade was deeply interwoven with North Korea’s broader foreign policy and survival strategy.\n\n\nTable 2.
