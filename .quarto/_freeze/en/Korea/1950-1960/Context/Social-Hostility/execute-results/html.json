Rather, it emerged out of a complex historical context shaped by liberation, national division, and war, during which Christianity became deeply entangled in politics, society, and culture. In this period, Christianity played a central role in postwar recovery and humanitarian efforts but was also criticized for its association with foreign powers, monopolization of authority, and internal factionalism.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Korean War, Christian churches—particularly those led by northern refugees affiliated with the Presbyterian Church—took the lead in relief and reconstruction efforts. Through close partnerships with American missionaries and church networks, they secured significant amounts of aid and humanitarian resources. This positioned them as key power brokers in both the church and society. However, this monopolization of aid and leadership led to conflict with other Christian groups, especially those from the Koryŏ-sin (Ko-Shin) and Chosŏn Theological Seminary (KiJang) traditions. These groups were marginalized, often accused of heresy, and pushed out of mainstream denominational structures. As a result, Christianity came to be seen by the public not as a moral or spiritual community but as an exclusive and power-driven institution. Another source of criticism was the church’s close association with foreign powers, particularly the United States. American churches and missionaries supported Korea’s Christians with money, personnel, and material aid, but this also reinforced the image of Christianity as foreign, Western, and anti-communist. This perception contributed to a growing belief that Christianity was aligned with U.S. imperial interests and the anti-communist agenda of the Syngman Rhee government. For nationalist intellectuals and youth disillusioned by American influence, Christianity appeared complicit in foreign domination. Moreover, the collaboration between Christian leaders and the authoritarian regime under Syngman Rhee added to this negative perception. Church figures often supported Rhee’s anti-communist rhetoric and were publicly praised by the government. This blurred the lines between political and religious authority, further reinforcing the belief that the church was entangled with state power.\n\nDespite these criticisms, it would be inaccurate to dismiss the role of Christianity in Korean society during this period as entirely negative. Many missionaries and Korean Christian leaders engaged in genuine humanitarian work: caring for refugees, providing medical services, operating orphanages and widow shelters, and rebuilding war-torn communities. American churches led national campaigns to raise funds and send aid to Korea. These efforts not only alleviated suffering but also helped lay the foundations for modern social welfare and education systems in South Korea. In the long run, Christianity contributed to the internalization of democratic values, civic ethics, and the development of civil society in the postwar era. Christianity, by virtue of its visibility and influence, inevitably drew both praise and criticism. Its rise to prominence amid national trauma and reconstruction created tensions across social groups, generating a complex mixture of trust and hostility. However, this hostility was not born of blind rejection. It was a reflection of Christianity’s historical positioning—as a moral force, political actor, and cultural mediator—in a society undergoing radical transformation. ",
