Kyung-Chik Han’s activities extended beyond mere evangelism or church growth. He stood at the center of a nationwide evangelization movement that was deeply entangled with the national agenda. Alongside Hwal-lan Kim, Han launched the National Evangelization Movement in 1965, shifting the focus from church-based outreach to a nationwide strategy grounded in interdenominational unity. In 1973, he played a leading role in organizing the Billy Graham Crusade and the Centennial Mission Conference, symbolizing a unifying force based on moderate evangelical ecumenism. Han introduced the concept of Evangelism in Depth, emphasizing that “evangelistic witness must be complete, profound, and continuous,” and that it must “be embodied in daily life, aiming for a universal and cosmic impact.” This approach extended the church's mission beyond traditional preaching to a more embedded and transformative presence in everyday life, targeting national evangelization as a long-term goal.\n\nHan’s evangelistic movement was not limited to personal conversion but was closely linked with a vision for constructing a Christian-based national ethos. From the post-liberation period onward, Han proclaimed that “the basic spirit of Christianity—human dignity, freedom, and equality—must serve as the foundation for the newborn Republic of Korea.” He once preached, “If we launch a gospel movement with Christian ideals to reform the ideology of the Korean people, I am confident that a righteous, independent Christian Korea will be swiftly realized.” These convictions resonated with President Syngman Rhee’s liberal democratic philosophy and contributed to shaping the foundational ideology of the Republic. Han once stated, “The Republic of Korea must be built upon the spirit of Christianity, and the church must function as the nation’s spiritual leadership institution.”\n\nIn alignment with Cold War anti-communist ideology, Han led the “Total Military Evangelization Movement,” aimed at converting soldiers to Christianity, and received official support from the government and military authorities. This represented a practical form of evangelical nationalism during an era of close church-state relations. However, his industrial mission faced setbacks as it conflicted with labor rights and social justice issues. In 1983, Youngnak Church ultimately withdrew support for the industrial mission, illustrating the difficulty of reconciling Han’s moderate evangelicalism with the more radical demands of labor activism.\n\nIn sum, Han’s ministry in the 1970s evolved from an individual-focused evangelicalism to a comprehensive vision encompassing church unity, nation-building, and structural social transformation. His efforts represent an unprecedented fusion of religious and social engagement in the history of modern Korean Christianity.\n\n\n장준하 張俊河 Chun-ha Chang\n\n08/27/1918 ~ 08/17/1975\n\n\nThe 1970s were not merely a period of resistance against the Yushin regime for Jang Jun-ha—they were the culmination of his intellectual struggle and the stage for his martyrdom. Through the monthly journal Sasangge (Thought World), which he founded in 1953, he declared, “Our people must end the history of slavish submission and recover our own tradition and freedom,” embracing journalism as a moral mission to realize the public good. Sasangge was not merely a publication—it was a living forum of public discourse through which Jang shared his political philosophy, nationalism, and democratic ideals with the public. When Sasangge was forcibly shut down by the Park Chung-hee regime, Jang saw it not just as an act of censorship, but as an assault on critical intellectual space and liberal-nationalist discourse. He stated that it was “time to change our method of struggle against the perpetrators of May 16 [the 1961 coup],” and shifted fully into the realm of active politics. The closure of Sasangge represented not merely the silencing of a journal but the violent suppression of a free and ethical public sphere.\n\nAs a Christian, Jang Jun-ha integrated his faith with his political ethics. While studying at a theological seminary in Tokyo, he was conscripted into the Japanese army as a student soldier. However, unable to endure the humiliation and racial discrimination, he defected and joined the Korean Liberation Army. His decision was rooted not only in nationalism but also in a spiritual conscience. “My life only has value from this moment onward,” he resolved, equating martyr-like faith with national awakening. To him, the idea that “a Christian cannot remain silent in the face of falsehood and oppression” was not a metaphor—it was a conviction. Throughout his writings and speeches, the themes of “conscience” and “justice” repeatedly appear, grounded in theological vision. He declared, “If the life of the nation is cut off, then my own life has no meaning. A self that exists apart from a suffering people is no longer truly a self.” In this way, he understood the realization of the self as a spiritual act of communal solidarity—one could not stand before God without standing with the people. Christian faith, for Jang, was the basis for a public calling. He believed “the press is the weapon of civil rights, and its mission is like that of salt and light,” seeing journalism not simply as reporting, but as prophetic testimony. His resistance to the Yushin regime in the 1970s was not merely political rationalism—it was a moral imperative, born of a Christian commitment to truth and righteousness. In this regard, he is remembered not only as a nationalist but as a prophetic intellectual rooted in the Christian theology of justice.\n\nEven in his final years, Jang maintained strong ties to Christian communities. After his death in 1975 under suspicious circumstances at Yaksa Peak in Pocheon, many in the Korean Protestant world mourned him as “a modern-day Amos.” His death was not viewed as a political incident alone, but as a form of martyrdom—an embodiment of Christian conscience and sacrificial spirit.\n\n\n김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim\n\n09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987\n\n\nKim Jae-jun emerged in the 1970s as a symbol of Christian resistance grounded in liberal theology amidst the oppressive Yushin regime in South Korea. From the anti-third-term amendment movement in 1969 to his role as a representative of the National Council for the Protection of Democracy in 1971 and his outspoken opposition to the 1972 Yushin Constitution, Kim persistently confronted dictatorship. His actions drew increasing scrutiny from the state, leading to prolonged house arrest and surveillance. In March 1974, at the age of 74, he departed for Toronto, Canada, under the pretense of a brief stay. However, this departure effectively became a decade-long political exile. As he later recalled, he initially intended to stay abroad “only for two to three months,” but circumstances forced him into a prolonged absence from his homeland.\n\nHis exile was not an escape but a strategic relocation that opened a new front in the democratization struggle through international solidarity. Shortly after his arrival in Canada, Kim joined the Washington-based Korean Congress for Democracy and Unification (Hanmin-tong), an overseas organization that championed Kim Dae-jung’s “Democracy First, Unification Later” policy. Kim offered theological and moral legitimacy to the organization’s mission. He argued, “Justice without freedom undermines the essence of humanity,” affirming that political liberty was an extension of his theological convictions. His involvement symbolized a powerful convergence between liberal Christianity and democratic political ideals and served to strengthen the international network supporting Korea’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nKim’s political vision shifted in the 1970s from Cold War anti-communism to a human-centered historical consciousness. As a North Korean refugee and staunch anti-communist, he initially resonated with conservative nationalist views. However, he came to believe that “the suffering of the Korean people cannot be confined within the dichotomy of regime confrontation.” This realization led him to reframe the unification issue not merely as a geopolitical struggle but as a question of human rights and social justice. In line with Kim Dae-jung’s three-stage unification proposal, Kim emphasized that democracy and human dignity must precede any political reunification.\n\nThough Kim did not explicitly label himself a proponent of Minjung theology, his theology of participation laid the groundwork for it. He was deeply critical of the escapist tendencies of Korean Christianity, famously stating, “The slogan ‘Believe in Jesus and go to heaven’ ultimately promotes indifference to social reality or even encourages retreat from it”. He emphasized that the church must act as “salt and leaven” in society and that theology must be lived through the pursuit of justice, freedom, and human dignity. “The church,” he wrote, “must declare God's will by engaging in political critique, participation, action, supporting the best possible political models, and raising consciousness among clergy, laity, and those outside the church alike”. From this theological foundation, Kim advanced the concept of “theology of humanization,” in which the preservation of human freedom and dignity supersedes all political systems. His liberalism was not merely an importation of Western democratic ideals but a contextual theological response to Korea’s divided and repressive realities. His declaration that “the state has no reason to exist unless it guarantees human freedom and welfare” reflects his unwavering resistance to totalitarian rule.\n\nKim Jae-jun’s activities in the 1970s were not merely anti-Yushin protests but a holistic engagement that wove together theology and politics, domestic and global alliances, resistance and participation. He simultaneously pursued church reform and societal democratization, anchoring his work in a theological commitment to human liberation, national reconciliation, and moral responsibility. His life exemplified how Christian theology could be a driving force in the fight for justice and democracy.\n\n\n문익환 文益煥 Ik-hwan Moon\n\n06/01/1918 ~ 01/18/1994\n\n\nMoon Ik-hwan's life was theology itself, and his theology was the language of participation and obedience to the suffering people of his time. He was remembered as “a man who stormed against unjust power like a hurricane, yet approached bare-handed workers and the socially marginalized with the gentleness of a lamb,” and someone who “carried a more delicate and humble sensibility than a sprig of baby’s breath in his heart” as a pastor and spiritual leader. These seemingly contradictory qualities were not disjointed but rather a dialectical fruit of his lived theology.\n\nHis theological praxis took public form when he became the chair of the joint translation committee for the Old and New Testaments of the Bible under the Korean Bible Society in 1968. He did not view this as an academic task but as a transformative spiritual experience, stating that it was like “witnessing the collapse of three Jericho walls: the wall between Protestants and Catholics, the wall of theological prejudice, and the wall between Hebrew and Korean ways of thinking.” He resigned from his professorship and pastoral post to devote himself fully to this mission, and in the process, began writing poetry. He once confessed, “I did not start writing poetry to be judged as a poet but to discover myself. I sensed that this poetic activity might mark a turning point in my theological thinking.” His poetry carried the rhythm of the Hebrew Psalms and gradually evolved into a prophetic language of consolation and awakening for the Korean people. As one article noted, Moon was \"the one who planted the language of the Bible into the Korean Peninsula,\" making the Word of God accessible through the Korean language.In his translation, for instance, the Hebrew term shalom was not merely rendered as “peace,” but as a comprehensive reality of justice, completeness, life, and communion.\n\nA turning point in his public engagement came in 1975 with the suspicious death of Jang Jun-ha, a fellow democracy activist. “At the very moment of his burial,” Moon later recalled, “I vowed to live out his life in his place.” This resolution led to the drafting and public reading of the March 1st Declaration for National Salvation in 1976. But this transition did not emerge from a vacuum; he had already been involved in workers’ advocacy after the 1970 self-immolation of laborer Jeon Tae-il. He frequently visited the Cheonggye union to support and console workers. Jeon’s mother, Lee So-seon, remembered Moon as “a father figure who protected us with his entire being.”\n\nMoon radically reimagined the church. In a sermon, he declared, “The church is not a place that drugs people with religion and quietly sends them off to the next world—it must be a place that brings people to life.” He added, “We don’t need dead Christians who only whimper their way into heaven; we need churches overflowing with creative believers whose eyes shine with moral power, like a living, breathing body.” At the core of his theology was a structural integration of love, justice, peace, and life. “Justice,” he wrote, “is love erupting in anger. It is the social expression of love. Biblical peace is not mere calm but the fullness of life. Perfection, as Christ commanded, is perfection in love.” Peace (shalom), therefore, was not merely an eschatological hope but a historical mandate grounded in solidarity and resistance.\n\nUnification for Moon was not a political option but a theological imperative. He recalled his father’s words: “My father used to mutter even on his deathbed, ‘For our nation to be unified, the church must be united first.’” For Moon, nationalism was never to be confused with state ideology but understood as a “people-centered nationalism.” He believed “the common people, unlike those with vested interests, are naturally peace-oriented because they have nothing to defend with war.” His final major work, A History of the Hebrew People, was a theological and poetic retelling of the Bible from the perspective of the oppressed, connecting the exodus of the Hebrews with the aspirations of the Korean people. It has been evaluated as “a theological testimony of the feet that walked the path of liberation,” and a cornerstone of Korean Minjung theology.\n\n\n장기려 張起呂Gi-ryeo Jang\n\n10/05/1911 ~ 12/25/1995\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dr. Chang Kee-Ryo stood at the intersection of medicine, faith, and social justice. As a surgeon, educator, and Christian, he pioneered liver disease treatment in Korea and laid the groundwork for equitable health coverage through the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative. His holistic approach to healthcare—anchored in Christian ethics and civic responsibility—defined a new model of medical professionalism in postwar Korea.\n\nDr. Chang was the first in Korea to perform successful liver resections for liver cancer, initially in 1943, and later a large-volume hepatectomy in 1959. These groundbreaking procedures were not only clinical milestones but also reflections of his deep-seated belief in the healing ministry of medicine. As one colleague testified, “Dr. Chang believed that the body is governed by natural laws and that disease was a deviation from physiological order… this belief enabled him to succeed in what was then considered an impossible liver surgery”. In 1974, he founded the Korean Liver Research Association and served as its first president, institutionalizing his commitment to advancing hepatic medicine. However, Dr. Chang's work extended beyond operating rooms and laboratories. His founding of the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative in 1968 was a pivotal moment in Korea’s social welfare history. This nonprofit health insurance model was built on egalitarian principles: monthly premiums were flat regardless of age or health status, and no one was excluded from enrollment. At a time when the national health insurance law (1963) was still nominal and unenforceable due to lack of government funding, Dr. Chang’s initiative filled a critical gap. The Cooperative was deeply rooted in Christian values. Weekly Bible studies, known as the “Busan Meeting,” provided the intellectual and spiritual foundation for the insurance scheme. Dr. Chang described Christian love as “a spirit of cooperation” and sought to embody this in the Cooperative’s operations. He viewed healing not only as a clinical act but as an expression of divine compassion, once writing, “I believe the essence of medical practice lies in identifying with the suffering of the patient as if I were the patient myself”.\n\nEven more striking was his personal lifestyle: he refused to own property, lived in a small hospital dormitory after retirement, and once quietly opened a back door to let a patient without money “escape” hospital billing. When the national health insurance program began in 1989, Dr. Chang voluntarily dissolved the Cooperative and handed over its resources to the state—a gesture that epitomized his commitment to public good over institutional survival. Dr. Chang's professionalism extended into his teaching. He inspired generations of students with an almost ascetic devotion to truth and precision. One of his most famous declarations was: “A physician who does not leave behind written reflections on both success and failure is no more than a parasite among his peers”. Despite physical decline after a stroke, he continued correcting errors in his publications from his hospital bed.\n\nTo understand his legacy fully, one must see that Dr. Chang practiced medicine not as a commercial contract but as a sacred calling. He once declared, “From the day I became a doctor, I have never forgotten my promise to care for patients who cannot afford treatment. This is the yardstick by which I measure whether my life has been a success or a failure”.\n\n\n서남동 徐南同 Nam-dong Seo\n\n07/05/118 ~ 07/19/1984\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Reverend Seo Nam-dong emerged as a leading intellectual and practitioner who reshaped the landscape of Korean Christian theology. At the center of the Korean Association of Christian Professors (KACP), Seo played a pivotal role in articulating the theological foundations of ecumenical development theology and was instrumental in laying the groundwork for minjung theology—a theology rooted in the lived experiences and struggles of the oppressed.\n\nIn 1971, during the 9th KACP Annual Conference, Seo presented a seminal paper titled “The Humanization of Modern Science and Technology,” where he critically examined how technological advancement contributed to the alienation of human beings. He proposed that the path to humanization in the era of scientific and technological development lay in achieving balance and resonance between “technology and humanity, ideas and material, intuition and labor”. This reflects Seo’s effort to forge a theological response not just to spiritual questions but to the socio-material conditions of modern industrial life.\n\nThe Korean Association of Christian Professors, inspired by the World Council of Churches (WCC), developed the concept of the “Theology of Humanization” in line with global ecumenical missions. It sought to counteract the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and urbanization by restoring human dignity and agency. As a central leader and organizer of KACP, Seo contributed significantly to framing modernization not as a purely material project, but as a process rooted in human desire for liberation from poverty and oppression. He stated that modernization stemmed from “a fundamental longing for the liberation of human autonomy and creativity”.\n\nSeo's influence extended internationally. In 1973, although initially denied a travel visa, he was listed as a participant in several ecumenical conferences abroad and later preached the closing sermon at the joint Korea-Japan Christian Professors' Conference. His role in KACP was not only theological but also deeply political. In 1975, under Emergency Measure No. 9, he was forced into early retirement from Yonsei University. This act of political repression exemplified the state's crackdown on Christian intellectuals, including KACP's presidents, general secretaries, and leading thinkers.\n\nSeo Nam-dong’s theology was especially attentive to the concept of han—the deep sorrow and resentment of the oppressed in Korean cultural consciousness. He argued that theology must begin by responding to the wailing of the minjung (the people) and the groans of women. For Seo, the voices of the suffering were not just subjects of compassion but the very manifestation of God’s presence. As one article put it, “He heard the voice of God in their tears”. Hence, his radical declaration that “the minjung is Christ” underscored a profound theological shift: God is present not in the powers of the church or state, but in the depths of the people’s pain and struggle. Rather than confining his work to church reform, Seo advanced a liberative theology that confronted the structural violence of the South Korean state. He became known as a priest of han, embodying the pain and resistance of the oppressed. His theology was not abstract theorizing but a lived response to the urgent question, “Whose voice does theology listen to?” As one scholar observed, “Seo Nam-dong’s entire life was theology itself, and his theology was a cry for life and liberation”.\n\nIn conclusion, Seo Nam-dong was not only a theologian but also a prophetic public intellectual whose work shaped the Korean democratization movement and ecumenical theology of the 1970s. His thought continues to resonate today, urging theologians and Christians alike to engage with the cries of the marginalized and the demands of justice.\n\n\n지학순  池學淳  Daniel Ji Hak-soon\n\n09/09/1921 ~ 03/12/1993\n\n\nBishop Ji Hak-sun’s defiance of authoritarian rule in 1970s South Korea was not only an act of political courage but a theological embodiment of the Church’s mission to stand with the oppressed. His resistance emerged from the crossroads of global Catholic reform and Korea’s escalating dictatorship, culminating in a life that blurred the boundary between priesthood and prophetic activism.\n\nHaving studied canon law in Rome and ordained as bishop of the newly established Diocese of Wonju in 1965, Ji returned to Korea deeply influenced by the Second Vatican Council, which called the Church to recognize the “joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties” of all people, especially the poor and afflicted, as its own concerns. He later declared, “Priests must concretely practice the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social teachings of Popes John XXIII and Paul VI”. For Ji, these were not abstract exhortations but marching orders.\n\nHis pastoral leadership quickly collided with the growing repression of the Park Chung-hee regime. South Korea’s rapid industrialization, managed through crony capitalism and military control, led to deepening inequality, rural impoverishment, and urban labor exploitation. The people under Ji’s pastoral care—including coal miners, poor farmers, and factory workers—were among the most vulnerable. In this context, Ji came to see his role not merely as shepherd of souls, but as a defender of their dignity and survival. The moment of radical transformation came in 1970, when Ji confronted corruption in the establishment of Wonju MBC, a regional broadcasting station. Despite holding a minority share, his diocese faced stonewalling and disregard from the majority owner, the 5.16 Scholarship Foundation—a regime-aligned entity. Ji later reflected: “If a bishop is treated like this, what hope is there for ordinary people?”. This realization marked his shift from moral concern to civic resistance. Ji responded by organizing street marches and public protests to denounce institutionalized corruption, launching the Church into open confrontation with the state. This marked the first time a sitting bishop had taken such direct action against state authority in modern Korean history. The Park regime labeled his actions subversive, linking him to communist sympathizers merely because he advocated for human rights and defended figures like Kim Ji-ha, a poet and activist affiliated with Ji’s diocese.\n\nThe confrontation reached its apex in March 1974, when Ji signed the “3.1 Declaration for National Salvation,” a multi-faith statement condemning the Yushin Constitution and demanding democratic reforms. His participation was unprecedented: “I could no longer remain silent,” Ji explained later, describing his act as a “conscience declaration” in line with his priestly calling. This led to his arrest by the Korean CIA, imprisonment, and military trial. The Vatican expressed concern, and even U.S. diplomatic records show that his detention alarmed foreign observers, with one official warning that “a trial of a high-ranking clergyman would backfire internationally”. Yet Ji’s imprisonment ignited a powerful movement. His arrest became the catalyst for the formation of the Catholic Priests' Association for Justice, signaling a historic shift in the Korean Catholic Church’s posture—from cautious neutrality to prophetic engagement. As one scholar noted, “Ji’s suffering awakened the conscience of the Korean Church, showing that faith without justice was empty”.\n\nTheologically, Ji’s activism was grounded in what he called a “Christ-centered principle.” He viewed his ministry as a continuation of Christ’s suffering love for the world. “Like Christ carrying the cross, I too am resolved to suffer,” he wrote in his episcopal motto. His social engagement, including support for cooperatives, flood victims, and political prisoners, was an extension of this conviction that the Church must serve as “a sacrament of Christ in the world”.\n\nBishop Ji’s legacy in the 1970s lies not only in his personal resistance but in his transformation of the Korean Catholic Church into a voice of conscience in public life. By refusing to separate faith from justice, he redefined what it meant to be a bishop—not an administrator of rituals, but a witness to truth in the face of tyranny.\n\n\n김지하 金芝河 Ji-ha Kim\n\n02/04/1941 ~ 05/08/2022\n\n\nKim Ji-ha was not merely a poet in the 1970s, but a prophetic voice who confronted dictatorship with literature, faith, and philosophy. His works traversed the realms of literature, religion, and politics, giving expression to the suffering and resistance of the Korean people while shaping new theological and ecological discourse.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Kim Ji-ha made a powerful intervention into public discourse through his satirical poem Ojeok (The Five Bandits), a direct attack on the corruption of the Park Chung-hee regime. “After being imprisoned for his opposition to the 1964 Korea-Japan Treaty, Kim began articulating the suffering of the people through poetry”. His works were politically charged enough to provoke state suppression. For instance, his 1972 poem Bieo (Rumors), published in the Catholic monthly Creation, was immediately censored by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. The magazine was forced to shut down, and its editor and publisher had to resign.\n\nYet Kim's thought evolved through prison confinement, culminating in a spiritual awakening that redefined his philosophical trajectory. While incarcerated, he encountered The Phenomenon of Man by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a reading that proved transformative. He later recalled, “From that day, I realized I was no longer merely a believer of Cheondoism, but was returning to the original Donghak (Eastern Learning) of my ancestors”. This realization, which he called “a lopsided balance,” became the foundation for his new cosmic vision of life, which sought to integrate Eastern spirituality and Western evolutionary theology.\n\nKim did not see his newfound life philosophy as a retreat from politics. Rather, he framed it as a radical reinterpretation of the people’s struggle. He argued that “‘life,’ ‘ecology,’ and ‘the people’ are not separate concepts but interchangeable terms within the same discursive lineage”. In his poem Museun (What), he writes, “Thinking and thinking, and blocked in thought, I suddenly realized my life isn’t simple,” describing the universe not as distant but alive and teeming within him. Through this “biospiritual” poetics, he pushed beyond anthropocentrism and embraced a universal communion of beings. This transition influenced not only literature but also Korean theology. Kim Ji-ha’s poetry provided vital inspiration to theologian Suh Nam-dong, a founding figure of Korean minjung theology. “Suh Nam-dong even referred to Kim as a minjung theologian,” recognizing the deep theological significance of his literary imagination. Suh, who introduced Teilhard’s theology and the concept of Christian biopolitics to Korea, found in Kim’s life-centered poetry a theological language for liberation.\n\nMeanwhile, Kim was also deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching. Under the guidance of Chang Il-soon and Bishop Ji Hak-soon in the Diocese of Wonju, he studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and several papal encyclicals. “Kim Ji-ha recalled studying encyclicals and council documents while staying at Chang Il-soon’s home in 1970–71”. His play The Crowned Jesus embodies this synthesis: in a key scene, a nun rebukes a priest’s political apathy by invoking Catholic teachings—“Mother and Teacher, Peace on Earth, all the decisions of the Council, the words of the Pope, and the bishops’ calls for social justice”—in what is essentially Kim’s own voice speaking through her⁷. What makes The Crowned Jesus especially striking is that Kim’s critique did not merely rely on doctrine but reimagined the mutual agency of Jesus and the oppressed. In one scene, Jesus tells a leper: “You must liberate me. Only you can. Your poverty, wisdom, and courage against injustice are what free me. You have opened my mouth”. This reciprocal soteriology, in which the oppressed also save the Savior, reflects Kim’s theological innovation grounded in the Korean context.\n\nKim Ji-ha’s 1970s journey was thus not only literary and political but also theological and cosmological. His fusion of Catholic teaching, Donghak, Teilhardian evolution, and minjung consciousness rendered him not just a protest poet but a radical thinker seeking new foundations for humanity, justice, and creation itself.\n\n\n이우정 李愚貞 Woo-jung Lee\n\n08/01/1923 ~ 05/30/2002\n\n\nLee Woo-jung (1923–2002) was a leading Christian women’s rights activist in 1970s Korea, who bridged faith and action to address gender inequality, dictatorship, and systemic injustice. Her life and work exemplified a deeply theological commitment to human dignity, rooted in personal experience, Christian ethics, and resistance to the patriarchal and authoritarian structures of her time.\n\nBorn in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Lee was raised in a household shaped by contrasting influences: her grandfather Lee Hae-jo was a progressive educator who emphasized modern learning, while her father adhered strictly to Confucian values. Her early experiences of gender discrimination—such as being denied educational opportunities afforded to her brother—awakened her sensitivity to injustice. As a high school student, she even attempted to run away from home to avoid being conscripted into the Japanese military sexual slavery system. Eventually, her encounter with Christianity at a “Religion Church” in Seoul and her studies at Chosun Theological Seminary brought her into the orbit of influential figures like Kim Jae-jun and Moon Ik-hwan. Kim, in particular, emphasized the theological view that “in God there is no male or female,” affirming Lee’s dignity and instilling confidence in her.\n\nIn the 1970s, Lee emerged as a key figure in the Christian women’s movement. As president of the newly established Korean Church Women United (KCWU), she led efforts to confront state-condoned sex tourism targeting Japanese male visitors to Korea. Outraged by the exploitation of Korean women for foreign exchange, she declared: “We grieve over the reality that our daughters are being defiled under the excuse of earning foreign currency. We must protect our daughters”. She famously challenged the government by stating, “If prostitutes are the vanguard of earning foreign currency, then offer up your own daughters first”. Her leadership was instrumental in organizing education programs for women, lobbying government officials, and forming solidarity networks with Japanese and international women’s groups.\n\nLee’s feminism was grounded in a Christian anthropology of human dignity. She believed that women’s liberation was not simply about equal rights but about recovering their full humanity. “Women are oppressed in the family and workplace from a perspective that fundamentally denies their equal personhood,” she wrote, identifying sexism as a deeply embedded cultural structure. This philosophy undergirded her involvement in the 1976 March 1st Declaration for National Salvation, where she joined religious and political leaders in publicly denouncing President Park Chung-hee’s authoritarian regime. During her trial, she stated, “I participated out of a desire to defend freedom of religion and to call attention to injustice,” and declared, “I hope our society becomes one where people are treated as human beings”.\n\nHer political awakening was deepened by the death of labor activist Jeon Tae-il in 1970, which she described as “a moment that burdened my heart with a sense of debt to the workers, especially women workers”. Rather than turning away, she moved toward the suffering, engaging in labor rights advocacy, urban poor movements, and anti-torture campaigns throughout the decade. Lee later became a pioneer in Korean feminist theology. She advocated for a re-reading of Scripture through women’s eyes and criticized male-dominated theological frameworks. “True minjung theology must include the issue of women,” she emphasized, calling for a theology where women could participate freely in God’s salvific work. Her theological work was not merely academic but connected to grassroots activism, including support for unjustly fired female workers and campaigns for the rights of comfort women, factory workers, and displaced residents.\n\nLee Woo-jung’s legacy is a testament to a faith that walks alongside the oppressed and insists on their full humanity. She refused to separate theological reflection from lived reality, declaring through word and deed that “a single human being is more precious than the entire universe.”\n\n\n계의돈 Robert L. Goette\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dr. Robert L. Goette (Korean name: Gye Eui-don) emerged as a pivotal figure in evangelical higher education missions in Korea. As a lay educational missionary sent by the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), he realized an integrated model of mission that combined scientific education and gospel proclamation, primarily through his work at Hannam University. The 1970s marked a turning point in his ministry, as he transformed from a chemistry professor into a born-again evangelist committed to campus evangelization.\n\nHis spiritual renewal took place during a sabbatical in the United States in 1970, when he attended a Leadership Training Course (LTC) led by Dr. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC). There, he heard the verse, “For by grace you have been saved through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8–9). He confessed that this led him to repent of his misguided belief that salvation could be earned through good deeds, and he received assurance of salvation. From that point forward, he declared, “Teaching chemistry alone cannot transform people—only the Word of God can truly change lives.”\n\nUpon returning to Korea in 1971, his ministry focus shifted entirely. Goette regarded everyone—students, faculty, and alumni—as targets of evangelism, and prioritized personal evangelism and discipleship over programs or events. “His ministry focused not on events or programs, but on the salvation of individual souls,” noted a colleague. Inspired by 2 Timothy 2:2, he practiced spiritual multiplication by training faithful students who would, in turn, share the gospel with others.\n\nOne of his most distinctive contributions in the 1970s was institutionalizing creation science education. Beginning in 1976, he pioneered Korea’s first accredited university course on the topic, titled Bible and Science. At a time when Korean society was heavily influenced by scientific materialism and evolution, he taught that “many Koreans rejected the Bible because they had been falsely taught that evolution was factual and the Bible was wrong.” During a sabbatical, he collected educational materials—including films, books, and audio tapes—from the U.S. and translated them into Korean. He also wrote the Korean preface for the translated edition of Scientific Creationism by Henry Morris. Goette’s creation science class became foundational to the development of Christian worldview studies at Hannam University and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) in 1981. His course eventually enrolled close to 10,000 students and was adopted by other universities throughout Korea.\n\nHis evangelism extended beyond the classroom. In 1973, he opened a Christian Book Service Center on campus, providing free or low-cost access to Bibles and Christian literature in both English and Korean. He also practiced an ecumenical, holistic model of mission that integrated gospel witness with social responsibility. For example, he paid for surgery for a disabled female student and supported a hit-and-run victim’s recovery by giving him work as a groundskeeper and paying him a dignified salary.\n\nDr. Goette’s 1970s ministry exemplified a holistic, Christ-centered witness that combined intellectual rigor with personal piety and compassionate service. His legacy extends far beyond Hannam University’s chemistry department; it represents a model of evangelical mission that transformed lives, institutions, and ultimately, the trajectory of Christian higher education in Korea.\n\n\n김수환 추기경 金壽煥 Stephen Kim Sou-hwan\n\n07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009\n\n\nCardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan was a pivotal figure in redefining the Catholic Church’s role in Korean society during the turbulent 1970s. Drawing on the reformist spirit of the Second Vatican Council, he led the Korean Catholic Church toward becoming a “Church in the world,” grounded in justice and human dignity. Even under the authoritarian regime of President Park Chung Hee, he never relinquished the Church’s commitment to truth and compassion. When Bishop Ji Hak-sun was arrested in connection with the Mincheonghakryeon (National Democratic Youth and Student Federation) case in 1974, Cardinal Kim took the extraordinary step of directly meeting President Park to request Ji’s release. As one scholar notes, “Cardinal Kim made it clear that the Church could no longer remain silent,” and the incident marked a critical turning point in the Church’s engagement with social and political issues.\n\nCardinal Kim’s social involvement stemmed not from political ambition but from theological conviction. He declared, “Now the Church must give everything to serve society and become a Church in the world,” making it clear that faith must engage the public sphere. Under his leadership, Myeongdong Cathedral became not only a space of worship but also a symbol of democracy. He welcomed interreligious dialogue, inviting leaders of Buddhism, Protestantism, and other traditions to build peace and unity. Responding to a rapidly changing society, he emphasized, “Society demands that we bear witness to the Christ you profess by the way you live.” Cardinal Kim’s leadership stood out most clearly in his cautious but firm stance toward the Park regime. He did not openly attack the Yushin Constitution, yet he questioned the legitimacy of a system that trampled on human rights and dignity. When Bishop Ji was re-arrested after his \"Declaration of Conscience,\" Cardinal Kim avoided inflammatory rhetoric but articulated the Church’s position through quiet yet clear statements. His prudence allowed him to serve as a mediator between the radical priests of the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice and the institutional Church, preventing fragmentation while maintaining the Church’s moral credibility.\n\nAt a time when Korea was racing toward industrial development, Cardinal Kim raised urgent concerns about the cost of progress. As early as the 1970s, he stated, “Today’s society is clearly unhealthy. It is filled with spiritual and material pollution,” warning that Korea’s drive for modernization was eroding human dignity. “In the midst of material growth, humanity is deteriorating,” he argued, pointing to a system where spiritual poverty prevailed despite economic expansion. His critique was not merely economic or political—it was deeply ecological and theological. He saw the suffering of farmers, workers, and the urban poor as a sign of a deeper crisis: the loss of humanity and harmony with creation.\n\nCardinal Kim skillfully avoided politicizing religion while consistently affirming the Church’s moral responsibility. He believed that “religion should not be a place of escape from the world, but a source of hope for the world,” and his actions proved this belief. He upheld the view that the Church must stand with the people, not with power. While he rarely clashed directly with the Park regime, he used the moral authority of the Church to push for justice and human rights. His leadership not only reformed the Church in the 1970s but laid the ethical groundwork for Korea’s democratization in the following decades.\n\n\n조용기 趙鏞基David Yonggi Cho \n\n02/14/1936 ~ 09/14/2021\n\n\nPastor David Yonggi Cho’s activities during the 1970s marked a pivotal transformation in both the theology and social practice of the Korean church. During this time, as Yoido Full Gospel Church entered a period of rapid expansion, he systematized Pentecostal pneumatology while placing the care for marginalized populations at the heart of his ministry. On September 23, 1973, Yoido Full Gospel Church dedicated a 10,000-seat main sanctuary and hosted the 10th World Pentecostal Conference in Seoul, rising to global prominence within the Pentecostal movement. At this event, Cho declared, “Through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit... the church shall march on unhindered”.\n\nPastor Cho’s ministry directly confronted the social realities of South Korea’s rapid industrialization and urbanization, which produced significant social instability. Amid political repression and economic disparity, he envisioned the church as a “healing community offering hope to the poor.” His theological framework—expressed through the “Fivefold Gospel” and “Threefold Blessing”—went beyond doctrinal systems to function as a “spiritual and practical faith that simultaneously offers assurance of salvation and life transformation”. Reflecting on the desperation he witnessed, Cho recalled, “They were people in despair. The solution was to give them hope. I preached messages of hope from Genesis to Revelation based on 3 John 1:2. As a result, people were transformed, and those in despair began to smile again”.\n\nThis practical theology was implemented through a structured ministry strategy. In the 1970s, Cho introduced the cell group system, which enabled small community units within the church to provide prayer, counseling, and service—not only to church members but also to those in surrounding communities. Each cell group identified those in need, reported cases to the upper pastoral leadership, and ensured sustained support. Cho emphasized that “care must not be a one-time act, but continued until full restoration is achieved”.\n\nBeyond spiritual care and church growth, Cho stood at the center of Korea’s most contentious theological debates. His Pentecostal theology—which emphasized spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues, healing, and prophecy—was met with strong opposition from Reformed theologians, especially within Presbyterian circles. Park Hyung-ryong, in particular, published criticisms in the Shinhak Jinan journal, asserting that “regeneration and Spirit baptism are one and the same and occur only once.” In response, Cho defended his view through articles in Shinang-gye, stating, “Tongues are a powerful outward sign of Spirit-filled experience,” though he also sought to defuse tensions by clarifying, “I do not say that tongues are Spirit baptism itself”.\n\nTo further clarify and legitimize his theology, Cho published The Holy Spirit in 1971, a work widely regarded as “a compelling guidebook with an expansive interdenominational readership.” This book explained gifts of the Spirit such as tongues, healing, and power in systematic terms and argued that Pentecostal faith did not contradict evangelical orthodoxy. He also cited the 1970 decision of the United Presbyterian Church in the USA to affirm the biblical validity of glossolalia, using this to demonstrate that “Pentecostal pneumatology can be theologically embraced within the evangelical tradition”. Additionally, Cho sought out dialogue with progressive theologians and religious scholars to widen academic understanding of religious experience beyond confessional boundaries.\n\nThus, Pastor Cho’s 1970s ministry was not merely about institutional expansion but redefined the role of the Korean church in both spiritual and social dimensions. He offered a vision of Pentecostal revival that validated spiritual experience while compelling the church to respond to the cries of society’s most vulnerable. His church became a refuge for the urban poor, women, and the disenfranchised, and his theology empowered a new religious imagination that continues to shape global Pentecostalism.\n\n\n 김준곤 金俊坤  Jun Gon Kim\n\n03/2/1925 ~ 09/29/2000\n\n\nRev. Joon Gon Kim's ministry in the 1970s was one of the most comprehensive religious campaigns in modern Korean Christianity, intertwining evangelism, national renewal, and social transformation. Rather than limiting his efforts to preaching the gospel, Kim envisioned a full-scale evangelization of the Korean people—spiritual, cultural, and political—through a theological lens shaped by personal suffering and reformist convictions. His national evangelization movement emerged as a strategic response to the historical and political challenges of postwar Korea, including its authoritarian modernization under President Park Chung-hee.\n\nRev. Kim publicly launched the National Evangelization Movement on December 31, 1970, during a special year-end broadcast on CBS. He had already proposed the idea to President Park Chung-hee, and by February 1970, the movement had begun with state-level approval. As noted, “Rev. Joon Gon Kim initiated the National Believer Movement in February 1970, following his proposal to President Park in 1969.” This marked the beginning of a collaboration—albeit uneasy at times—between evangelical leaders and state power during Korea’s Yushin period.\n\nThe partnership between Kim and the Park regime was a calculated attempt to expand the reach of the gospel across Korean society. He did not shy away from working with political authorities to amplify the evangelical message. The mass revival rally EXPLO '74, which drew hundreds of thousands to Yeouido, Seoul, demonstrated Kim’s willingness to utilize state infrastructure to pursue spiritual goals. However, this alignment also provoked criticism. Observers accused the movement of “blurring the line between the gospel and nationalism,” especially in its use of state language and nationalistic rhetoric. Nonetheless, Kim’s approach reflected a pragmatic theology—one that prioritized the evangelization of the nation over political neutrality. In his own words, “Rather than clinging to political neutrality, the church must engage even unbelievers for the sake of the gospel. We are called to be the light of the world, not to isolate ourselves.”\n\nKim’s sense of mission was deeply rooted in his personal history of suffering. Born in 1925 in Shinan County, Jeolla Province, he grew up in poverty and witnessed multiple family tragedies. “He saw his cousin freeze to death, another sibling die from burns, and another struck dead by a falling tree,” and later, during the Korean War, his father and wife were killed by communist forces. These experiences, rather than crushing him, solidified his commitment to a divine vision: “It was then that I fully gave my life to the Lord and received the vision of national evangelization as my personal mission.” This vision was sharpened during his time in Manchuria in 1944, where, in hiding from Japanese conscription, he encountered Kim In-seok, a holiness pastor with a personal library of over 2,000 volumes. There, Kim combined fasting and study, forming a theology that was both intellectually rigorous and spiritually fervent. He later stated that “evangelization means giving every person a chance to believe in Jesus, discipling believers to become disciple-makers, and allowing the gospel to transform culture, society, and the nation.”\n\nKim’s theological grounding was also shaped by his resistance to liberal theology. Initially enrolled at Chosun Theological Seminary, he left due to its modernist tendencies and transferred to Korea Theological Seminary in Busan, where he studied under Dr. Hyung Ryong Park. Kim became a staunch proponent of Reformed evangelicalism, upholding “the authority of Scripture and the sovereignty of Christ.” This theological foundation later informed the structure of CCC’s national and global missions.\n\nThe 1970s also saw Kim develop two distinctive strategies for realizing his vision: the Holy City Movement (Sungshihwa) and EXPLO '74. The Holy City Movement, launched in Chuncheon in 1972, was inspired by two models: John Calvin’s Geneva and the martyr-evangelist Moon Jun-gyeong. Kim envisioned the church as a \"moral city center\" that would meet both the spiritual and material needs of citizens. He stated, “Chuncheon should become a model city where God’s sovereignty reaches every domain—like Calvin’s Geneva.” Moon’s example of sacrificial ministry among the poor and unchurched deeply shaped Kim’s belief that the church should serve the entire city, not just its members.\n\nThus, Kim’s national evangelization strategy fused rigorous theology, personal tragedy, and a profound vision of national redemption. It sought to turn Korea into a “Jesus nation,” not through coercion, but through discipleship, spiritual renewal, and social transformation. His message was one of total gospelization—a cultural, national, and global campaign in which the gospel of Jesus Christ would reign over every sphere of life.\n\n\n안병무  安炳茂  Byung-mu Ahn\n\n06/23/1922 ~ 10/19/1996\n\n\nAhn Byung-mu emerged in the 1970s as a theological revolutionary who faced the Yushin regime and military dictatorship head-on. In 1972, his short article “Jesus and Minjung” introduced ochlos (ὄχλος) as a theological category, boldly declaring that the minjung are the true historical subject and that Jesus is found among them. He recalled, “I did not see the suffering of the minjung as individual suffering, but as collective. Under the dictatorship, I thought everyone was minjung.”\n\nIn 1975, with the publication of The Liberator Jesus, he made his theology of minjung more explicit, confronting state violence and reclaiming the narrative of Jesus not as a metaphysical savior, but as a historical event of liberation. In 1976, Ahn was arrested for participating in the March 1st Declaration for National Salvation, underscoring the indivisibility of his theology and political praxis.\n\nHis theological praxis was grounded in institutional and intellectual strategy. During this decade, Ahn founded the Korea Theological Study Institute, which served as the base for organizing and expanding minjung theology. It was not simply a research center but a “space that not only led theological discourse in the 1970s and 1980s but also created a unique tradition of Korean academic theology that could be presented globally.”\n\nAhn’s concept of minjung transcended time and place. He regarded the colonized under Japanese rule, postwar rural migrants, and those oppressed under the Yushin regime as all expressions of the same historical subject. As he explained, minjung represented “those who suffer across historical contexts—collectively bearing the burden of history.” The Ahn of the 1970s was not merely a thinker but a prophetic voice—one who bridged faith, resistance, and the suffering people. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\nKorea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC)\n\n\nThe activities of Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) Korea before and after the 1970s reshaped the trajectory of Korean evangelicalism and served as a leading case of fusing evangelism with national mission. Led by Rev. Joon Gon Kim, CCC went beyond being a mere campus ministry to become the strategic command center of the national evangelization movement, implementing a theology and practice that fused evangelical faith with nationalistic aspirations. Amid political polarization and denominational divisions, CCC promoted unity through evangelism and simultaneously engaged with social and public concerns, leaving a deep impact both within the church and in broader society.\n\nThe emergence of CCC occurred against the backdrop of late-1960s turmoil in Korea—political instability, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the Yushin Constitution, and church division over WCC membership. In this climate, Rev. Joon Gon Kim proclaimed, “Only the gospel can save the nation,” and envisioned evangelization as the pathway to national renewal.\n\nIn 1965, the National Evangelization Movement was launched by prominent Christian leaders such as Kim Hwal-lan, Han Kyung-chik, and Kim Joon Gon, under the slogan “Thirty Million to Christ.” This campaign became the first nationwide strategy for organized, cross-sectoral evangelism targeting urban centers, villages, students, the military, children, and overseas Koreans. CCC played a key role by managing leadership training, developing evangelistic materials, and coordinating local rallies. It was “an ecumenical evangelistic movement that transcended theological divisions,” forging rare unity among conservative and progressive Protestants.\n\nIn 1972, CCC launched the Holy City Movement to evangelize Korea’s cities, which culminated in EXPLO ’74, the largest evangelistic rally in Korean history, held at Yeouido Plaza with over 1.5 million attendees. This event showcased CCC Korea’s unparalleled organizational capacity and passion for national evangelization to the global church. It was not merely a revival meeting, but the culmination of CCC’s discipleship training systems, local church partnerships, and mass-media-based evangelism strategies.\n\nCCC’s efforts within the church professionalized evangelism and discipleship. Many local churches adopted CCC’s training models or participated in joint events that helped them grow. After the Holy City Movement, CCC envisioned a church presence in every gospel-saturated city and developed “strategic partnerships” with churches to that end. Many churches even appointed CCC-trained student leaders to leadership roles. However, CCC’s use of anti-communist language and association with national development ideologies also created friction with progressive Protestant sectors.\n\nIn the 1970s, CCC was not merely a gospel-proclaiming body but functioned as a “national evangelical movement” that articulated theological critiques of society through a mission-centered lens. Rev. Joon Gon Kim proclaimed, “Democratization without evangelization is a mere façade, and nationalism without God is a hollow illusion,” firmly rejecting political reform without spiritual transformation. CCC laid the groundwork for Korean evangelical nationalism that would shape the theology and praxis of churches in the 1980s, linking gospel, nation, and youth into a single narrative of Christian identity.\n\n\nTable 1.

Under the authoritarian rule of President Park Chung Hee, South Korea experienced rapid state-led economic growth, but beneath the surface lay widespread labor exploitation, growing socioeconomic inequality, and political repression. In response, KSCF rejected a narrow, evangelistic focus and took the lead in embodying the social responsibility of faith, driven by young people’s yearning to “establish God’s justice on earth.”\n\nFormed in 1969 through the unification of the university division of the Korea Student Christian Council (KSCC) and the university YMCA, KSCF was rooted in ecumenical theology and the global Christian youth movement. Influenced by the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Student Christian Movement (SCM), KSCF embraced the idea of a “responsible society” and sought to respond faithfully to the injustices embedded in the social structure. A pivotal turning point came on November 13, 1970, when a young garment worker, Jeon Tae-il, self-immolated in protest against harsh labor conditions in the Peace Market. His death shocked Korean society and compelled Christian students to re-examine how the gospel could be lived out in the real world.\n\nKSCF immediately responded theologically and communally to Jeon’s death. During a public theology lecture series organized by the Yonsei University Divinity School, KSCF Secretary General Oh Jae-sik discarded his prepared remarks to share news of Jeon’s death and interpreted it as a sacrifice akin to Christ’s crucifixion. In the December 1970 issue of Christian Thought, he published an essay titled “A Certain Jesus’ Death,” asserting that “Jeon’s death was the crucifixion of Jesus in our time”. His statement provoked intense backlash from conservative Protestant circles, and Oh reportedly faced physical threats as a result. KSCF’s response did not stop at theological interpretation but extended to tangible actions. Shortly after Jeon’s death, KSCF co-organized an interdenominational memorial service at Yeondong Church with Pax Romana (the Catholic university student association), the Urban Industrial Mission Practitioners’ Council, and the Catholic Workers’ Youth Movement (JOC). At the service, a “Confession of Commitment” was read, repenting for societal sins that led to Jeon’s death and calling Christians to solidarity with workers. At Saemunan Church, university students held a fasting prayer vigil, and students from the Methodist and Presbyterian seminaries issued public statements, affirming that true Christian faith must stand with the suffering.\n\nIn tandem with these actions, KSCF intensified its Student Community Development Corps (Haksa-dan), a program launched in 1969. Based on the community organizing theories of Saul Alinsky in the United States, this program mobilized small groups of Christian students to live and work alongside marginalized communities—including factory workers, slum residents, and rural laborers—embodying a form of social discipleship rooted in practical faith. Jeon Tae-il’s death further galvanized the program, as students increasingly viewed solidarity with the oppressed as an essential expression of their faith. These efforts positioned KSCF as a key actor in laying the theological and social foundations for South Korea’s democratization movement in the 1970s. Rather than merely advocating progressive theology, KSCF implemented a praxis of prayer, solidarity, and structural transformation. Theologian Kim Myung-bae noted that “KSCF was the community that most radically socialized faith, serving as a bridge between the democratization movement and the church”. These efforts contributed to later movements such as the Urban Industrial Mission and Minjung theology, as well as to the broader pro-democracy movement of the 1980s.\n\nMore importantly, KSCF demonstrated that faith and democracy, gospel and justice, were not mutually exclusive. Its members pursued a life of witness rooted in the conviction that “the justice of God’s Kingdom is found among the poor and the suffering.” This path often led to hardship and rejection, but it also revealed a prophetic possibility for church reform and hope for Christian engagement in society. KSCF’s religious praxis thus forged a vital bridge between the democratization movement and the Korean church. In the face of state violence and church silence under the Yushin regime, Christian students reinterpreted faith as a public vocation and embraced justice for the marginalized as a core gospel imperative. They argued that the church must go beyond worship halls to walk alongside the suffering in workplaces, back alleys, and rural villages. KSCF did not engage in abstract ideology but lived out its theology in acts of solidarity, showing that the church could stand on the side of justice rather than complacency. In doing so, KSCF helped shape the moral language of Korean democracy and embodied the possibility that the church could become an agent of social transformation.\n\n\nTable 2.

While KSCC represents the earlier ecumenical and social engagement-oriented student movement, KSCF emerged as a renewal and expansion of this tradition with a stronger emphasis on field-based social practice and democratization. In contrast, Korea CCC followed a distinctly evangelical path with an emphasis on personal salvation and cooperation with state-led modernization.\n\n\nNational Council of Churches in Korea\n\n\nIn the politically repressive atmosphere of 1970s South Korea, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) emerged as the primary ecumenical voice resisting the Park Chung Hee regime. Theologically rooted in the Missio Dei framework, the NCCK emphasized that God's mission included not only spiritual salvation but also justice, peace, and liberation from structural sin. This theological commitment led to a series of public declarations which had both theological depth and political urgency.\n\nThe 1973 \"Declaration of Korean Christians\" was a pivotal moment in Korean Protestant resistance. While anonymous due to the threat of government retaliation, the declaration prophetically denounced the Yushin regime, declaring, \"What moves us today is not the expectation of victory, but a confession of guilt before God.\" This statement framed resistance as a spiritual imperative and denounced the October Yushin (1972) as a betrayal of both the nation and Christian conscience.\n\nFollowing this, the 1974 \"Theological Declaration of Korean Christians\" articulated a more developed theological rationale for church participation in social liberation. It emphasized that salvation must be understood holistically, addressing not only individual sin but also systemic injustice. This declaration explicitly challenged the church to stand with the marginalized and to reject complicity with oppressive structures.\n\nThe NCCK's actions were situated within a broader context of Christian nationalism and revivalist fervor. Movements such as the Minjok Bogeumhwa (National Evangelization Movement), spearheaded by figures like Kim Joon Gon, aimed to use Christian revivalism as a means of national renewal. Mass rallies like Billy Graham's 1973 crusade and Explo '74 were held in state-managed spaces like Yeouido Plaza with government approval, revealing a strategic alliance between revivalist Protestantism and the anti-communist state apparatus.\n\nWhile the NCCK maintained a prophetic critique of state power, other segments of the Protestant church engaged in the national evangelization project as a means to bolster a sense of Christian nationalism. The theological framing of Minjok (ethnic nation) as an object of salvation and the strategic deployment of mass revival events functioned to blur the line between nationalism and evangelism. Kim Joon Gon famously declared on January 1, 1971: \"There is no faster and better way to the reunification of the two Koreas and the well-being of the nation than the mobilization of two million Christians to achieve a national revolution through evangelism.\"\n\nIn contrast, the NCCK’s 1973 and 1974 declarations emphasized solidarity with the oppressed and theological critique of militarized power. These statements laid the groundwork for Minjung Theology, which interpreted the gospel through the suffering and agency of the oppressed Korean masses. The emphasis on God's preferential option for the poor represented a significant departure from the state-aligned nationalism of revivalist evangelicals.\n\nThus, the 1970s witnessed a theological divergence within Korean Protestantism. On one side stood the NCCK, articulating a liberationist vision rooted in justice and solidarity; on the other, a state-aligned revivalist movement that sacralized nation-building and anti-communism as spiritual mandates.\n\n\nSummary of the Declaration of Korean Christians (1973)\n\nWe, as Korean Christians, issue this declaration in response to the oppressive political climate following the Yushin Constitution of October 17, 1972. Recognizing the risks involved, we choose to remain anonymous.\n\nConfession of Faith: We believe that Christians are called by God to stand with the oppressed, proclaim the truth, and participate in social and political reform.\n\nCritique of the Regime: We denounce the authoritarian rule, suppression of conscience and religious freedom, media manipulation, political persecution, and economic injustice perpetrated by the current government.\n\nCall to Action: We urge the rejection of laws and policies that disregard the sovereignty of the people and call for national solidarity to restore democracy.\n\nAppeal for Global Solidarity: We request prayers and support from the global Christian community, emphasizing our shared commitment to justice and peace.\n\n\nSummary of the Theological Declaration of Korean Christians (1974)\n\nOn November 18, 1974, sixty-six theologians and pastors issued this declaration, articulating the church's theological stance and social responsibility:\n\nHolistic Understanding of Salvation: Salvation encompasses not only the forgiveness of individual sins but also liberation from oppressive social structures.\n\nRole of the Church: The church must stand in solidarity with the oppressed and lead efforts to realize justice and peace.\n\nCritique of Government: We denounce the unjust intervention of state power and the human rights violations resulting from flawed economic structures.\n\nTheological Foundation: We affirm that through the work of the Holy Spirit, we are called to participate in creating a new society and history.\n\n\nKorean Christian Professors Association (KCPA)\n\n\nIn the turbulent political landscape of 1970s South Korea, the Korean Christian Professors Association (KCPA) emerged not merely as a gathering of Protestant intellectuals but as a theological vanguard actively responding to authoritarianism and social injustice. The KCPA, founded in 1966 in the spirit of the ecumenical movement, quickly became a crucible for theological engagement with Korea’s socio-political realities. Its members, many of whom were influenced by global ecumenical trends and theologies of liberation, particularly WCC’s theology of humanization, laid the groundwork for what would later become Minjung theology. This intellectual and theological ferment gave rise to a faith practice that was not only doctrinal but also deeply political.\n\nThe theological commitment of the KCPA centered on a vision of human liberation grounded in the Gospel. As Koh Ji Soo notes, the movement’s core was an “attempt to theologically reconstitute the people alienated in the process of industrialization as subjects of labor and production” through the concept of Minjung theology, which he categorizes as a “discourse of theological humanization.” This humanization was not abstract but deeply embodied in Korea’s historical context, where the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee enacted sweeping economic reforms that deepened inequalities and provoked democratic resistance. In such a setting, theology, for the members of KCPA, became a means to interpret and transform the world.\n\nThe association’s influence was not confined to academic circles. As the Yushin Constitution was enacted in 1972 and the government enforced a series of Emergency Measures, many KCPA-affiliated professors were forcibly dismissed from their posts. These “dismissed intellectuals” would later form the core of the “Association of Dismissed Professors,” which actively collaborated with Christian student and youth movements, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), and urban-industrial missions. This realignment gave rise to a more engaged form of Christian activism rooted in theological conviction. As Jeong Byeongjun observes, the KCPA became “an intellectual body that contributed to Korea’s democratization movement and Christian social movement by offering theological and ideological resources.”\n\nAt the heart of the KCPA’s theological reorientation was the work of theologian Seo Nam-dong, whose writings powerfully articulated the vision of Minjung as the historic and salvific subject of Korea. Seo did not view the Minjung simply as pitiable victims, but as the true agents of divine history. “The Minjung,” he insisted, “must be recognized as the most significant historical subject in the redemptive work of God, and the Bible must be read anew in the language of the Minjung.” Seo’s interpretation called for a radical redefinition of the church’s role—not as a custodian of tradition, but as a suffering companion of the oppressed.\n\nSuch theological redefinitions found resonance in major events of the 1970s. The 1973 “Korean Christian Declaration” (한국기독교인 선언) and the subsequent 1974 “Theological Declaration of Korean Christians” (한국그리스도인의 신학적 성명) were landmarks in Christian political witness. Composed largely by KCPA-affiliated theologians such as Kim Yong-bok, Kim Kwan-seok, and Seo Nam-dong, these declarations accused the Yushin regime of “betraying the people,” asserting that Christian participation in democratic resistance was “a command of God, a demand of the people, and a historic tradition of the church.” These documents served to theologically legitimize Christian engagement in Korea’s democratization process, and were clandestinely printed and distributed with the blessing of NCCK’s general secretary.\n\nThe integration of theology and political engagement reached a critical juncture with the Mincheonghakryeon (Democratic Youth and Student Federation) incident in 1974. Following a fabricated conspiracy by the state, over 1,000 students were interrogated and more than 200 arrested, including 26 core members of the KSCF (Korean Student Christian Federation). Christian professors, including many from the KCPA, not only supported the students spiritually and materially, but also played a public role in defending their human rights. As the repression intensified, “the NCCK Human Rights Committee became a cradle of ecumenical human rights activism, allowing the church to transcend denominational barriers and stand with the persecuted.”\n\nDespite the regime’s persistent efforts to suppress dissent, KCPA and its partners in the ecumenical movement received significant international solidarity. Organizations such as the WCC, the CCA (Christian Conference of Asia), and various German and Japanese churches provided spiritual, financial, and material support to the Korean Christian resistance. The role of these ecumenical alliances was critical, as “without the international funds and networks, the Korean ecumenical movement in the 1970s and 80s could not have survived.” These transnational connections allowed Korean Christian intellectuals to frame their struggle not merely as a national issue but as part of a global fight for justice.\n\nUltimately, the KCPA’s theological-political praxis represents a unique moment in Korean church history when theology became praxis, and intellectual discourse translated into prophetic action. Theirs was a radical fidelity—to the Gospel, to the people, and to justice in history. Through the work of theologians like Seo Nam-dong and their collaboration with student, labor, and ecumenical groups, the KCPA helped redefine Korean Christianity in a moment of national crisis. They showed that theology could be, and must be, lived in the streets, prisons, and classrooms of a nation under dictatorship.\n\n\nKorean Church Women United (KCWU)\n\n\nThe Korean Church Women United (KCWU) emerged in the 1970s as a prophetic ecumenical force that amplified the silenced voices of women marginalized by the developmentalist ideology of the Park Chung-hee regime.\n\nTheir activities directly confronted the violence and exploitation hidden beneath South Korea’s “modernization of the fatherland” narrative, particularly the commodification of women through state-led sex tourism and the systemic neglect of Korean women affected by the atomic bomb. Lim Hee-sook characterizes this movement as a theological awakening in which women realized that “they, among all people, were the most oppressed under the structure of division” and responded with collective action grounded in faith.\n\nA defining moment came in December 1973, when KCWU hosted a seminar titled “The Problem of Tourists and Prostituted Women”, addressing the rise of sex tourism marketed to Japanese men. The organization released a public statement condemning the state’s complicity: “The economic-first development policy is not only making our nation a virtual colony of Japan but also commodifying Korean women under the guise of tourism promotion.” This act transformed a stigmatized issue into a systemic critique of patriarchal capitalism and marked one of the first public theological denunciations of the Korean state’s use of women’s bodies for profit.\n\nIn the late 1970s, KCWU expanded its focus to include Japanese atomic bomb victims in Korea, especially women whose lives were marked by radiation sickness, social ostracism, and intergenerational suffering. KCWU’s collaboration with Japanese Christian organizations to conduct field investigations gave voice to these women, setting a precedent for future campaigns around the “comfort women” issue. These efforts created the first public platform where such women could speak and be heard—a theological and political breakthrough. As Ko Seong-hwi notes, KCWU’s actions were “not merely humanitarian acts of Christian charity but a direct challenge to patriarchal modernization itself.” Their initiatives redefined Christian women’s activism from church-based charity work to critical engagement with national policy, gendered violence, and global justice.\n\nAccording to Lim’s broader analysis, KCWU’s role in the 1970s marked a paradigm shift in Protestant women’s education and empowerment. Transitioning from traditional evangelism-focused teachings to feminist theology and social engagement, KCWU “enabled women to become subjects of social participation and ecclesial reform.” They embraced a theological understanding of mission not confined to church walls but extending into the world, especially to sites of suffering and exclusion.\n\nKCWU's theological praxis proclaimed that “God’s mission begins not within the sanctuary, but at the margins.” Their work throughout the 1970s contributed significantly to South Korea’s democratization, the Christian feminist movement, and the emergence of human rights advocacy in both church and civil society. They exemplified what it meant to make the body—the most vulnerable site of modern exploitation—a medium of gospel testimony.\n\n\nCatholic Farmers’ Movement (CFM) and Catholic Women Farmers’ Association (CWFA)\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Catholic Farmers’ Movement (CFM) and the Catholic Women Farmers’ Association (CWFA) emerged as faith-based grassroots movements in response to the structural collapse of rural communities caused by rapid industrialization and urban concentration, the political marginalization of farmers, and the compounded oppression of women farmers. These organizations functioned not merely as relief or welfare bodies, but as autonomous collectives aiming to awaken consciousness, organize the rural population, and expose structural injustices. Their work was rooted in diocesan pastoral networks, national coordination, and international partnerships, establishing an alternative model for rural solidarity and cooperation.\n\nThe Catholic Farmers’ Movement originated in 1966 as a rural division of the Catholic Young Workers' Movement and was officially renamed “Catholic Farmers’ Movement” in 1972, expanding its structure into a national rural network. The principal agents of the movement were young farmers, clergy, and rural pastoral workers. Through publishing activities like the journal Nongchon Cheongnyeon (Rural Youth), the movement critically assessed rural realities and denounced state-led policies such as the Saemaul (New Village) Movement and the government’s focus on large-scale farming. As Park Kyung-yeon writes, “The Catholic Farmers’ Movement made it clear that the Church’s role was to realize social justice, and that proper action to achieve this was an appropriate posture,” emphasizing the fusion of religious ethics with socio-political engagement.\n\nOne of the CFM’s most impactful activities was the Rice Production Cost Survey, launched in 1975, which aimed to empirically demonstrate the real costs of rice production by having farmers themselves record detailed data in diary-like formats. This allowed farmers to reclaim recognition of their economic value and critique structural inequalities. According to the research, “Farmers, unlike before, gained confidence and strength... and began raising questions about the irrational agricultural structure and even the political system.” In addition, in the diocese of Wonju, the CFM cooperated with the Disaster Relief Committee to establish credit unions in rural communities. These credit unions, or Shinhyups, not only offered financial services but also engaged in the cooperative production, distribution, and consumption of goods. According to Kim So-nam, “By taking the lead in village governance, credit union officers brought about shifts in local political structures,” thereby democratizing village power that had been dominated by government-backed organizations. These activities, though sometimes parallel to government-led rural policies, represented a distinct and autonomous grassroots model of development.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Women Farmers’ Association was launched in 1977 under the original name “Catholic Rural Women’s Association,” with the goal of empowering women in agriculture and rural life. The inaugural president, Kim Young-ja, declared that “the rural women’s movement is not merely a women’s rights movement but one that tackles agricultural issues at their core… by confronting structural contradictions from the perspective of rural women and offering human dignity-based education and organizing.” The CWFA identified the dual burdens faced by women farmers—agricultural labor and domestic work—as well as the gender-based discrimination embedded within both rural and urban systems. Through their periodical Nongchon Bunya (Rural Women), they engaged in consciousness-raising work and advocated for recognition of women’s roles and rights. Rather than merely asserting women's rights, the CWFA advanced programs for political participation, educational access, and community engagement. One of their symbolic achievements was the 1985 \"Cattle Drive Protest,\" in which women farmers drove cattle into urban areas to protest agricultural policy—an event regarded as the “starting point of women-led farmers’ movements.” The CWFA laid the foundation for the creation of the National Association of Women Farmers in 1989.\n\nBoth organizations shared a common foundation in Catholic social teaching and emphasized consciousness-raising and grassroots organizing. While the CFM focused on cooperatives, cost surveys, and production reform, the CWFA introduced gender perspectives into the farmers’ movement, expanding its scope and constituency.\n\n\nTable 3.

This marked the formal launch of a movement that envisioned evangelism not simply as a matter of personal salvation, but as a collective mission for national spiritual renewal. Kim’s vision was that Korea as a whole should be reached, healed, and transformed by the gospel. This declaration led to a series of nationwide campaigns, beginning with the Chuncheon Holy City Movement and culminating in the historic EXPLO ’74 rally.\n\nThe National Evangelization Movement arose from a convergence of political tension, social transformation, and religious expansion in 1970s Korea. Politically, the Yushin Constitution of 1972 solidified Park Chung Hee's authoritarian regime. Despite its repressive mechanisms, the state permitted a degree of religious freedom when aligned with anti-communist nationalism. The evangelical rhetoric of national moral regeneration complemented the regime’s political ideology, allowing the movement to flourish under tacit approval. Economically and socially, Korea was undergoing rapid industrialization and urban migration, which caused the disintegration of traditional community structures. This left many individuals, particularly in urban slums, in search of new identities and social anchors. Churches stepped into this vacuum, offering a narrative of restoration and spiritual belonging. Religiously, Protestant churches had grown rapidly but were grappling with questions of public engagement. Theologians and church leaders debated whether faith should remain inward or engage with society. Kim Joon Gon reframed this debate by declaring that “the gospel is not complete until it transforms the nation,” thus providing theological legitimacy for mass mobilization.\n\nThe movement’s growth was marked by high-profile campaigns and strategic initiatives that integrated local and global evangelical networks. EXPLO ’74 was the most iconic event. Held in Seoul’s Yeouido Plaza and co-hosted by Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) and Billy Graham, the event drew over a million participants and marked Korea’s emergence as a global evangelical center. It symbolized the scale, ambition, and momentum of the movement. Equally influential was the Chuncheon-based Holy City Movement, launched in 1972. Inspired by Calvin’s Geneva and the ministry of Mun Jun Kyung, Kim Joon Gon envisioned “holistic evangelization,” where churches would spiritually and materially serve entire cities. This strategy emphasized community transformation and civic morality alongside individual salvation.\n\nThe success of the movement was underpinned by the fusion of theological conviction, political accommodation, cultural resonance, and organizational strategy. Theologically, Kim promoted an eschatological narrative in which Korea was a “chosen nation” destined to play a redemptive role in world missions. This “Second Israel” framing made the nation's history of suffering meaningful within a broader salvific story. Politically, the movement benefited from the regime’s indirect support. The government's anti-communist nationalism and desire for social cohesion meant that mass evangelical activities were tolerated, even when not explicitly endorsed. Culturally, the postwar generations were deeply affected by national division, war, and identity loss. The movement provided a unifying spiritual narrative that redefined minjok (the Korean nation) not only ethnically but as a sacred community. Strategically, CCC employed globally developed tools such as the Four Spiritual Laws and small-group discipleship, adapting them to Korean society. Their student networks, lay training, and mobilization tactics made the movement replicable and sustainable nationwide.\n\nThe movement left a transformative legacy on Korean Christianity and public life, despite facing criticism in later years. Within the church, it cemented the norm of mass evangelism and institutionalized lay ministry. CCC’s influence spread into nearly every major denomination, shaping a generation of church leaders and youth ministries. Socially, the movement modeled a form of public theology that envisioned civic life shaped by the gospel. The Holy City Movement, for instance, sought to moralize urban governance, improve public ethics, and embody Christian values in everyday life. However, critics have pointed out its limitations. Its spiritual-nationalist framework aligned too easily with authoritarian ideologies, and it largely avoided engagement with the democratization and human rights movements of the late 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, its cultural and theological impact on the Korean Protestant imagination is undeniable.\n\n\nCatholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) 천주교정의구현사제단\n\nThe Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) emerged in 1970s South Korea as a transformative force in the relationship between religion and politics, forging a new path for the church as a moral agent amid authoritarian rule and institutional silence. More than a reaction to political oppression, its founding and activities reflected a theologically grounded commitment to conscience and justice. The CPAJ was not merely a group of dissenting clergy; it embodied a significant theological movement within Korean Catholicism that asserted the prophetic role of the Church in the public sphere.\n\nThe catalyst for its formation was the arrest of Bishop Ji Hak-sun of the Wonju Diocese on July 6, 1974. He had been detained by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) for allegedly providing funds to poet Kim Chi-ha, who was arrested in connection with the People's Revolutionary Party (Mincheong) incident. Days later, on July 23, Bishop Ji delivered a public “Declaration of Conscience” from the garden of the hospital where he was under house arrest, proclaiming: “I have worked for human dignity and social justice; if that is a crime, I accept responsibility.”This statement reverberated throughout the Catholic community and galvanized younger priests to action, culminating in the organization of “National Prayer Meetings to Save the Nation.”\n\nBishop Ji’s arrest was more than a political incident; it was a theological rupture. For the first time, a senior church leader openly defied the regime, asserting that spiritual responsibility included ethical and political judgment. In response, priests across the country organized themselves under the banner of “justice,” and on September 26, 1974, the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice was officially founded. In a remarkable act of civil disobedience, priests led a procession with a cross at its forefront through the streets of Seoul following a Mass at Myeongdong Cathedral, marking the first street protest led by Catholic clergy in Korean history.\n\nTwo crucial factors shaped this development. First was the impact of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), which declared in Gaudium et Spes that “when the fundamental rights of people or the salvation of souls require it, the Church must pass moral judgment even in political matters”. Second was the increasingly repressive climate of the 1970s under President Park Chung-hee, which saw not only civil liberties curtailed but also the surveillance and persecution of religious organizations. The CPAJ interpreted these acts as violations not just of civil rights but of religious conscience, arguing, “There can be no preaching of the Gospel without justice and freedom”.\n\nOrganizationally, the CPAJ functioned as a loosely connected nationwide network of priests, but their actions were coordinated and symbolically powerful. The primary mode of resistance was the national prayer meeting, which served as both a liturgical and political space. From 1974 through 1980, over 200 such meetings were held across the country, aligned with campaigns against the Yushin Constitution, for the release of political prisoners, and in support of direct presidential elections. Their statements consistently called for the release of conscience prisoners, protection of basic human rights, freedom of religion, and economic justice for the people.\n\nImportantly, the CPAJ’s actions were not uniformly supported within the institutional Church. While the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Korea did not overtly oppose the group, it often remained cautious or silent, maintaining internal balance between progressive and conservative factions. Nonetheless, many within the Church acknowledged that the CPAJ contributed to a “renewed social trust in Catholicism,” particularly among students and intellectuals. Some even noted that the Church’s membership, which had stagnated in the early 1970s, began to increase partly due to the CPAJ’s visible commitment to justice.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the CPAJ had become one of the most respected moral voices in Korean society. Their acts—priests marching with crosses, defying state violence—captured the national imagination and elevated the Catholic Church to a central place in the democratization movement. As one priest stated, “Justice is part of evangelism; standing with the oppressed is the practice of the Gospel itself”.\n\nThe CPAJ’s legacy in 1970s Korea is not simply a record of reactive protest. It is an emblem of how faith, conscience, and theology can become the basis for structural critique and ethical resistance. Through its work, the CPAJ provided a model for how the Church could resist authoritarianism not by abandoning its mission but by embodying it more fully. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nAnti-corruption Campaign by Catholic Churches\n\n\nThe anti-corruption campaign led by Bishop Ji Hak-sun in the early 1970s in the Diocese of Wonju was not merely a local protest against a single case of mismanagement; it was a turning point in the Catholic Church’s engagement with authoritarian politics in Korea. This movement, sparked by righteous indignation at institutional corruption, became a catalyst for nationwide democratic activism and transformed the role of the Church in society.\n\nThe catalyst for this movement was the corruption scandal surrounding Wonju MBC, in which the Diocese of Wonju was a minority shareholder. The station’s majority stakeholder, the 5.16 Scholarship Foundation, held 60% of the shares but failed to ensure transparent governance. Despite Bishop Ji's repeated protests, the government and the foundation ignored his demands for reform. This blatant disregard for justice ignited a deeper moral realization in Ji: “If a bishop can be treated like this, how much more would ordinary people suffer?” This experience awakened in him a sense of pastoral duty that transcended the sacristy and entered the realm of social justice.\n\nFrom righteous indignation emerged a bold and public campaign to confront institutionalized corruption. Bishop Ji organized public marches and protests demanding transparency, justice, and the eradication of entrenched political corruption. This was a courageous act during the height of the Park Chung-hee military regime, where dissent was often met with severe consequences. By directly challenging both the state and the colluding elites, Ji’s movement became the first visible sign of organized Catholic resistance to the dictatorship.\n\nBishop Ji’s anti-corruption movement evolved into a broader spiritual and political mission that called the entire Church to accountability. What began as a protest against a single instance of corruption quickly became a moral confrontation with the foundations of military authoritarianism. Ji recognized that the Church’s mission was not to retreat into spiritual neutrality but to speak out against injustice. His conviction was that “the Church must enter into society, understand its people, and give a Gospel-based response to their suffering”.\n\nThe campaign's historical significance lies in its redefinition of the Church’s social role and its inspiration of a wider resistance movement. Ji Hak-sun's protests laid the foundation for the creation of the Catholic Priests' Association for Justice, which would later become one of the most organized religious forces opposing the dictatorship. This movement also pushed the Catholic Church out of its previous posture of political detachment, bringing it into direct alignment with the struggles of the oppressed in Korean society.\n\nBy daring to speak truth to power in the face of systemic corruption, Bishop Ji’s campaign marked the beginning of a new era in Korean Christianity—an era where faith and justice walked hand in hand. His stance proved that pastoral care includes not only spiritual guidance but also the defense of human dignity against state oppression. The anti-corruption movement in the Diocese of Wonju thus serves not just as a protest, but as a prophetic voice in Korea’s modern democratic history.\n\n\nUrban Industrial Mission (UIM) and its Misson\n\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) in 1970s Korea was not merely a Christian outreach organization but a structured movement, representing a convergence of religion, social activism, and practical theology. Rooted in regionally autonomous mission stations like the Youngdeungpo Industrial Mission (YIM) and the Incheon Christian Urban Industrial Mission, this movement expanded beyond traditional evangelism to promote human dignity and industrial democracy in an era of rapid economic growth and labor exploitation. These regional missions functioned as decentralized but organized entities, linked through international ecumenical networks such as the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Leaders like Cho Ji-song, George Ogle, Jo Seung-hyeok, and Jo Hwa-soon moved into the factories, working and living alongside laborers, enacting what was called \"incarnational theology.\" Their mission was not merely to proclaim the gospel but to embody it through solidarity and structural transformation. As Cho Ji-song once critically confessed, “factory ministry itself was a mechanism of oppression that disciplined workers”. Importantly, the UIM reframed its target subjects—not as passive receivers of aid or faith but as co-agents of the mission. The Youngdeungpo Mission even rejected the traditional church hierarchy, declaring that “the worker is the church and the factory is the sanctuary.” This radical theology emerged from deep self-reflection on the limits of church language and ministry. As Jo Seung-hyeok testified, “Church language is a jargon understood only by believers—it has no meaning for workers”.\n\nSeveral landmark events during the 1970s clarified the Urban Industrial Mission’s character as a movement rather than merely an organization. The 1970 self-immolation of Jeon Tae-il, a garment worker protesting labor conditions, deeply shocked mission pastors. It catalyzed a theological shift from church-centered outreach to direct immersion in workers' lives. The Incheon Mission's Jo Seung-hyeok, who had worked undercover as a factory laborer, declared that the gospel must emerge from the lived experience of suffering.\n\nThe 1971 Kim Jin-su Incident at Han-young Textile, where the company’s hired thugs murdered a union member, also confirmed that the mission’s role was not neutral. The Incheon Mission responded by severing ties with its denomination and establishing an independent workers' church, committed to deeper engagement. In 1974, George Ogle’s forced deportation—after he publicly criticized the Park Chung-hee regime and prayed for the release of political prisoners—demonstrated the political cost of the mission's prophetic witness. His statement that “the government must abandon the constitution and build a new democracy” led to his removal, which stirred international human rights discourse.\n\nThe structure and praxis of UIM are vividly reflected in Jo Se-hee’s 1978 novel The Dwarf, which documents the industrial mission’s educational and communal ethos through its portrayal of “Eun-kang Workers’ Church.” The character Young-su attends a six-month education program teaching labor history, law, theology, and political economy. He states: “I studied the structure of industrial society, human organization, labor law, labor history, and theology”—a direct parallel to the leadership courses offered by YIM and Incheon UIM.\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission, therefore, must be understood as a structured mission movement—combining regional organization, educational praxis, theological radicalism, international solidarity, and political resistance. The following chart summarizes the dimensions of the UIM and its ties to major events:\n\n\nTable 4. Structure and key Linkages of the UIM as a Structured Movement\n\n| Dimension | Content | Representative Example / Citation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Organizational Form | Regional decentralized structure + international ecumenical networks | YIM, Incheon UIM, WCC, CCA |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Core Agents | Industrial mission pastors (Cho Ji-song, Ogle, Jo Seung-hyeok, etc.), workers, international allies | \"The worker is the church\" principle |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Major Events | Jeon Tae-il’s death, Kim Jin-su incident, Ogle’s deportation, Dongil Textile struggle | _The Dwarf_ depiction of “Eun-kang” workers’ church |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mission Activities | Incarnational theology, workers’ education, union support, documentation, advocacy | “Six-month leadership program” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Theological Basis | Incarnation, liberation theology, industrial democracy | “God dwells in the factory” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Social Significance | Worker empowerment, democratic resistance, church-society bridge | Separation from denominations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission of 1970s Korea represented a rare and radical convergence of gospel, justice, and social embodiment. By redefining mission as solidarity with the suffering and transformation of the structural sin of industrial capitalism, it posed a prophetic alternative to both institutional religion and authoritarian power. It remains one of the most significant models of missional engagement in Korea’s modern Christian history.\n\n\nReconfiguring Denominational Identity through Mission\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a pivotal moment in South Korean Protestantism—not merely as a period of numerical growth but as a time when major denominations redefined their identities through mission-centered transformation. Faced with sociopolitical shifts, internal theological challenges, and new opportunities for expansion, the Korean Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches responded through organized evangelism campaigns, international cooperation, and hybrid domestic-global mission structures. These efforts reshaped not only their outreach strategies but also the theological, organizational, and cultural foundations of each denomination.\n\nFor the Korean Methodist Church, the late 1960s were marked by stagnation in membership growth and an overemphasis on social engagement theology, which limited evangelistic vigor. In response, the denomination launched the nationwide “Five Thousand Churches and One Million Believers Movement” in 1974. This large-scale campaign represented a radical attempt to realign denominational focus around mission and evangelism. Supported by a detailed organizational plan and numerical targets at the district and regional levels, the movement aimed to establish 5,000 new churches and attract one million members within ten years. Its core message—“a movement of repentance and rekindled zeal for evangelism in light of ninety years of Methodist history”—captured the urgency of reformation. Between 1972 and 1974, church membership rose by tens of thousands annually, peaking at 374,710 in 1974. However, in 1975, growth dropped to just 2,398 new members, and by 1985, only 2,839 new churches had been planted—barely half of the original goal. Critics highlighted the movement’s reliance on numerical benchmarks and its lack of focus on discipleship, calling attention to the structural limitations of campaign-style evangelism.\n\nThe Baptist Church, recovering from post-war institutional weakness, rapidly expanded its membership and presence through a strategic partnership with the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) of the United States. Two key events—the Louisiana Evangelistic Crusade (1970) and the Florida Crusade (1978)—defined this decade for Korean Baptists. In the 1970 Louisiana Crusade, 81 American pastors and laypeople collaborated with Korean Baptists across 20 cities, drawing an estimated 250,000 attendees and resulting in over 11,000 public confessions of faith. These large-scale evangelistic efforts significantly contributed to the growth of Baptist churches, which reached 1,797 congregations by 1992. However, questions soon arose regarding the long-term retention and spiritual growth of these converts. Scholars criticized the lack of follow-up and discipleship systems, exposing the tension between evangelistic quantity and pastoral quality. Nonetheless, these movements helped define the Korean Baptist Church as a mission-driven, evangelical denomination with strong international linkages.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church, particularly its two dominant branches—Hapdong (Conservative) and Tonghap (Moderate)—entered the 1970s amid ongoing denominational fragmentation and theological disputes. Nevertheless, both branches experienced significant growth during this period. Between 1976 and 1977, Tonghap gained 172,132 new members, while Hapdong added approximately 60,000. This growth was fueled by massive city-based revivals, prayer mountain gatherings, and the “One Million Souls for Christ” campaign. Simultaneously, the church began developing international mission efforts, dispatching missionaries to the Philippines, Japan, and the United States. Timothy Kiho Park characterizes this dual expansion as an “integrated structure of domestic growth and international outreach,” reflecting a hybrid mission identity for the Korean Presbyterian Church. However, the denomination also faced internal theological tension between revivalist-charismatic practices and doctrinal orthodoxy, as well as debates about ecumenism and denominational unity.\n\nTaken together, the 1970s were not merely a time of growth for Korean Protestantism but a decade of missional redefinition. Each denomination responded to internal and external challenges by embracing mission not only as a practice but as the central axis for rearticulating theological identity, organizational priorities, and global engagement. These missional experiments—whether campaign-driven, cooperation-based, or hybrid in structure—shaped the long-term character and trajectory of South Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nTable 5. Mission-Driven Denominational Identity Formation \n\n| Denomination | Major Mission Movement | Quantitative Indicators | Key Issues and Debates | Representative Quotation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Methodist | Five Thousand Churches, One Million Believers (1974) | 1972–1975 membership: 314,143 → 377,108;goal: 5,000 churches; actual: 2,839 | Campaign-style evangelism criticized for neglecting discipleship | “A movement of repentance and renewed zeal for evangelism” |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baptist | Louisiana & Florida Evangelistic Crusades (1970, 1978) | 1970: 11,000 confessions of faith;1992: 1,797 churches | High response but low follow-up; debates over quantity vs. quality | “The crusade recorded the highest number of decisions for Christ” |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Presbyterian | One Million Souls Campaign;Domestic & Overseas Mission Expansion | Tonghap added 172,132 members in 1976–77;Hapdong added ~60,000 | Charismatic revivalism vs. theological orthodoxy;debates over unity | “PCK’s mission expanded naturally from local growth to global reach” |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n \n\nAnti-Yushin Movement\n\n\nThe anti-Yushin movement of the Korean Christian Church (PROK) in the early 1970s was not a spontaneous reaction, but the culmination of a theological, organizational, and intellectual groundwork developed throughout the 1960s. At the core of this movement was the church’s conviction that faith could not be separated from freedom, justice, and resistance to tyranny.\n\nThe Korean Christian Church (PROK), emerging from a 1950s theological liberalism centered on Kim Jae-jun, had long emphasized ecumenical engagement and social mission theology. From its very inception, it promoted a version of Christianity that rejected privatized spirituality and emphasized collective, public witness. In 1964, marking its 10th anniversary, the denomination declared a need for \"self-criticism and reformation,\" urging a “church of confession” that could respond to the moral crises of the times. The denomination’s official statements throughout the 1960s and early 1970s—including the Guidelines for Church Education (1970), Social Declaration Guidelines (1971), Declaration of Faith (1972), and Mission Policy (1973)—reflect this shift toward public theology, culminating in a formalized theological resistance to state violence and authoritarianism.\n\nThe theological foundation of this resistance was deeply rooted in the concept of “Missio Dei” (God’s mission). The PROK stated that the church’s task was to participate in “God’s will and God’s mission as Creator, Judge, and Redeemer… to fulfill the apostolic role of the church in this age”. According to the church's Mission Policy, adopted in 1973, the purpose of mission was not merely evangelism but social transformation: “to make the Korean people new through Jesus Christ… and make this country into God’s kingdom”. This comprehensive theology of liberation, contextualization, and total mission (전선교) challenged the dominant evangelical revivalism of the 1970s, including events such as Explo ’74. The PROK formally distanced itself from such state-aligned mass crusades, denouncing them as spiritually shallow and politically complicit.\n\nAlongside its theology, the PROK mobilized an institutional network of clergy, professors, laypeople, and students—many trained at Chosun Seminary (later Korea Theological Seminary)—to engage in overt resistance. Key figures included Kim Kwan-suk, Park Hyung-kyu, Moon Ik-hwan, Ahn Byung-mu, and Lee Woo-jung. These leaders formed what Ko Ji-soo describes as a “Protestant intellectual network” capable of articulating and leading a coordinated response to the Yushin dictatorship.\n\nThe defining moment came after the proclamation of the Yushin Constitution in October 1972, which was perceived as a direct violation of democratic and biblical values. The regime adopted a two-faced religious policy—suppressing critical churches while rewarding compliant ones. The PROK was quickly targeted. On December 13, 1972, Rev. Eun Myung-ki of Jeonju Nammun Church was arrested during worship for allegedly violating martial law—a shocking moment, as it marked the first instance in modern Korean history where a pastor was arrested during a prayer service.\n\nThe PROK responded swiftly. On December 18, the General Assembly executive committee expressed deep regret that “a pastor praying from the pulpit was arrested while believers were forcibly dispersed.” The Jeonbuk Presbytery issued a public statement calling it “an assault not just on an individual, but on the entire church and on sacredness itself,” affirming that “actions for faith and social justice are biblical truth and divine calling”.\n\nAs Rev. Eun’s indictment revealed that he had opposed martial law and the Yushin reforms, the church recognized the event as politically motivated persecution. The incident became a rallying cry, clarifying that “today’s mission” must include resistance to unjust power, defense of religious conscience, and the right to political dissent. The church submitted petitions to the Blue House, Prime Minister, Justice Minister, and KCIA, declaring, “This kind of government action was unheard of even under Japanese colonial rule”.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1976, the PROK’s resistance took various forms: nationwide prayer meetings, public statements, petitions, and declarations of conscience. These activities were consistently nonviolent and theologically grounded. The denomination rejected both passive spirituality and violent confrontation, positioning itself as a community of active yet peaceful resistance.\n\nThe movement was deeply influenced by the PROK’s political theology of freedom. Rev. Lee Hae-young wrote that Christian freedom meant relativizing the state: “When political authority violates human dignity and freedom, it intrudes upon the realm of God… and becomes a demonic force”. Freedom, in this view, was not a civil privilege granted by the state but a theological imperative derived from the first commandment: “You shall have no other gods before me”—which meant, in this context, “Do not absolutize any person, power, system, or state”.\n\nUltimately, the PROK’s anti-Yushin movement reflected a mature synthesis of theology, organization, and social conscience. By embracing Missio Dei, freedom of conscience, and public witness, the denomination shaped one of the most consistent and theologically robust expressions of resistance in 1970s Korean Christianity. Its legacy is not only institutional but spiritual—demonstrating how faith communities can resist authoritarianism through both word and deed.\n\n\nTable 6.

This period was marked by:\n\nCoexistence and experimentation: Theological debates and political actions were shared within major denominations.\n\nUnfixed boundaries: Evangelicals occasionally engaged in social action, while Minjung theology was still in the process of being formalized.\n\nVolatile historical context: Rapid industrialization, urban poverty, the authoritarian Yushin regime, and global theological trends arrived simultaneously.\n\nMoments of cooperation and conflict: Progressives and conservatives jointly opposed certain public policies (e.g., U.S. troop withdrawal), while they also clashed bitterly over political theology, labor issues, and social justice.\n\n\n“This was a time when political engagement and withdrawal, the people and the gospel, injustice and obedience—two emerging streams—began recognizing each other and colliding.”\n\n\nFormation and Development of Progressive Protestantism\n\nCommitment to participatory faithProgressives responded to dictatorship and inequality by aligning Christian faith with social engagement.→ “The political participation of Christians must be viewed as an expression and practice of faith.”\n\nLeadership in the anti–Third Term Amendment movementRev. Kim Jae-jun's public opposition to Park Chung-hee’s constitutional changes marked a defining moment.→ “Resistance to injustice is a testimony to justice… to change a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ is the worst kind of hypocrisy.”\n\nMinistry to the urban poor and laborersRev. Park Hyung-kyu led organizing training among slum residents and laborers to foster rights-based communities.→ “Residents were trained to organize and raise consciousness, seeking ways to live with dignity.”\n\nStudent-led solidarity through disguised factory workChristian university students immersed themselves in working-class environments to build empathy.→ “They entered factories under disguise and lived among workers… to form bonds of solidarity.”\n\nTheological interpretation of Jeon Tae-il’s self-immolationProgressive Christians saw his death as parallel to Christ's crucifixion, giving rise to Minjung theology.→ “A church that ignores Jeon Tae-il’s death is one that ignores the death of Jesus on the cross.”\n\n\nFormation and Development of Conservative Protestantism\n\nDefense of church-state separationConservative leaders rejected political involvement as a distortion of the gospel’s message.→ “If Christians impose political views in Christ’s name, they degrade the gospel.”\n\nAlliance with the authoritarian regimeThey praised Park Chung-hee’s constitutional reform and emphasized obedience to leaders.→ “We must pray daily for the head of the nation and its leaders.”\n\nOpposition to progressive social ministriesConservative leaders viewed urban and labor ministries as overly politicized and spiritually misplaced.\n\nRejection of theological parallels between Jeon Tae-il and ChristMany reacted furiously to progressive interpretations of Jeon's death.→ “Do you think Jesus is that cheap?” was one of the responses, along with threats of violence.”\n\n\nConflict and Cooperation: The Essence of the Transitional Phase\n\nThe 1970s were not a time of total separation. In several instances, both camps found brief common ground.\n\nShared concerns over national identity, anti-communism, and moral decay allowed joint actions (e.g., Korea–Japan Treaty protest).\n\nHowever, interpretations of social justice and the gospel increasingly diverged, deepening theological and political rifts.\n\n\nTable 7.

The growth was not just numerical—it was deeply intertwined with this era’s tensions.\n\n\nPolitical and social instability increased spiritual demand\n\nIndustrial unrest, dictatorship, and urban poverty drove many Koreans to churches in search of solace and belonging.→ “The church functioned as an alternative community, a space of refuge and strength in a chaotic society.”\n\n\nConservative institutional growth and populist strategy\n\nConservative churches focused on mass evangelism through revivalism, prayer meetings, and programs tailored to urban migrants.\n\nMega-churches like Yoido Full Gospel Church surpassed 200,000 members by the late 1970s.→ “While doctrinally conservative, Cho Yong-gi’s church used highly modern systems to attract both working-class and middle-class Koreans.”\n\nAlliances with political powers helped secure space and resources, further fueling their expansion.\n\n\nMoral capital built by progressive leaders\n\nProgressives did not grow in numbers, but their actions—supporting democracy, justice, and the oppressed—enhanced the ethical image of Christianity.\n\n→ “Leaders like Kim Jae-jun, Park Hyung-kyu, and Moon Ik-hwan granted Protestantism moral authority in the democratization movement.”\n\n\nComplementary growth: Quantity and quality\n\nThe polarized theological streams created a dual-track growth system:\n\n| Dimension | Conservative | Progressive |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main focus | Institutional, quantitative growth | Ethical and ideological depth |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Strength | Evangelism, worship structure | Justice, human rights, intellectual discourse |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Result | Church expansion | Cultural and moral influence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n→ “Ironically, the very conflict between the two camps became a catalyst for Protestantism’s multifaceted rise.” \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\nCommon Bible Translation\n\n\nThe Common Bible Translation Project in 1970s Korea represents one of the most extraordinary moments of ecumenical collaboration in modern Christian history. It was not merely a technical exercise in textual translation; it was a theologically and politically charged attempt to build a shared linguistic and spiritual ground between Korean Catholics and Protestants. This monumental endeavor carried the aspirations of theological reconciliation, linguistic renewal, and national unity during a period of political unrest and spiritual ferment.\n\nEmerging in the wake of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and the ecumenical momentum initiated by the World Council of Churches, the Korean project gained institutional form through the establishment of the \"성서공동번역위원회\" (Common Bible Translation Committee) in 1968. This committee was a product of mutual openness: the Catholic Church ceased to label Protestant churches as heretical and began referring to them as \"형제 교회\" (brother churches), while Protestant denominations initiated their own efforts toward dialogue. Their shared vision culminated in the publication of the New Testament in 1971 and the complete Bible, including the Old Testament, in 1977.\n\nThis translation work was led by eminent figures from both traditions, including Fr. Seon Jong-wan on the Catholic side and Rev. Moon Ik-hwan from the Protestant side. Moon’s role was especially pivotal. An Old Testament scholar and Hebrew linguist educated at Princeton Theological Seminary, Moon brought both scholarly rigor and poetic sensitivity to the project. He viewed the translation as more than technical labor—it was a mission to restore beauty and clarity to the Korean Bible. He insisted, \"Shedding classical Chinese and Japanese syntax, and being liberated from Western rigid logic, nurturing the pure simplicity of Korean language—that’s the task of the Bible.\" His vision was to see the Bible not only as theology but as literature—capable of transforming worship, preaching, and national identity.\n\nFr. Seon Jong-wan, likewise, brought deep theological insight to the work, and introduced stylistically bold translations. He rejected the rigid rendering of Genesis 1:1—“태초에” (in the beginning)—and instead coined the neologism “비롯음에” (\"at the birthing\") to convey a more dynamic sense of divine creation rooted in Hebrew syntax. Similarly, he translated “빛이 있으라 하시니 빛이 있었더라” (Let there be light, and there was light) as “빛이 생기어라 하시매 빛이 생기니라” (Let light come into being, and it came into being), emphasizing the generative power of the Word. These translations reflected not just linguistic choices but deep theological commitments to a living, breathing God who moves in history.\n\nThese translation choices, however, sparked considerable controversy. One of the fiercest points of contention was the name of God. Catholic translators adhered to “하느님” (Haneunim), a form consistent with traditional Korean Catholic usage. Protestant communities, especially conservative denominations, rejected this in favor of “하나님” (Hananim), which they saw as doctrinally correct and rooted in their worship traditions. The final Common Bible employed “하느님,” which resulted in its rejection by many Protestant churches.\n\nAnother theological flashpoint was the rendering of the Hebrew tetragrammaton YHWH. Catholics introduced “야훼” (Yahweh), aligning closely with Hebrew scholarship. Protestants, however, were more familiar with the older “여호와” (Jehovah), a term inherited from Chinese Protestant Bibles. Once again, the Common Bible’s adoption of “야훼” created discomfort, as it departed from both liturgical and devotional norms among many Protestant communities.\n\nThe controversy extended into Christological and sacramental terminology. Protestants raised concerns that some phrasing in the translation favored Catholic theology—particularly on issues such as the Eucharist, Mary’s role in salvation history, and the nature of grace. Critics argued that the Common Bible leaned too close to Catholic positions on certain doctrinal issues, thus compromising what they saw as necessary theological clarity.\n\nIn terms of translation philosophy, Catholics leaned toward a dynamic equivalence model, seeking to reproduce meaning and affect rather than a word-for-word rendering. Protestants generally favored formal equivalence, seeking fidelity to the original syntax and structure. This difference in hermeneutical posture was vividly seen in how texts like Genesis 1:1 were handled. Moon Ik-hwan passionately believed that scripture should “liberate us from the clunky remnants of classical and colonial language, and bring us into living Korean.” This vision was not universally accepted and indeed was met with resistance from traditions that feared such literary freedom might weaken theological integrity.\n\nDespite—or perhaps because of—these tensions, the Common Bible stands as a unique testimony to what ecumenical cooperation can achieve and where its limits lie. Even its partial rejection speaks volumes about the identities it sought to reconcile. The project was simultaneously a theological union and a catalyst for confessional retrenchment. As one writer observed, “This was the Bible that tried to be both Catholic and Protestant—and in doing so became a symbol of both hope and hesitation.” To further illustrate how the Common Bible addressed these disputed terms, the following table compares key theological expressions and how they were resolved:\n\n\nTable 7. \n\n\n| Disputed Element | Catholic Position | Protestant Position | Final Common Bible Resolution |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| God's Name ('하느님' vs '하나님') | ‘하느님’ (Haneunim) reflects older Korean Catholic usage, emphasizing divine transcendence | ‘하나님’ (Hananim) aligns with Protestant tradition | Used ‘하느님’ throughout, causing some Protestant rejection |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| YHWH / Tetragrammaton | Preferred ‘야훼’ (Yahweh) to restore the original name of God from Hebrew | Preferred ‘여호와’ (Jehovah) as used historically | Adopted ‘야훼’, aligning with Hebrew scholarly conventions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Translation Style | Dynamic equivalence; poetic and natural Korean phrasing | More literal, word-for-word translation | Favored dynamic approach, led by Seon Jong-wan and Moon Ik-hwan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Christological Terms | Emphasized sacramental theology, sometimes including Eucharistic nuances | Preferred language reflecting sola fide theology | Carefully neutralized terms, avoiding overt doctrinal bias |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sacramental Expressions | Use of '성찬례' for Eucharist | Use of '성찬식' for Lord's Supper | Minimized sacramental terms; left to contextual interpretation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mary and Saints | Greater emphasis on Marian passages (Luke 1:28, etc.) | Reserved, non-venerational language | Adopted balanced renderings with literal Greek fidelity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nControversies in the Formation of Minjung Theology\n\n\nA major theological controversy during the formation of minjung theology was the divergence over how to interpret the essence of the Gospel proclamation. In traditional Christian theology, the central framework of the New Testament’s message is known as kerygma, a Greek word meaning “proclamation.” In biblical usage, kerygma refers to the public declaration of the core message of salvation—namely, that Jesus Christ died and rose again, and that those who believe in him will be saved. This concept, rooted in the apostolic preaching of Acts, frames salvation history through the lens of Christ's divine sonship and redemptive death and resurrection. However, minjung theologians strongly critiqued this emphasis on kerygma for abstracting Jesus from his historical context and detaching him from the lived experiences of the oppressed people.\n\nAhn Byung-mu argued that “the theologization of the kerygma transformed the murder of Jesus into a mere death, and replaced his political resistance with religious sacrifice”. For Ahn, the cross should not be understood as a mystical redemptive symbol, but as the result of Jesus’s solidarity with the oppressed and his resistance to unjust power. Thus, the Gospel is not only a message of spiritual salvation but a declaration that demands transformation in the midst of suffering and oppression. While not outright rejecting kerygma, minjung theology contended that “abstract proclamations alone are insufficient without the historical grounding of the people's reality”.\n\nThis approach sparked significant backlash within the Korean church. Conservative Protestant leaders accused minjung theology of “undermining doctrinal orthodoxy and politicizing the Gospel,” labeling it heretical. The controversy intensified when minjung theologians became involved in urban industrial mission work, which led to accusations of communist sympathies. Figures such as Ahn Byung-mu and Suh Nam-dong were even subject to disciplinary actions, including exclusion from theological faculties and threats of excommunication. These events demonstrate that minjung theology was not merely a theological discourse, but a profound confrontation with institutional religion, political authority, and the very meaning of faith.\n\nThe question of whether minjung theology prioritized political resistance over divine communion led to another persistent critique: the supposed absence of spirituality. Critics charged that minjung theology was overly preoccupied with structural injustice and lacked inner piety or mystical depth. In response, theologian Ryu Jang-hyun argued that minjung theology did not arise from monasteries but from “the bodily spirituality experienced in sites of suffering,” which he defined as a “spiritual encounter with God in the context of praxis”. He claimed, “the work of the Holy Spirit is always manifested through the event of the liberation of the minjung”—thus framing liberation not merely as a political event, but as a pneumatological act of salvation.\n\nEven within the movement, internal critiques emerged. One unresolved issue was the ambiguity of the term minjung itself. Who exactly qualifies as the minjung? Are intellectuals part of the minjung? These questions revealed a tension between theoretical constructs and lived realities. Some social theorists criticized the movement’s tendency to “abstract and objectify the people,” suggesting that minjung were often spoken about, but rarely empowered to speak for themselves.\n\nAnother major controversy emerged when Kim Chi-ha—once a central literary and intellectual figure in the minjung movement—shifted toward a life-centered cosmology in the 1980s. Influenced by Tonghak thought and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Kim proposed a cosmic spirituality that redefined minjung through an ecological and universal lens. This move was sharply criticized by progressives, some of whom accused him of “betraying the minjung cause.” Cultural critic Cho Jeong-hwan, however, argued that Kim's life philosophy was “not a withdrawal from history but a proposal for a new ethical paradigm”. While acknowledging\n\nKim’s contradictions, Cho asserted that his cosmic vision could still serve as “an alternative ethics of the universe that seeks to transcend materialist leftist paradigms”. These complex and often painful debates show that minjung theology emerged not only from theological speculation but from concrete historical experiences. It challenged theological, political, and cultural institutions, and in doing so, redefined the mission of theology as public, contextual, and embodied in the life of the people.\n\n\nPneumatological Conflicts and the Rise of the Yoido Full Gospel Church\n\n\nThe debates surrounding pneumatology and charismatic theology that unfolded across the 1970s and 1980s in South Korea were far more than theological disagreements or denominational distinctions. At the center of the storm stood Pastor David Yonggi Cho and the Yoido Full Gospel Church, whose Pentecostal pneumatology offered an experiential and empowering alternative to the traditional doctrines of mainline denominations. By presenting Spirit baptism as a post-conversion event and identifying glossolalia (speaking in tongues) as its clear, external sign, Cho’s theology stood in stark contrast to the Reformed traditions of Korean Presbyterianism, which understood Spirit baptism as synonymous with regeneration and denied the continuation of apostolic gifts such as healing and prophecy.\n\nAs one scholar notes, “Yonggi Cho’s conviction about a Spirit baptism that is distinct from conversion and evidenced by speaking in tongues starkly diverged from the pneumatology of existing denominations.” This theological divergence was not merely a matter of doctrine but was perceived by the theological establishment as a threat to the ecclesial identity and doctrinal orthodoxy of the Korean Protestant church. Figures like Dr. Hyung-Ryong Park of the Presbyterian General Assembly Seminary led the charge in journals such as Shinhak Jinan, critiquing Cho’s theology as unbiblical and misleading.\n\nThe widespread acceptance of Cho’s pneumatology, however, cannot be explained without reference to the socioeconomic upheavals of South Korea during this period. As rapid urbanization, industrialization, rural displacement, and political repression destabilized the social order, Cho’s message of Spirit-empowered healing, blessing, and personal transformation met the existential needs of the Korean people. The practice of speaking in tongues was not merely a doctrinal sign but a form of catharsis and spiritual empowerment for those living at the margins. “The practices of prayer mountain retreats, fasting, healing services, and exorcisms were deeply resonant with the religious sentiment of the Korean masses, and tongues functioned as a sacred language of grace.”\n\nThis theological and practical resonance resulted in explosive church growth. Within just a few decades, the Yoido Full Gospel Church became not only the largest church in Korea but also the largest church in the world. Testimonies of Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues flooded the pages of Shinangye (The Gospel World), a magazine closely associated with the movement. Stories like “I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues within five days” became a recurring feature. However, as criticism mounted, particularly in the 1970s, such testimonies gave way to more theological articles on the benefits and meaning of tongues by theologians like Park Jung-geun.\n\nIn response to criticism, Cho clarified that “speaking in tongues is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit itself... it is rather a powerful external sign of Spirit-filled experience, biblically confirmed.” Despite these clarifications, critics accused Cho’s theology of aligning too closely with shamanistic mysticism and prosperity theology. In 1983, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (Tonghap) launched an official investigation into the beliefs and theology of Yonggi Cho and the Yoido Full Gospel Church, questioning his emphasis on tongues, healing, and spiritual experiences.\n\nDespite criticisms, Cho’s pneumatology proved effective in addressing the psychological and social needs of South Koreans during a time of massive upheaval. The theology of Spirit baptism, charismatic gifts, and divine blessing did not merely promise eschatological salvation but offered tangible transformation in the here and now. His ability to ritualize these experiences in structured church life—through home cell groups, healing services, and prayer mountains—enabled the church to function as both spiritual sanctuary and psychosocial support network. In this sense, “Pentecostalism functioned as practical religion and psychosocial support.”\n\n\nTable 8.

This issue was not merely about ecclesiastical policy but about biblical interpretation, theological identity, and how the Korean church would engage with both its Reformed tradition and the global Christian community. The contrasting responses of Tonghap and Hapdong—two major branches of Korean Presbyterianism formed after the 1959 schism—offered a vivid picture of the growing divergence between progressive and conservative currents within Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nTonghap and Hapdong: Distinct Ecclesial Orientations\n\nTo fully understand their differing positions on women’s ordination, it is crucial to examine the broader theological and institutional orientations of the Tonghap and Hapdong denominations. While both emerged from a shared Presbyterian heritage and adhere to the Westminster Confession of Faith, their trajectories since division have diverged dramatically.\n\n\nTonghap: Ecumenical, Theologically Progressive, and Globally Engaged\n\nTonghap (The Presbyterian Church of Korea) represents the more ecumenical and theologically progressive wing of Korean Presbyterianism. Actively engaged in the World Council of Churches (WCC), Tonghap aligns itself with mainline Protestant denominations worldwide and has shown receptiveness to contemporary theological currents such as contextual theology, gender equality, and social justice.\n\n\nTonghap emphasizes:\n\nParticipation in global Christian networks and cooperation with denominations such as the PCUSA and GKN.\n\nFlexibility in biblical interpretation, including openness to historical-critical methods.\n\nLay leadership, inclusive ministry models, and theological reflection that engages cultural change.\n\nIn this environment, the ordination of women was framed not only as a theological decision but as an issue of mission, justice, and ecclesial credibility in the modern world.\n\nHapdong: Confessionalist, Doctrinally Conservative, and Biblically Literalist\n\nBy contrast, Hapdong (The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) stands as the confessionally conservative and doctrinally rigid branch. It affirms biblical inerrancy, maintains a literal reading of Scripture, and adheres to the regulative principle of worship. Hapdong has been deeply critical of the WCC and other ecumenical organizations, which it views as compromising Reformed orthodoxy.\n\nHapdong’s identity is marked by:\n\nStrict observance of the Westminster standards in unaltered form.\n\nDeep concern for maintaining the gendered hierarchy established in Scripture.\n\nCentralized theological authority and a legacy shaped by theologians such as Park Hyung-Ryong and Seo Chul-Won.\n\nIn this context, the ordination of women was viewed not as a theological innovation but as a threat to the very foundations of church order and biblical authority.\n\n\nHapdong: Confessionalist, Doctrinally Conservative, and Biblically Literalist\n\nBy contrast, Hapdong (The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) stands as the confessionally conservative and doctrinally rigid branch.

Although motions to adopt women elders were repeatedly defeated, the increasing number of affirmative votes revealed a gradual change in denominational sentiment.\n\nKey General Assembly Trends:\n\n58th General Assembly (1973): Motion rejected (95 in favor, 162 opposed).\n\n59th Assembly (1974): Rejected (120:183).\n\n60th Assembly (1975): Rejected (126:180).\n\n61st Assembly (1976): Rejected (133:173).\n\n62nd Assembly (1977): Narrowly rejected (143:157).\n\nThe consistent increase in support indicated a theological and generational shift underway within the denomination\n\nCore Arguments in the Motions:\n\n“Over two-thirds of the church membership consists of women. Their inclusion in ordained ministry is essential for mission effectiveness.”\n\n“Women’s ordination reflects the current global trend of gender equality. The church cannot be seen as ignoring women’s rights.”\n\n“As global partner churches allow women’s ordination, our women are disadvantaged in international ecumenical relations.”\n\nThese arguments were largely contextual and missional, grounded in concerns over justice, parity, and the church’s public witness.\n\n\nHapdong: Rejection Rooted in Scripture and Ecclesial Tradition\n\nHapdong, meanwhile, never formally entertained motions for women’s ordination. Instead, theological treatises and institutional publications served as the primary mode of opposition. By the mid-1990s, the denomination had consolidated its position through articles in Shinhak Jinam (1996, 1997) and the 83rd General Assembly (1998), which officially reaffirmed the prohibition[5†source].\n\nScriptural Grounds for Opposition:\n\n1 Timothy 2:11–15 – “Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.” Interpreted as forbidding women from teaching or exercising authority in the church.\n\n1 Corinthians 11:2–10 – The headship order of creation.\n\n1 Corinthians 14:34–35 – “Women should remain silent in the churches.”\n\n1 Timothy 3:1–7 / Titus 1:5–6 – Qualifications for elders described in male-exclusive terms.\n\nPark Hyung-Ryong maintained:\n\n“The legal authority to teach and rule the entire church belongs exclusively to men; this is the clear meaning of Scripture and the long-held conviction of the universal church.”\n\nWayne Grudem added:\n\n“The New Testament only records the ordination of men, which reflects the divine principle that public church office is given to males alone.”\n\nThis complementarian theology stood at the core of Hapdong's ecclesial structure and identity.\n\n\nTable 9.

It uncovers fundamentally divergent theological ecosystems: Tonghap's global, contextual, and mission-driven orientation versus Hapdong’s confessionalist, biblicist, and ecclesially protective posture. For Tonghap, the issue evolved from inclusion to transformation. For Hapdong, it was always about preservation—of Scripture, order, and tradition. In the end, women’s ordination became a litmus test for each denomination’s identity: a marker of their theological vision, cultural openness, and interpretive method. These tensions, born in the 1970s, continue to define the contours of Korean Presbyterianism to this day.\n\n\nIndigenization Theology and Theological Conflict\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a transitional era in Korean theology, as indigenization theology shifted from theological experimentation to a theology rooted in social engagement. During this period, Korean theologians moved beyond merely adapting the gospel to Korean culture and began reconstructing theology within the lived realities of the Korean people and their history. In this process, fierce theological debates unfolded over how to redefine the relationships among gospel, church, and culture.\n\nThis theological transformation was grounded in concerns raised in the 1960s. In 1959, Yoo Dong-sik published the article “Tao and Logos”, where he asserted that “the gospel must be transmitted through culture and language, and must be reinterpreted through Korean philosophical consciousness”. Similarly, Yoon Sung-bum explored how Christian truth could take root within the spiritual and philosophical frameworks of the Korean people.\n\nWhile these early efforts remained limited to individual scholarly attempts, the 1970s witnessed their expansion into a broader theological movement. The progressive camp—represented by NCCK, KSCF, and Hanshin University—advocated for a theology that resonated with the lived experiences and emotional sensibilities of the Korean people. Theologians such as Suh Nam-dong, Ahn Byung-mu, and Kim Yong-bok argued that indigenization theology must not merely localize the gospel but must incorporate the historical suffering and liberation of the Korean minjung (masses) as its core. Kim Yong-bok defined this as “a theology lived out with the minjung,” emphasizing that “the gospel must be expressed anew through the language and emotions of the people”.\n\nIn contrast, conservative theologians emphasized the transculturality of the Bible, warning that indigenization efforts could undermine the essential nature of Christianity. They maintained that the gospel represents a universally valid truth that transcends all cultures and historical contexts. Consequently, any attempt to integrate elements from Korean traditional religions or indigenous symbols was viewed as a potential threat of syncretism.\n\nThe debates were not confined to abstract theory but were reflected in liturgical practice and theological education. Some seminaries—including Seoul Presbyterian Seminary, Methodist Theological Seminary, and Hanshin University—experimented with Koreanized worship services, incorporating traditional elements such as hanbok attire, pansori preaching, folk hymnody, and even symbolic figures like Dangun or shamanistic imagery. These experiments sparked controversy, with some denominational authorities denouncing them as heretical acts.\n\nMeanwhile, institutional and academic support for indigenization theology was expanding rapidly. The establishment of the Christian Institute for the Study of Korean Culture in 1973 and the Korea Theological Study Institute in 1977 provided structural and scholarly foundations for the movement. Kim Yong-bok’s book The Minjung and Indigenization Theology (1980) articulated the movement’s central direction. He declared, “Indigenization theology is not about surrendering to tradition, but about revitalizing the gospel,” and insisted that theology grounded in solidarity with the minjung represented the authentic path for Korean Christianity.\n\nThis momentum in the 1970s paved the way for further developments in the 1980s, where indigenization theology evolved into a fully institutionalized and practice-oriented minjung theology. Ahn Byung-mu defined minjung theology as “a theology where the Korean church encounters the minjung, based on the recognition that Jesus himself was part of the minjung,” asserting that gospel indigenization must begin from the concrete realities of the oppressed. During the 1980s, indigenization was no longer about translating Christian concepts into Korean symbols, but rather became a theology of liberation addressing the structures of political oppression and economic injustice.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1970s served as a theological bridge between the philosophical inquiries of the 1960s and the praxis-based theology of the 1980s. It was a pivotal decade in which nationalism, faith, liberation, and gospel converged in complex ways. In the broader arc of Korean theological history, the movement for indigenization expanded far beyond questions of “Koreanization” to encompass a full-scale reinterpretation and rearticulation of the Christian gospel within its Korean context.\n\n\nRevisiting the Korean Christian Federation’s Alleged Application to the World Council of Churches: Myth, Miscommunication, and Cold War Echoes in South Korean Protestantism\n\n\nThe issue of the Korean Christian Federation's (KCF) application for membership in the World Council of Churches (WCC) is a symbolic episode that reveals how religious exchanges can acquire political overtones in the Cold War context between North and South Korea. The reality of the event and the reaction of the South Korean Christian community unfolded amid longstanding distortions and misunderstandings, the truth of which has only recently come to light through scholarly inquiry.\n\nThe incident began in February 1974 when two diplomats from the North Korean mission in Geneva visited the WCC headquarters and delivered two letters under the name of the KCF. These letters, rather than expressing a desire to join the WCC, called for the Council’s support of the South Korean church’s pro-democracy movement and condemned the human rights abuses of the Park Chung-hee regime. In particular, the letter stated, \"We hope you will deeply understand our letter and raise your voice against the fascist atrocities committed by the South Korean authorities, and just as you supported our people's struggle for national reunification in the past, we hope you will actively support the righteous struggle of the people, including South Korean religious believers\"—demonstrating that the letter was far more political than religious in nature.\n\nAt the time, this letter was widely misinterpreted as a formal application for WCC membership. Two factors contributed to this misunderstanding. First, one of the North Korean diplomats reportedly said, \"I am not a Christian, but I want to join the WCC,\" requesting information about the organization. Second, South Korean church leaders—such as Rev. Yoo Ho-joon of the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) and Rev. Kim Kwan-seok, General Secretary of the National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC)—relayed this information imprecisely to domestic religious and media circles. Rev. Kim Kwan-seok even held a press conference upon his return, claiming, \"The North fabricated a Christian organization called the Korean Christian Federation that doesn't even exist and tried to apply for WCC membership, but was rejected\". This statement stoked strong opposition within the South Korean Christian community and quickly established the WCC application claim as a fact.\n\nHowever, subsequent archival research by Professor Kim Heung-soo of Mokwon University has clearly shown otherwise. After meticulously examining the WCC archives, he concluded, “It was not a membership application, but a letter requesting WCC support for the pro-democracy movement in South Korea.” Kim noted that he searched the WCC’s underground vaults for this so-called application form but never found it. Instead, the evidence indicated that the North Korean diplomats had simply taken documents like the WCC’s charter, lists of member churches and publications—materials more indicative of information gathering than of any formal application. In short, there was no written application, and the oral comment was grossly exaggerated and miscommunicated as a full-fledged attempt at WCC membership.\n\nThis misunderstanding sparked significant controversy within the South Korean Christian community. The WCC had already been regarded with suspicion by certain conservative Protestant groups in Korea, who viewed it as a pro-communist organization. This perception stemmed from events during the Korean War, when the WCC supported a ceasefire, earning the ire of then-President Syngman Rhee and fueling conspiracy theories promoted by right-wing Christian circles aligned with the American ICCC (International Council of Christian Churches). The claim that the WCC had accepted a membership bid from North Korea further intensified this animosity, and the misbelief persisted well into the 1990s.\n\nEventually, the truth was clarified through academic research: there was no actual application. Instead, the KCF's contact with the WCC was politically motivated, aimed at denouncing South Korea's dictatorship, and was misrepresented due to the tense atmosphere of the Cold War and ideological divides. Professor Kim summarized the matter unequivocally: \"The claim that the KCF applied for WCC membership is historically false.\"*⁷\n\nThis episode carries dual significance for the South Korean church. First, it serves as a case study of how truth can be distorted and weaponized when religious and political interpretations collide. Second, it highlights how misunderstandings about the WCC have hindered South Korea's engagement in global ecumenical movements. As Professor Kim stated, *“The Cold War mentality and narrow theology of the Korean church have produced a distorted view of the WCC.” His findings underscore the need for a more reflective and informed approach to religious diplomacy and church history. \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nThe Korean Christian Federation and the Dual Structure of Christianity in North Korea\n\n\nThe reemergence of organized Protestant structures in 1970s North Korea was not a mere act of religious tolerance but a calculated maneuver by the regime to integrate religion within the ideological and institutional bounds of the socialist state. Central to this effort was the revitalization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1974 under the name “Central Committee of the Korean Christian Federation,” which served both as a surrogate ecclesiastical body and a political organ aligned with Juche-based governance.\n\nThe 1972 Socialist Constitution, while formally recognizing “freedom of religion,” encoded this freedom within a framework of Juche hegemony. Article 54 granted the right to believe or not to believe in religion, but only insofar as it did not “disturb the order of society.” In this context, the KCF became the regime’s sanctioned vehicle for religious expression, structured not to promote theological autonomy but to project an image of religious coexistence within a socialist order.\n\nDuring the 1970s and into the 1980s, the KCF underwent structural reorganization. By 1985, it had expanded its regional presence to 50 branch offices, up from 35 in 1981. Official statistics indicated there were about 12,000 to 14,000 Christians and approximately 20 ordained pastors, as well as 520 house churches—framed as legitimate worship spaces, yet under tight surveillance and regulation by the state. These house churches functioned irregularly and were often led not by ordained clergy but by laypersons trained or guided by the KCF.\n\nNew showpiece churches, most notably Bongsu Church (1988) and Chilgol Church (1989), were constructed in Pyongyang. These institutions were showcased to foreign visitors as evidence of religious tolerance. However, as Jooseop Keum notes, “the KCF was not merely a propaganda tool, but an apparatus of religious redefinition under Juche ideology, modeling a form of minjung-centered ecclesiology that reflected socialist ethics.” This “socialist Christianity” emphasized national unity, anti-imperialism, and social harmony over spiritual salvation or scriptural orthodoxy.\n\nDespite the presence of officially recognized churches, a parallel and clandestine network of underground Christian communities persisted. These believers rejected the regime’s tightly controlled religious institutions and instead maintained faith through secret worship—gathering in basements, mountains, abandoned mines, or family homes. Though state sources acknowledged 520 house churches, missionary groups and defectors estimated there were between 100 and 2,000 underground churches by the late 1980s, with up to 30,000 adherents. Religious activity beyond the bounds of the KCF was viewed as subversive. The North Korean Human Rights White Paper documented numerous cases of imprisonment, torture, and execution for faith-related activities. Reports suggest that between 15,000 and 200,000 individuals were incarcerated in political prison camps during this period for religious reasons.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s thus witnessed the consolidation of a dual structure of Christianity in North Korea: a state-managed, ideologically useful religious system designed for propaganda and diplomacy, and a resilient underground church grounded in genuine spiritual devotion. One was publicly visible; the other lived in shadow—sustained by whispered prayers, generational memory, and enduring resistance. As Seong Lim Noh observes, “in order to secure international legitimacy, the DPRK reformulated Protestantism as compatible with socialism, reinterpreting its ethical values—such as compassion and justice—as coinciding with socialist morality.”[6] \n\n## Bibliography\n\nKoh, Ji-Soo.
