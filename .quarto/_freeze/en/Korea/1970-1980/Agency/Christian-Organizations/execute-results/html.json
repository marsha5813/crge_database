Led by Rev. Joon Gon Kim, CCC went beyond being a mere campus ministry to become the strategic command center of the national evangelization movement, implementing a theology and practice that fused evangelical faith with nationalistic aspirations. Amid political polarization and denominational divisions, CCC promoted unity through evangelism and simultaneously engaged with social and public concerns, leaving a deep impact both within the church and in broader society.\n\nThe emergence of CCC occurred against the backdrop of late-1960s turmoil in Korea—political instability, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the Yushin Constitution, and church division over WCC membership. In this climate, Rev. Joon Gon Kim proclaimed, “Only the gospel can save the nation,” and envisioned evangelization as the pathway to national renewal.\n\nIn 1965, the National Evangelization Movement was launched by prominent Christian leaders such as Kim Hwal-lan, Han Kyung-chik, and Kim Joon Gon, under the slogan “Thirty Million to Christ.” This campaign became the first nationwide strategy for organized, cross-sectoral evangelism targeting urban centers, villages, students, the military, children, and overseas Koreans. CCC played a key role by managing leadership training, developing evangelistic materials, and coordinating local rallies. It was “an ecumenical evangelistic movement that transcended theological divisions,” forging rare unity among conservative and progressive Protestants.\n\nIn 1972, CCC launched the Holy City Movement to evangelize Korea’s cities, which culminated in EXPLO ’74, the largest evangelistic rally in Korean history, held at Yeouido Plaza with over 1.5 million attendees. This event showcased CCC Korea’s unparalleled organizational capacity and passion for national evangelization to the global church. It was not merely a revival meeting, but the culmination of CCC’s discipleship training systems, local church partnerships, and mass-media-based evangelism strategies.\n\nCCC’s efforts within the church professionalized evangelism and discipleship. Many local churches adopted CCC’s training models or participated in joint events that helped them grow. After the Holy City Movement, CCC envisioned a church presence in every gospel-saturated city and developed “strategic partnerships” with churches to that end. Many churches even appointed CCC-trained student leaders to leadership roles. However, CCC’s use of anti-communist language and association with national development ideologies also created friction with progressive Protestant sectors.\n\nIn the 1970s, CCC was not merely a gospel-proclaiming body but functioned as a “national evangelical movement” that articulated theological critiques of society through a mission-centered lens. Rev. Joon Gon Kim proclaimed, “Democratization without evangelization is a mere façade, and nationalism without God is a hollow illusion,” firmly rejecting political reform without spiritual transformation. CCC laid the groundwork for Korean evangelical nationalism that would shape the theology and praxis of churches in the 1980s, linking gospel, nation, and youth into a single narrative of Christian identity.\n\n\nTable 1.

Under the authoritarian rule of President Park Chung Hee, South Korea experienced rapid state-led economic growth, but beneath the surface lay widespread labor exploitation, growing socioeconomic inequality, and political repression. In response, KSCF rejected a narrow, evangelistic focus and took the lead in embodying the social responsibility of faith, driven by young people’s yearning to “establish God’s justice on earth.”\n\nFormed in 1969 through the unification of the university division of the Korea Student Christian Council (KSCC) and the university YMCA, KSCF was rooted in ecumenical theology and the global Christian youth movement. Influenced by the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Student Christian Movement (SCM), KSCF embraced the idea of a “responsible society” and sought to respond faithfully to the injustices embedded in the social structure. A pivotal turning point came on November 13, 1970, when a young garment worker, Jeon Tae-il, self-immolated in protest against harsh labor conditions in the Peace Market. His death shocked Korean society and compelled Christian students to re-examine how the gospel could be lived out in the real world.\n\nKSCF immediately responded theologically and communally to Jeon’s death. During a public theology lecture series organized by the Yonsei University Divinity School, KSCF Secretary General Oh Jae-sik discarded his prepared remarks to share news of Jeon’s death and interpreted it as a sacrifice akin to Christ’s crucifixion. In the December 1970 issue of Christian Thought, he published an essay titled “A Certain Jesus’ Death,” asserting that “Jeon’s death was the crucifixion of Jesus in our time”. His statement provoked intense backlash from conservative Protestant circles, and Oh reportedly faced physical threats as a result. KSCF’s response did not stop at theological interpretation but extended to tangible actions. Shortly after Jeon’s death, KSCF co-organized an interdenominational memorial service at Yeondong Church with Pax Romana (the Catholic university student association), the Urban Industrial Mission Practitioners’ Council, and the Catholic Workers’ Youth Movement (JOC). At the service, a “Confession of Commitment” was read, repenting for societal sins that led to Jeon’s death and calling Christians to solidarity with workers. At Saemunan Church, university students held a fasting prayer vigil, and students from the Methodist and Presbyterian seminaries issued public statements, affirming that true Christian faith must stand with the suffering.\n\nIn tandem with these actions, KSCF intensified its Student Community Development Corps (Haksa-dan), a program launched in 1969. Based on the community organizing theories of Saul Alinsky in the United States, this program mobilized small groups of Christian students to live and work alongside marginalized communities—including factory workers, slum residents, and rural laborers—embodying a form of social discipleship rooted in practical faith. Jeon Tae-il’s death further galvanized the program, as students increasingly viewed solidarity with the oppressed as an essential expression of their faith. These efforts positioned KSCF as a key actor in laying the theological and social foundations for South Korea’s democratization movement in the 1970s. Rather than merely advocating progressive theology, KSCF implemented a praxis of prayer, solidarity, and structural transformation. Theologian Kim Myung-bae noted that “KSCF was the community that most radically socialized faith, serving as a bridge between the democratization movement and the church”. These efforts contributed to later movements such as the Urban Industrial Mission and Minjung theology, as well as to the broader pro-democracy movement of the 1980s.\n\nMore importantly, KSCF demonstrated that faith and democracy, gospel and justice, were not mutually exclusive. Its members pursued a life of witness rooted in the conviction that “the justice of God’s Kingdom is found among the poor and the suffering.” This path often led to hardship and rejection, but it also revealed a prophetic possibility for church reform and hope for Christian engagement in society. KSCF’s religious praxis thus forged a vital bridge between the democratization movement and the Korean church. In the face of state violence and church silence under the Yushin regime, Christian students reinterpreted faith as a public vocation and embraced justice for the marginalized as a core gospel imperative. They argued that the church must go beyond worship halls to walk alongside the suffering in workplaces, back alleys, and rural villages. KSCF did not engage in abstract ideology but lived out its theology in acts of solidarity, showing that the church could stand on the side of justice rather than complacency. In doing so, KSCF helped shape the moral language of Korean democracy and embodied the possibility that the church could become an agent of social transformation.\n\n\nTable 2.  Comparison of KSCC, KSCF, and Korea CCC in the 1970s\n\n\n| Category | KSCC(Korea Student Christian Council) | KSCF(Korea Student Christian Federation) | Korea CCC(Campus Crusade for Christ) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Founding Background | Emerging from YMCA student movements in the 1920s; affiliated with the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF) | Founded in 1969 by merging the university division of KSCC and the university YMCA | Established in 1958 as a branch of the American CCC, focused on campus evangelism |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Theological Orientation | Ecumenical, liberal theology, social engagement | Ecumenical, socially engaged with integrated evangelical action | Evangelical, Bible-centered, theologically conservative |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Movement Character | Student-centered faith and social justice activism | Social embodiment of faith, focus on democratization and field practice | Emphasis on individual salvation, evangelism, and discipleship training |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Key Activity Period | 1950s–1960s, peak of student Christian activism | 1970s, especially active after the Jeon Tae-il incident | 1960s–1980s, rapid expansion in campus evangelism |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Representative Activities | Bible study, prayer meetings, statements on human rights and peace | Student Community Development Corps (Haksa-dan), labor solidarity, public protest | Evangelistic rallies, discipleship programs, spiritual revival events |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Organizational Structure | Connected to SCM globally, focused on student autonomy | Inherited WSCF legacy, integrated national student network | Centralized structure tied to CCC International |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Key Figures | Yang Il-dong, Kim Jae-jun, Park Hyung-kyu | Oh Jae-sik, Yang Guk-joo, figures linked to seminaries and urban industrial missions | Kim Jun-gon, Jo Dong-jin, leading figures of evangelical Christianity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Response to Jeon Tae-il Incident | No official response (decline phase) | Held memorial services, fasting prayers, issued confession statements and social declarations | Minimal response, emphasized national evangelization and anti-communism |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Relationship with State Power | Aligned with democratization efforts | Critical of authoritarian regime, prophetic engagement | Cooperative with regime, emphasized harmony between church and nation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThis table highlights their theological orientations, historical backgrounds, organizational characteristics, and political engagements. While KSCC represents the earlier ecumenical and social engagement-oriented student movement, KSCF emerged as a renewal and expansion of this tradition with a stronger emphasis on field-based social practice and democratization. In contrast, Korea CCC followed a distinctly evangelical path with an emphasis on personal salvation and cooperation with state-led modernization.\n\n\nNational Council of Churches in Korea\n\n\nIn the politically repressive atmosphere of 1970s South Korea, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) emerged as the primary ecumenical voice resisting the Park Chung Hee regime. Theologically rooted in the Missio Dei framework, the NCCK emphasized that God's mission included not only spiritual salvation but also justice, peace, and liberation from structural sin. This theological commitment led to a series of public declarations which had both theological depth and political urgency.\n\nThe 1973 \"Declaration of Korean Christians\" was a pivotal moment in Korean Protestant resistance. While anonymous due to the threat of government retaliation, the declaration prophetically denounced the Yushin regime, declaring, \"What moves us today is not the expectation of victory, but a confession of guilt before God.\" This statement framed resistance as a spiritual imperative and denounced the October Yushin (1972) as a betrayal of both the nation and Christian conscience.\n\nFollowing this, the 1974 \"Theological Declaration of Korean Christians\" articulated a more developed theological rationale for church participation in social liberation. It emphasized that salvation must be understood holistically, addressing not only individual sin but also systemic injustice. This declaration explicitly challenged the church to stand with the marginalized and to reject complicity with oppressive structures.\n\nThe NCCK's actions were situated within a broader context of Christian nationalism and revivalist fervor. Movements such as the Minjok Bogeumhwa (National Evangelization Movement), spearheaded by figures like Kim Joon Gon, aimed to use Christian revivalism as a means of national renewal. Mass rallies like Billy Graham's 1973 crusade and Explo '74 were held in state-managed spaces like Yeouido Plaza with government approval, revealing a strategic alliance between revivalist Protestantism and the anti-communist state apparatus.\n\nWhile the NCCK maintained a prophetic critique of state power, other segments of the Protestant church engaged in the national evangelization project as a means to bolster a sense of Christian nationalism. The theological framing of Minjok (ethnic nation) as an object of salvation and the strategic deployment of mass revival events functioned to blur the line between nationalism and evangelism. Kim Joon Gon famously declared on January 1, 1971: \"There is no faster and better way to the reunification of the two Koreas and the well-being of the nation than the mobilization of two million Christians to achieve a national revolution through evangelism.\"\n\nIn contrast, the NCCK’s 1973 and 1974 declarations emphasized solidarity with the oppressed and theological critique of militarized power. These statements laid the groundwork for Minjung Theology, which interpreted the gospel through the suffering and agency of the oppressed Korean masses. The emphasis on God's preferential option for the poor represented a significant departure from the state-aligned nationalism of revivalist evangelicals.\n\nThus, the 1970s witnessed a theological divergence within Korean Protestantism. On one side stood the NCCK, articulating a liberationist vision rooted in justice and solidarity; on the other, a state-aligned revivalist movement that sacralized nation-building and anti-communism as spiritual mandates.\n\n\nSummary of the Declaration of Korean Christians (1973)\n\nWe, as Korean Christians, issue this declaration in response to the oppressive political climate following the Yushin Constitution of October 17, 1972. Recognizing the risks involved, we choose to remain anonymous.\n\nConfession of Faith: We believe that Christians are called by God to stand with the oppressed, proclaim the truth, and participate in social and political reform.\n\nCritique of the Regime: We denounce the authoritarian rule, suppression of conscience and religious freedom, media manipulation, political persecution, and economic injustice perpetrated by the current government.\n\nCall to Action: We urge the rejection of laws and policies that disregard the sovereignty of the people and call for national solidarity to restore democracy.\n\nAppeal for Global Solidarity: We request prayers and support from the global Christian community, emphasizing our shared commitment to justice and peace.\n\n\nSummary of the Theological Declaration of Korean Christians (1974)\n\nOn November 18, 1974, sixty-six theologians and pastors issued this declaration, articulating the church's theological stance and social responsibility:\n\nHolistic Understanding of Salvation: Salvation encompasses not only the forgiveness of individual sins but also liberation from oppressive social structures.\n\nRole of the Church: The church must stand in solidarity with the oppressed and lead efforts to realize justice and peace.\n\nCritique of Government: We denounce the unjust intervention of state power and the human rights violations resulting from flawed economic structures.\n\nTheological Foundation: We affirm that through the work of the Holy Spirit, we are called to participate in creating a new society and history.\n\n\nKorean Christian Professors Association (KCPA)\n\n\nIn the turbulent political landscape of 1970s South Korea, the Korean Christian Professors Association (KCPA) emerged not merely as a gathering of Protestant intellectuals but as a theological vanguard actively responding to authoritarianism and social injustice. The KCPA, founded in 1966 in the spirit of the ecumenical movement, quickly became a crucible for theological engagement with Korea’s socio-political realities. Its members, many of whom were influenced by global ecumenical trends and theologies of liberation, particularly WCC’s theology of humanization, laid the groundwork for what would later become Minjung theology. This intellectual and theological ferment gave rise to a faith practice that was not only doctrinal but also deeply political.\n\nThe theological commitment of the KCPA centered on a vision of human liberation grounded in the Gospel. As Koh Ji Soo notes, the movement’s core was an “attempt to theologically reconstitute the people alienated in the process of industrialization as subjects of labor and production” through the concept of Minjung theology, which he categorizes as a “discourse of theological humanization.” This humanization was not abstract but deeply embodied in Korea’s historical context, where the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee enacted sweeping economic reforms that deepened inequalities and provoked democratic resistance. In such a setting, theology, for the members of KCPA, became a means to interpret and transform the world.\n\nThe association’s influence was not confined to academic circles. As the Yushin Constitution was enacted in 1972 and the government enforced a series of Emergency Measures, many KCPA-affiliated professors were forcibly dismissed from their posts. These “dismissed intellectuals” would later form the core of the “Association of Dismissed Professors,” which actively collaborated with Christian student and youth movements, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), and urban-industrial missions. This realignment gave rise to a more engaged form of Christian activism rooted in theological conviction. As Jeong Byeongjun observes, the KCPA became “an intellectual body that contributed to Korea’s democratization movement and Christian social movement by offering theological and ideological resources.”\n\nAt the heart of the KCPA’s theological reorientation was the work of theologian Seo Nam-dong, whose writings powerfully articulated the vision of Minjung as the historic and salvific subject of Korea. Seo did not view the Minjung simply as pitiable victims, but as the true agents of divine history. “The Minjung,” he insisted, “must be recognized as the most significant historical subject in the redemptive work of God, and the Bible must be read anew in the language of the Minjung.” Seo’s interpretation called for a radical redefinition of the church’s role—not as a custodian of tradition, but as a suffering companion of the oppressed.\n\nSuch theological redefinitions found resonance in major events of the 1970s. The 1973 “Korean Christian Declaration” (한국기독교인 선언) and the subsequent 1974 “Theological Declaration of Korean Christians” (한국그리스도인의 신학적 성명) were landmarks in Christian political witness. Composed largely by KCPA-affiliated theologians such as Kim Yong-bok, Kim Kwan-seok, and Seo Nam-dong, these declarations accused the Yushin regime of “betraying the people,” asserting that Christian participation in democratic resistance was “a command of God, a demand of the people, and a historic tradition of the church.” These documents served to theologically legitimize Christian engagement in Korea’s democratization process, and were clandestinely printed and distributed with the blessing of NCCK’s general secretary.\n\nThe integration of theology and political engagement reached a critical juncture with the Mincheonghakryeon (Democratic Youth and Student Federation) incident in 1974. Following a fabricated conspiracy by the state, over 1,000 students were interrogated and more than 200 arrested, including 26 core members of the KSCF (Korean Student Christian Federation). Christian professors, including many from the KCPA, not only supported the students spiritually and materially, but also played a public role in defending their human rights. As the repression intensified, “the NCCK Human Rights Committee became a cradle of ecumenical human rights activism, allowing the church to transcend denominational barriers and stand with the persecuted.”\n\nDespite the regime’s persistent efforts to suppress dissent, KCPA and its partners in the ecumenical movement received significant international solidarity. Organizations such as the WCC, the CCA (Christian Conference of Asia), and various German and Japanese churches provided spiritual, financial, and material support to the Korean Christian resistance. The role of these ecumenical alliances was critical, as “without the international funds and networks, the Korean ecumenical movement in the 1970s and 80s could not have survived.” These transnational connections allowed Korean Christian intellectuals to frame their struggle not merely as a national issue but as part of a global fight for justice.\n\nUltimately, the KCPA’s theological-political praxis represents a unique moment in Korean church history when theology became praxis, and intellectual discourse translated into prophetic action. Theirs was a radical fidelity—to the Gospel, to the people, and to justice in history. Through the work of theologians like Seo Nam-dong and their collaboration with student, labor, and ecumenical groups, the KCPA helped redefine Korean Christianity in a moment of national crisis. They showed that theology could be, and must be, lived in the streets, prisons, and classrooms of a nation under dictatorship.\n\n\nKorean Church Women United (KCWU)\n\n\nThe Korean Church Women United (KCWU) emerged in the 1970s as a prophetic ecumenical force that amplified the silenced voices of women marginalized by the developmentalist ideology of the Park Chung-hee regime.\n\nTheir activities directly confronted the violence and exploitation hidden beneath South Korea’s “modernization of the fatherland” narrative, particularly the commodification of women through state-led sex tourism and the systemic neglect of Korean women affected by the atomic bomb. Lim Hee-sook characterizes this movement as a theological awakening in which women realized that “they, among all people, were the most oppressed under the structure of division” and responded with collective action grounded in faith.\n\nA defining moment came in December 1973, when KCWU hosted a seminar titled “The Problem of Tourists and Prostituted Women”, addressing the rise of sex tourism marketed to Japanese men. The organization released a public statement condemning the state’s complicity: “The economic-first development policy is not only making our nation a virtual colony of Japan but also commodifying Korean women under the guise of tourism promotion.” This act transformed a stigmatized issue into a systemic critique of patriarchal capitalism and marked one of the first public theological denunciations of the Korean state’s use of women’s bodies for profit.\n\nIn the late 1970s, KCWU expanded its focus to include Japanese atomic bomb victims in Korea, especially women whose lives were marked by radiation sickness, social ostracism, and intergenerational suffering. KCWU’s collaboration with Japanese Christian organizations to conduct field investigations gave voice to these women, setting a precedent for future campaigns around the “comfort women” issue. These efforts created the first public platform where such women could speak and be heard—a theological and political breakthrough. As Ko Seong-hwi notes, KCWU’s actions were “not merely humanitarian acts of Christian charity but a direct challenge to patriarchal modernization itself.” Their initiatives redefined Christian women’s activism from church-based charity work to critical engagement with national policy, gendered violence, and global justice.\n\nAccording to Lim’s broader analysis, KCWU’s role in the 1970s marked a paradigm shift in Protestant women’s education and empowerment. Transitioning from traditional evangelism-focused teachings to feminist theology and social engagement, KCWU “enabled women to become subjects of social participation and ecclesial reform.” They embraced a theological understanding of mission not confined to church walls but extending into the world, especially to sites of suffering and exclusion.\n\nKCWU's theological praxis proclaimed that “God’s mission begins not within the sanctuary, but at the margins.” Their work throughout the 1970s contributed significantly to South Korea’s democratization, the Christian feminist movement, and the emergence of human rights advocacy in both church and civil society. They exemplified what it meant to make the body—the most vulnerable site of modern exploitation—a medium of gospel testimony.\n\n\nCatholic Farmers’ Movement (CFM) and Catholic Women Farmers’ Association (CWFA)\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Catholic Farmers’ Movement (CFM) and the Catholic Women Farmers’ Association (CWFA) emerged as faith-based grassroots movements in response to the structural collapse of rural communities caused by rapid industrialization and urban concentration, the political marginalization of farmers, and the compounded oppression of women farmers. These organizations functioned not merely as relief or welfare bodies, but as autonomous collectives aiming to awaken consciousness, organize the rural population, and expose structural injustices. Their work was rooted in diocesan pastoral networks, national coordination, and international partnerships, establishing an alternative model for rural solidarity and cooperation.\n\nThe Catholic Farmers’ Movement originated in 1966 as a rural division of the Catholic Young Workers' Movement and was officially renamed “Catholic Farmers’ Movement” in 1972, expanding its structure into a national rural network. The principal agents of the movement were young farmers, clergy, and rural pastoral workers. Through publishing activities like the journal Nongchon Cheongnyeon (Rural Youth), the movement critically assessed rural realities and denounced state-led policies such as the Saemaul (New Village) Movement and the government’s focus on large-scale farming. As Park Kyung-yeon writes, “The Catholic Farmers’ Movement made it clear that the Church’s role was to realize social justice, and that proper action to achieve this was an appropriate posture,” emphasizing the fusion of religious ethics with socio-political engagement.\n\nOne of the CFM’s most impactful activities was the Rice Production Cost Survey, launched in 1975, which aimed to empirically demonstrate the real costs of rice production by having farmers themselves record detailed data in diary-like formats. This allowed farmers to reclaim recognition of their economic value and critique structural inequalities. According to the research, “Farmers, unlike before, gained confidence and strength... and began raising questions about the irrational agricultural structure and even the political system.” In addition, in the diocese of Wonju, the CFM cooperated with the Disaster Relief Committee to establish credit unions in rural communities. These credit unions, or Shinhyups, not only offered financial services but also engaged in the cooperative production, distribution, and consumption of goods. According to Kim So-nam, “By taking the lead in village governance, credit union officers brought about shifts in local political structures,” thereby democratizing village power that had been dominated by government-backed organizations. These activities, though sometimes parallel to government-led rural policies, represented a distinct and autonomous grassroots model of development.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Women Farmers’ Association was launched in 1977 under the original name “Catholic Rural Women’s Association,” with the goal of empowering women in agriculture and rural life. The inaugural president, Kim Young-ja, declared that “the rural women’s movement is not merely a women’s rights movement but one that tackles agricultural issues at their core… by confronting structural contradictions from the perspective of rural women and offering human dignity-based education and organizing.” The CWFA identified the dual burdens faced by women farmers—agricultural labor and domestic work—as well as the gender-based discrimination embedded within both rural and urban systems. Through their periodical Nongchon Bunya (Rural Women), they engaged in consciousness-raising work and advocated for recognition of women’s roles and rights. Rather than merely asserting women's rights, the CWFA advanced programs for political participation, educational access, and community engagement. One of their symbolic achievements was the 1985 \"Cattle Drive Protest,\" in which women farmers drove cattle into urban areas to protest agricultural policy—an event regarded as the “starting point of women-led farmers’ movements.” The CWFA laid the foundation for the creation of the National Association of Women Farmers in 1989.\n\nBoth organizations shared a common foundation in Catholic social teaching and emphasized consciousness-raising and grassroots organizing. While the CFM focused on cooperatives, cost surveys, and production reform, the CWFA introduced gender perspectives into the farmers’ movement, expanding its scope and constituency.\n\n\nTable 3.

This marked the formal launch of a movement that envisioned evangelism not simply as a matter of personal salvation, but as a collective mission for national spiritual renewal. Kim’s vision was that Korea as a whole should be reached, healed, and transformed by the gospel. This declaration led to a series of nationwide campaigns, beginning with the Chuncheon Holy City Movement and culminating in the historic EXPLO ’74 rally.\n\nThe National Evangelization Movement arose from a convergence of political tension, social transformation, and religious expansion in 1970s Korea. Politically, the Yushin Constitution of 1972 solidified Park Chung Hee's authoritarian regime. Despite its repressive mechanisms, the state permitted a degree of religious freedom when aligned with anti-communist nationalism. The evangelical rhetoric of national moral regeneration complemented the regime’s political ideology, allowing the movement to flourish under tacit approval. Economically and socially, Korea was undergoing rapid industrialization and urban migration, which caused the disintegration of traditional community structures. This left many individuals, particularly in urban slums, in search of new identities and social anchors. Churches stepped into this vacuum, offering a narrative of restoration and spiritual belonging. Religiously, Protestant churches had grown rapidly but were grappling with questions of public engagement. Theologians and church leaders debated whether faith should remain inward or engage with society. Kim Joon Gon reframed this debate by declaring that “the gospel is not complete until it transforms the nation,” thus providing theological legitimacy for mass mobilization.\n\nThe movement’s growth was marked by high-profile campaigns and strategic initiatives that integrated local and global evangelical networks. EXPLO ’74 was the most iconic event. Held in Seoul’s Yeouido Plaza and co-hosted by Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) and Billy Graham, the event drew over a million participants and marked Korea’s emergence as a global evangelical center. It symbolized the scale, ambition, and momentum of the movement. Equally influential was the Chuncheon-based Holy City Movement, launched in 1972. Inspired by Calvin’s Geneva and the ministry of Mun Jun Kyung, Kim Joon Gon envisioned “holistic evangelization,” where churches would spiritually and materially serve entire cities. This strategy emphasized community transformation and civic morality alongside individual salvation.\n\nThe success of the movement was underpinned by the fusion of theological conviction, political accommodation, cultural resonance, and organizational strategy. Theologically, Kim promoted an eschatological narrative in which Korea was a “chosen nation” destined to play a redemptive role in world missions. This “Second Israel” framing made the nation's history of suffering meaningful within a broader salvific story. Politically, the movement benefited from the regime’s indirect support. The government's anti-communist nationalism and desire for social cohesion meant that mass evangelical activities were tolerated, even when not explicitly endorsed. Culturally, the postwar generations were deeply affected by national division, war, and identity loss. The movement provided a unifying spiritual narrative that redefined minjok (the Korean nation) not only ethnically but as a sacred community. Strategically, CCC employed globally developed tools such as the Four Spiritual Laws and small-group discipleship, adapting them to Korean society. Their student networks, lay training, and mobilization tactics made the movement replicable and sustainable nationwide.\n\nThe movement left a transformative legacy on Korean Christianity and public life, despite facing criticism in later years. Within the church, it cemented the norm of mass evangelism and institutionalized lay ministry. CCC’s influence spread into nearly every major denomination, shaping a generation of church leaders and youth ministries. Socially, the movement modeled a form of public theology that envisioned civic life shaped by the gospel. The Holy City Movement, for instance, sought to moralize urban governance, improve public ethics, and embody Christian values in everyday life. However, critics have pointed out its limitations. Its spiritual-nationalist framework aligned too easily with authoritarian ideologies, and it largely avoided engagement with the democratization and human rights movements of the late 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, its cultural and theological impact on the Korean Protestant imagination is undeniable.\n\n\nCatholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) 천주교정의구현사제단\n\nThe Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) emerged in 1970s South Korea as a transformative force in the relationship between religion and politics, forging a new path for the church as a moral agent amid authoritarian rule and institutional silence. More than a reaction to political oppression, its founding and activities reflected a theologically grounded commitment to conscience and justice. The CPAJ was not merely a group of dissenting clergy; it embodied a significant theological movement within Korean Catholicism that asserted the prophetic role of the Church in the public sphere.\n\nThe catalyst for its formation was the arrest of Bishop Ji Hak-sun of the Wonju Diocese on July 6, 1974. He had been detained by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) for allegedly providing funds to poet Kim Chi-ha, who was arrested in connection with the People's Revolutionary Party (Mincheong) incident. Days later, on July 23, Bishop Ji delivered a public “Declaration of Conscience” from the garden of the hospital where he was under house arrest, proclaiming: “I have worked for human dignity and social justice; if that is a crime, I accept responsibility.”This statement reverberated throughout the Catholic community and galvanized younger priests to action, culminating in the organization of “National Prayer Meetings to Save the Nation.”\n\nBishop Ji’s arrest was more than a political incident; it was a theological rupture. For the first time, a senior church leader openly defied the regime, asserting that spiritual responsibility included ethical and political judgment. In response, priests across the country organized themselves under the banner of “justice,” and on September 26, 1974, the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice was officially founded. In a remarkable act of civil disobedience, priests led a procession with a cross at its forefront through the streets of Seoul following a Mass at Myeongdong Cathedral, marking the first street protest led by Catholic clergy in Korean history.\n\nTwo crucial factors shaped this development. First was the impact of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), which declared in Gaudium et Spes that “when the fundamental rights of people or the salvation of souls require it, the Church must pass moral judgment even in political matters”. Second was the increasingly repressive climate of the 1970s under President Park Chung-hee, which saw not only civil liberties curtailed but also the surveillance and persecution of religious organizations. The CPAJ interpreted these acts as violations not just of civil rights but of religious conscience, arguing, “There can be no preaching of the Gospel without justice and freedom”.\n\nOrganizationally, the CPAJ functioned as a loosely connected nationwide network of priests, but their actions were coordinated and symbolically powerful. The primary mode of resistance was the national prayer meeting, which served as both a liturgical and political space. From 1974 through 1980, over 200 such meetings were held across the country, aligned with campaigns against the Yushin Constitution, for the release of political prisoners, and in support of direct presidential elections. Their statements consistently called for the release of conscience prisoners, protection of basic human rights, freedom of religion, and economic justice for the people.\n\nImportantly, the CPAJ’s actions were not uniformly supported within the institutional Church. While the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Korea did not overtly oppose the group, it often remained cautious or silent, maintaining internal balance between progressive and conservative factions. Nonetheless, many within the Church acknowledged that the CPAJ contributed to a “renewed social trust in Catholicism,” particularly among students and intellectuals. Some even noted that the Church’s membership, which had stagnated in the early 1970s, began to increase partly due to the CPAJ’s visible commitment to justice.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the CPAJ had become one of the most respected moral voices in Korean society. Their acts—priests marching with crosses, defying state violence—captured the national imagination and elevated the Catholic Church to a central place in the democratization movement. As one priest stated, “Justice is part of evangelism; standing with the oppressed is the practice of the Gospel itself”.\n\nThe CPAJ’s legacy in 1970s Korea is not simply a record of reactive protest. It is an emblem of how faith, conscience, and theology can become the basis for structural critique and ethical resistance. Through its work, the CPAJ provided a model for how the Church could resist authoritarianism not by abandoning its mission but by embodying it more fully.\n\n\n ",
