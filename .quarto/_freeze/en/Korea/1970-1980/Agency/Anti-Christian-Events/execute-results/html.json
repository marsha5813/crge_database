Central to this effort was the revitalization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1974 under the name “Central Committee of the Korean Christian Federation,” which served both as a surrogate ecclesiastical body and a political organ aligned with Juche-based governance.\n\nThe 1972 Socialist Constitution, while formally recognizing “freedom of religion,” encoded this freedom within a framework of Juche hegemony. Article 54 granted the right to believe or not to believe in religion, but only insofar as it did not “disturb the order of society.” In this context, the KCF became the regime’s sanctioned vehicle for religious expression, structured not to promote theological autonomy but to project an image of religious coexistence within a socialist order.\n\nDuring the 1970s and into the 1980s, the KCF underwent structural reorganization. By 1985, it had expanded its regional presence to 50 branch offices, up from 35 in 1981. Official statistics indicated there were about 12,000 to 14,000 Christians and approximately 20 ordained pastors, as well as 520 house churches—framed as legitimate worship spaces, yet under tight surveillance and regulation by the state. These house churches functioned irregularly and were often led not by ordained clergy but by laypersons trained or guided by the KCF.\n\nNew showpiece churches, most notably Bongsu Church (1988) and Chilgol Church (1989), were constructed in Pyongyang. These institutions were showcased to foreign visitors as evidence of religious tolerance. However, as Jooseop Keum notes, “the KCF was not merely a propaganda tool, but an apparatus of religious redefinition under Juche ideology, modeling a form of minjung-centered ecclesiology that reflected socialist ethics.” This “socialist Christianity” emphasized national unity, anti-imperialism, and social harmony over spiritual salvation or scriptural orthodoxy.\n\nDespite the presence of officially recognized churches, a parallel and clandestine network of underground Christian communities persisted. These believers rejected the regime’s tightly controlled religious institutions and instead maintained faith through secret worship—gathering in basements, mountains, abandoned mines, or family homes. Though state sources acknowledged 520 house churches, missionary groups and defectors estimated there were between 100 and 2,000 underground churches by the late 1980s, with up to 30,000 adherents. Religious activity beyond the bounds of the KCF was viewed as subversive. The North Korean Human Rights White Paper documented numerous cases of imprisonment, torture, and execution for faith-related activities. Reports suggest that between 15,000 and 200,000 individuals were incarcerated in political prison camps during this period for religious reasons.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s thus witnessed the consolidation of a dual structure of Christianity in North Korea: a state-managed, ideologically useful religious system designed for propaganda and diplomacy, and a resilient underground church grounded in genuine spiritual devotion. One was publicly visible; the other lived in shadow—sustained by whispered prayers, generational memory, and enduring resistance. As Seong Lim Noh observes, “in order to secure international legitimacy, the DPRK reformulated Protestantism as compatible with socialism, reinterpreting its ethical values—such as compassion and justice—as coinciding with socialist morality.”[6]\n\n ",
