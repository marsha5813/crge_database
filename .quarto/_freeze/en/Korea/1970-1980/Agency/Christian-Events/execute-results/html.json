This movement, sparked by righteous indignation at institutional corruption, became a catalyst for nationwide democratic activism and transformed the role of the Church in society.\n\nThe catalyst for this movement was the corruption scandal surrounding Wonju MBC, in which the Diocese of Wonju was a minority shareholder. The station’s majority stakeholder, the 5.16 Scholarship Foundation, held 60% of the shares but failed to ensure transparent governance. Despite Bishop Ji's repeated protests, the government and the foundation ignored his demands for reform. This blatant disregard for justice ignited a deeper moral realization in Ji: “If a bishop can be treated like this, how much more would ordinary people suffer?” This experience awakened in him a sense of pastoral duty that transcended the sacristy and entered the realm of social justice.\n\nFrom righteous indignation emerged a bold and public campaign to confront institutionalized corruption. Bishop Ji organized public marches and protests demanding transparency, justice, and the eradication of entrenched political corruption. This was a courageous act during the height of the Park Chung-hee military regime, where dissent was often met with severe consequences. By directly challenging both the state and the colluding elites, Ji’s movement became the first visible sign of organized Catholic resistance to the dictatorship.\n\nBishop Ji’s anti-corruption movement evolved into a broader spiritual and political mission that called the entire Church to accountability. What began as a protest against a single instance of corruption quickly became a moral confrontation with the foundations of military authoritarianism. Ji recognized that the Church’s mission was not to retreat into spiritual neutrality but to speak out against injustice. His conviction was that “the Church must enter into society, understand its people, and give a Gospel-based response to their suffering”.\n\nThe campaign's historical significance lies in its redefinition of the Church’s social role and its inspiration of a wider resistance movement. Ji Hak-sun's protests laid the foundation for the creation of the Catholic Priests' Association for Justice, which would later become one of the most organized religious forces opposing the dictatorship. This movement also pushed the Catholic Church out of its previous posture of political detachment, bringing it into direct alignment with the struggles of the oppressed in Korean society.\n\nBy daring to speak truth to power in the face of systemic corruption, Bishop Ji’s campaign marked the beginning of a new era in Korean Christianity—an era where faith and justice walked hand in hand. His stance proved that pastoral care includes not only spiritual guidance but also the defense of human dignity against state oppression. The anti-corruption movement in the Diocese of Wonju thus serves not just as a protest, but as a prophetic voice in Korea’s modern democratic history.\n\n\nUrban Industrial Mission (UIM) and its Misson\n\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) in 1970s Korea was not merely a Christian outreach organization but a structured movement, representing a convergence of religion, social activism, and practical theology. Rooted in regionally autonomous mission stations like the Youngdeungpo Industrial Mission (YIM) and the Incheon Christian Urban Industrial Mission, this movement expanded beyond traditional evangelism to promote human dignity and industrial democracy in an era of rapid economic growth and labor exploitation. These regional missions functioned as decentralized but organized entities, linked through international ecumenical networks such as the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Leaders like Cho Ji-song, George Ogle, Jo Seung-hyeok, and Jo Hwa-soon moved into the factories, working and living alongside laborers, enacting what was called \"incarnational theology.\" Their mission was not merely to proclaim the gospel but to embody it through solidarity and structural transformation. As Cho Ji-song once critically confessed, “factory ministry itself was a mechanism of oppression that disciplined workers”. Importantly, the UIM reframed its target subjects—not as passive receivers of aid or faith but as co-agents of the mission. The Youngdeungpo Mission even rejected the traditional church hierarchy, declaring that “the worker is the church and the factory is the sanctuary.” This radical theology emerged from deep self-reflection on the limits of church language and ministry. As Jo Seung-hyeok testified, “Church language is a jargon understood only by believers—it has no meaning for workers”.\n\nSeveral landmark events during the 1970s clarified the Urban Industrial Mission’s character as a movement rather than merely an organization. The 1970 self-immolation of Jeon Tae-il, a garment worker protesting labor conditions, deeply shocked mission pastors. It catalyzed a theological shift from church-centered outreach to direct immersion in workers' lives. The Incheon Mission's Jo Seung-hyeok, who had worked undercover as a factory laborer, declared that the gospel must emerge from the lived experience of suffering.\n\nThe 1971 Kim Jin-su Incident at Han-young Textile, where the company’s hired thugs murdered a union member, also confirmed that the mission’s role was not neutral. The Incheon Mission responded by severing ties with its denomination and establishing an independent workers' church, committed to deeper engagement. In 1974, George Ogle’s forced deportation—after he publicly criticized the Park Chung-hee regime and prayed for the release of political prisoners—demonstrated the political cost of the mission's prophetic witness. His statement that “the government must abandon the constitution and build a new democracy” led to his removal, which stirred international human rights discourse.\n\nThe structure and praxis of UIM are vividly reflected in Jo Se-hee’s 1978 novel The Dwarf, which documents the industrial mission’s educational and communal ethos through its portrayal of “Eun-kang Workers’ Church.” The character Young-su attends a six-month education program teaching labor history, law, theology, and political economy. He states: “I studied the structure of industrial society, human organization, labor law, labor history, and theology”—a direct parallel to the leadership courses offered by YIM and Incheon UIM.\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission, therefore, must be understood as a structured mission movement—combining regional organization, educational praxis, theological radicalism, international solidarity, and political resistance. The following chart summarizes the dimensions of the UIM and its ties to major events:\n\n\nTable 4. Structure and key Linkages of the UIM as a Structured Movement\n\n| Dimension | Content | Representative Example / Citation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Organizational Form | Regional decentralized structure + international ecumenical networks | YIM, Incheon UIM, WCC, CCA |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Core Agents | Industrial mission pastors (Cho Ji-song, Ogle, Jo Seung-hyeok, etc.), workers, international allies | \"The worker is the church\" principle |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Major Events | Jeon Tae-il’s death, Kim Jin-su incident, Ogle’s deportation, Dongil Textile struggle | _The Dwarf_ depiction of “Eun-kang” workers’ church |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mission Activities | Incarnational theology, workers’ education, union support, documentation, advocacy | “Six-month leadership program” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Theological Basis | Incarnation, liberation theology, industrial democracy | “God dwells in the factory” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Social Significance | Worker empowerment, democratic resistance, church-society bridge | Separation from denominations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission of 1970s Korea represented a rare and radical convergence of gospel, justice, and social embodiment. By redefining mission as solidarity with the suffering and transformation of the structural sin of industrial capitalism, it posed a prophetic alternative to both institutional religion and authoritarian power. It remains one of the most significant models of missional engagement in Korea’s modern Christian history.\n\n\nReconfiguring Denominational Identity through Mission\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a pivotal moment in South Korean Protestantism—not merely as a period of numerical growth but as a time when major denominations redefined their identities through mission-centered transformation. Faced with sociopolitical shifts, internal theological challenges, and new opportunities for expansion, the Korean Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches responded through organized evangelism campaigns, international cooperation, and hybrid domestic-global mission structures. These efforts reshaped not only their outreach strategies but also the theological, organizational, and cultural foundations of each denomination.\n\nFor the Korean Methodist Church, the late 1960s were marked by stagnation in membership growth and an overemphasis on social engagement theology, which limited evangelistic vigor. In response, the denomination launched the nationwide “Five Thousand Churches and One Million Believers Movement” in 1974. This large-scale campaign represented a radical attempt to realign denominational focus around mission and evangelism. Supported by a detailed organizational plan and numerical targets at the district and regional levels, the movement aimed to establish 5,000 new churches and attract one million members within ten years. Its core message—“a movement of repentance and rekindled zeal for evangelism in light of ninety years of Methodist history”—captured the urgency of reformation. Between 1972 and 1974, church membership rose by tens of thousands annually, peaking at 374,710 in 1974. However, in 1975, growth dropped to just 2,398 new members, and by 1985, only 2,839 new churches had been planted—barely half of the original goal. Critics highlighted the movement’s reliance on numerical benchmarks and its lack of focus on discipleship, calling attention to the structural limitations of campaign-style evangelism.\n\nThe Baptist Church, recovering from post-war institutional weakness, rapidly expanded its membership and presence through a strategic partnership with the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) of the United States. Two key events—the Louisiana Evangelistic Crusade (1970) and the Florida Crusade (1978)—defined this decade for Korean Baptists. In the 1970 Louisiana Crusade, 81 American pastors and laypeople collaborated with Korean Baptists across 20 cities, drawing an estimated 250,000 attendees and resulting in over 11,000 public confessions of faith. These large-scale evangelistic efforts significantly contributed to the growth of Baptist churches, which reached 1,797 congregations by 1992. However, questions soon arose regarding the long-term retention and spiritual growth of these converts. Scholars criticized the lack of follow-up and discipleship systems, exposing the tension between evangelistic quantity and pastoral quality. Nonetheless, these movements helped define the Korean Baptist Church as a mission-driven, evangelical denomination with strong international linkages.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church, particularly its two dominant branches—Hapdong (Conservative) and Tonghap (Moderate)—entered the 1970s amid ongoing denominational fragmentation and theological disputes. Nevertheless, both branches experienced significant growth during this period. Between 1976 and 1977, Tonghap gained 172,132 new members, while Hapdong added approximately 60,000. This growth was fueled by massive city-based revivals, prayer mountain gatherings, and the “One Million Souls for Christ” campaign. Simultaneously, the church began developing international mission efforts, dispatching missionaries to the Philippines, Japan, and the United States. Timothy Kiho Park characterizes this dual expansion as an “integrated structure of domestic growth and international outreach,” reflecting a hybrid mission identity for the Korean Presbyterian Church. However, the denomination also faced internal theological tension between revivalist-charismatic practices and doctrinal orthodoxy, as well as debates about ecumenism and denominational unity.\n\nTaken together, the 1970s were not merely a time of growth for Korean Protestantism but a decade of missional redefinition. Each denomination responded to internal and external challenges by embracing mission not only as a practice but as the central axis for rearticulating theological identity, organizational priorities, and global engagement. These missional experiments—whether campaign-driven, cooperation-based, or hybrid in structure—shaped the long-term character and trajectory of South Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nTable 5. Mission-Driven Denominational Identity Formation \n\n| Denomination | Major Mission Movement | Quantitative Indicators | Key Issues and Debates | Representative Quotation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Methodist | Five Thousand Churches, One Million Believers (1974) | 1972–1975 membership: 314,143 → 377,108;goal: 5,000 churches; actual: 2,839 | Campaign-style evangelism criticized for neglecting discipleship | “A movement of repentance and renewed zeal for evangelism” |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baptist | Louisiana & Florida Evangelistic Crusades (1970, 1978) | 1970: 11,000 confessions of faith;1992: 1,797 churches | High response but low follow-up; debates over quantity vs. quality | “The crusade recorded the highest number of decisions for Christ” |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Presbyterian | One Million Souls Campaign;Domestic & Overseas Mission Expansion | Tonghap added 172,132 members in 1976–77;Hapdong added ~60,000 | Charismatic revivalism vs. theological orthodoxy;debates over unity | “PCK’s mission expanded naturally from local growth to global reach” |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n \n\nAnti-Yushin Movement\n\n\nThe anti-Yushin movement of the Korean Christian Church (PROK) in the early 1970s was not a spontaneous reaction, but the culmination of a theological, organizational, and intellectual groundwork developed throughout the 1960s. At the core of this movement was the church’s conviction that faith could not be separated from freedom, justice, and resistance to tyranny.\n\nThe Korean Christian Church (PROK), emerging from a 1950s theological liberalism centered on Kim Jae-jun, had long emphasized ecumenical engagement and social mission theology. From its very inception, it promoted a version of Christianity that rejected privatized spirituality and emphasized collective, public witness. In 1964, marking its 10th anniversary, the denomination declared a need for \"self-criticism and reformation,\" urging a “church of confession” that could respond to the moral crises of the times. The denomination’s official statements throughout the 1960s and early 1970s—including the Guidelines for Church Education (1970), Social Declaration Guidelines (1971), Declaration of Faith (1972), and Mission Policy (1973)—reflect this shift toward public theology, culminating in a formalized theological resistance to state violence and authoritarianism.\n\nThe theological foundation of this resistance was deeply rooted in the concept of “Missio Dei” (God’s mission). The PROK stated that the church’s task was to participate in “God’s will and God’s mission as Creator, Judge, and Redeemer… to fulfill the apostolic role of the church in this age”. According to the church's Mission Policy, adopted in 1973, the purpose of mission was not merely evangelism but social transformation: “to make the Korean people new through Jesus Christ… and make this country into God’s kingdom”. This comprehensive theology of liberation, contextualization, and total mission (전선교) challenged the dominant evangelical revivalism of the 1970s, including events such as Explo ’74. The PROK formally distanced itself from such state-aligned mass crusades, denouncing them as spiritually shallow and politically complicit.\n\nAlongside its theology, the PROK mobilized an institutional network of clergy, professors, laypeople, and students—many trained at Chosun Seminary (later Korea Theological Seminary)—to engage in overt resistance. Key figures included Kim Kwan-suk, Park Hyung-kyu, Moon Ik-hwan, Ahn Byung-mu, and Lee Woo-jung. These leaders formed what Ko Ji-soo describes as a “Protestant intellectual network” capable of articulating and leading a coordinated response to the Yushin dictatorship.\n\nThe defining moment came after the proclamation of the Yushin Constitution in October 1972, which was perceived as a direct violation of democratic and biblical values. The regime adopted a two-faced religious policy—suppressing critical churches while rewarding compliant ones. The PROK was quickly targeted. On December 13, 1972, Rev. Eun Myung-ki of Jeonju Nammun Church was arrested during worship for allegedly violating martial law—a shocking moment, as it marked the first instance in modern Korean history where a pastor was arrested during a prayer service.\n\nThe PROK responded swiftly. On December 18, the General Assembly executive committee expressed deep regret that “a pastor praying from the pulpit was arrested while believers were forcibly dispersed.” The Jeonbuk Presbytery issued a public statement calling it “an assault not just on an individual, but on the entire church and on sacredness itself,” affirming that “actions for faith and social justice are biblical truth and divine calling”.\n\nAs Rev. Eun’s indictment revealed that he had opposed martial law and the Yushin reforms, the church recognized the event as politically motivated persecution. The incident became a rallying cry, clarifying that “today’s mission” must include resistance to unjust power, defense of religious conscience, and the right to political dissent. The church submitted petitions to the Blue House, Prime Minister, Justice Minister, and KCIA, declaring, “This kind of government action was unheard of even under Japanese colonial rule”.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1976, the PROK’s resistance took various forms: nationwide prayer meetings, public statements, petitions, and declarations of conscience. These activities were consistently nonviolent and theologically grounded. The denomination rejected both passive spirituality and violent confrontation, positioning itself as a community of active yet peaceful resistance.\n\nThe movement was deeply influenced by the PROK’s political theology of freedom. Rev. Lee Hae-young wrote that Christian freedom meant relativizing the state: “When political authority violates human dignity and freedom, it intrudes upon the realm of God… and becomes a demonic force”. Freedom, in this view, was not a civil privilege granted by the state but a theological imperative derived from the first commandment: “You shall have no other gods before me”—which meant, in this context, “Do not absolutize any person, power, system, or state”.\n\nUltimately, the PROK’s anti-Yushin movement reflected a mature synthesis of theology, organization, and social conscience. By embracing Missio Dei, freedom of conscience, and public witness, the denomination shaped one of the most consistent and theologically robust expressions of resistance in 1970s Korean Christianity. Its legacy is not only institutional but spiritual—demonstrating how faith communities can resist authoritarianism through both word and deed.\n\n\nTable 6.

This period was marked by:\n\nCoexistence and experimentation: Theological debates and political actions were shared within major denominations.\n\nUnfixed boundaries: Evangelicals occasionally engaged in social action, while Minjung theology was still in the process of being formalized.\n\nVolatile historical context: Rapid industrialization, urban poverty, the authoritarian Yushin regime, and global theological trends arrived simultaneously.\n\nMoments of cooperation and conflict: Progressives and conservatives jointly opposed certain public policies (e.g., U.S. troop withdrawal), while they also clashed bitterly over political theology, labor issues, and social justice.\n\n\n“This was a time when political engagement and withdrawal, the people and the gospel, injustice and obedience—two emerging streams—began recognizing each other and colliding.”\n\n\nFormation and Development of Progressive Protestantism\n\nCommitment to participatory faithProgressives responded to dictatorship and inequality by aligning Christian faith with social engagement.→ “The political participation of Christians must be viewed as an expression and practice of faith.”\n\nLeadership in the anti–Third Term Amendment movementRev. Kim Jae-jun's public opposition to Park Chung-hee’s constitutional changes marked a defining moment.→ “Resistance to injustice is a testimony to justice… to change a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ is the worst kind of hypocrisy.”\n\nMinistry to the urban poor and laborersRev. Park Hyung-kyu led organizing training among slum residents and laborers to foster rights-based communities.→ “Residents were trained to organize and raise consciousness, seeking ways to live with dignity.”\n\nStudent-led solidarity through disguised factory workChristian university students immersed themselves in working-class environments to build empathy.→ “They entered factories under disguise and lived among workers… to form bonds of solidarity.”\n\nTheological interpretation of Jeon Tae-il’s self-immolationProgressive Christians saw his death as parallel to Christ's crucifixion, giving rise to Minjung theology.→ “A church that ignores Jeon Tae-il’s death is one that ignores the death of Jesus on the cross.”\n\n\nFormation and Development of Conservative Protestantism\n\nDefense of church-state separationConservative leaders rejected political involvement as a distortion of the gospel’s message.→ “If Christians impose political views in Christ’s name, they degrade the gospel.”\n\nAlliance with the authoritarian regimeThey praised Park Chung-hee’s constitutional reform and emphasized obedience to leaders.→ “We must pray daily for the head of the nation and its leaders.”\n\nOpposition to progressive social ministriesConservative leaders viewed urban and labor ministries as overly politicized and spiritually misplaced.\n\nRejection of theological parallels between Jeon Tae-il and ChristMany reacted furiously to progressive interpretations of Jeon's death.→ “Do you think Jesus is that cheap?” was one of the responses, along with threats of violence.”\n\n\nConflict and Cooperation: The Essence of the Transitional Phase\n\nThe 1970s were not a time of total separation. In several instances, both camps found brief common ground.\n\nShared concerns over national identity, anti-communism, and moral decay allowed joint actions (e.g., Korea–Japan Treaty protest).\n\nHowever, interpretations of social justice and the gospel increasingly diverged, deepening theological and political rifts.\n\n\nTable 7. Progressive vs. Conservative Protestantism\n\n| Category | Progressive Protestants | Conservative Protestants | Nature of Conflict |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Political engagement | Prophetic witness | Violates church-state separation | Theological conflict |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Regime posture | Critical and distanced | Cooperative and loyal | Justice vs. obedience |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Labor/poverty ministry | Direct solidarity | Viewed as secular/political | Opposing strategies |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jeon Tae-il’s death | Compared to Christ | Viewed as heresy | Clash in Christology |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Theology adopted | Minjung, liberation theology | Evangelical literalism | Contrasting paradigms |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Joint action potential | Select policy areas | Limited, conditional | Transition from cooperation to rupture |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nLink Between This Phase and the Explosive Growth of Korean Protestantism\n\nThough fraught with conflict, the transitional period played a pivotal role in the explosive expansion of Korean Protestantism during the 1970s. The growth was not just numerical—it was deeply intertwined with this era’s tensions.\n\n\nPolitical and social instability increased spiritual demand\n\nIndustrial unrest, dictatorship, and urban poverty drove many Koreans to churches in search of solace and belonging.→ “The church functioned as an alternative community, a space of refuge and strength in a chaotic society.”\n\n\nConservative institutional growth and populist strategy\n\nConservative churches focused on mass evangelism through revivalism, prayer meetings, and programs tailored to urban migrants.\n\nMega-churches like Yoido Full Gospel Church surpassed 200,000 members by the late 1970s.→ “While doctrinally conservative, Cho Yong-gi’s church used highly modern systems to attract both working-class and middle-class Koreans.”\n\nAlliances with political powers helped secure space and resources, further fueling their expansion.\n\n\nMoral capital built by progressive leaders\n\nProgressives did not grow in numbers, but their actions—supporting democracy, justice, and the oppressed—enhanced the ethical image of Christianity.\n\n→ “Leaders like Kim Jae-jun, Park Hyung-kyu, and Moon Ik-hwan granted Protestantism moral authority in the democratization movement.”\n\n\nComplementary growth: Quantity and quality\n\nThe polarized theological streams created a dual-track growth system:\n\n| Dimension | Conservative | Progressive |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main focus | Institutional, quantitative growth | Ethical and ideological depth |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Strength | Evangelism, worship structure | Justice, human rights, intellectual discourse |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Result | Church expansion | Cultural and moral influence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n→ “Ironically, the very conflict between the two camps became a catalyst for Protestantism’s multifaceted rise.” ",
