Kyung-Chik Han’s activities extended beyond mere evangelism or church growth. He stood at the center of a nationwide evangelization movement that was deeply entangled with the national agenda. Alongside Hwal-lan Kim, Han launched the National Evangelization Movement in 1965, shifting the focus from church-based outreach to a nationwide strategy grounded in interdenominational unity. In 1973, he played a leading role in organizing the Billy Graham Crusade and the Centennial Mission Conference, symbolizing a unifying force based on moderate evangelical ecumenism. Han introduced the concept of Evangelism in Depth, emphasizing that “evangelistic witness must be complete, profound, and continuous,” and that it must “be embodied in daily life, aiming for a universal and cosmic impact.” This approach extended the church's mission beyond traditional preaching to a more embedded and transformative presence in everyday life, targeting national evangelization as a long-term goal.\n\nHan’s evangelistic movement was not limited to personal conversion but was closely linked with a vision for constructing a Christian-based national ethos. From the post-liberation period onward, Han proclaimed that “the basic spirit of Christianity—human dignity, freedom, and equality—must serve as the foundation for the newborn Republic of Korea.” He once preached, “If we launch a gospel movement with Christian ideals to reform the ideology of the Korean people, I am confident that a righteous, independent Christian Korea will be swiftly realized.” These convictions resonated with President Syngman Rhee’s liberal democratic philosophy and contributed to shaping the foundational ideology of the Republic. Han once stated, “The Republic of Korea must be built upon the spirit of Christianity, and the church must function as the nation’s spiritual leadership institution.”\n\nIn alignment with Cold War anti-communist ideology, Han led the “Total Military Evangelization Movement,” aimed at converting soldiers to Christianity, and received official support from the government and military authorities. This represented a practical form of evangelical nationalism during an era of close church-state relations. However, his industrial mission faced setbacks as it conflicted with labor rights and social justice issues. In 1983, Youngnak Church ultimately withdrew support for the industrial mission, illustrating the difficulty of reconciling Han’s moderate evangelicalism with the more radical demands of labor activism.\n\nIn sum, Han’s ministry in the 1970s evolved from an individual-focused evangelicalism to a comprehensive vision encompassing church unity, nation-building, and structural social transformation. His efforts represent an unprecedented fusion of religious and social engagement in the history of modern Korean Christianity.\n\n\n장준하 張俊河 Chun-ha Chang\n\n08/27/1918 ~ 08/17/1975\n\n\nThe 1970s were not merely a period of resistance against the Yushin regime for Jang Jun-ha—they were the culmination of his intellectual struggle and the stage for his martyrdom. Through the monthly journal Sasangge (Thought World), which he founded in 1953, he declared, “Our people must end the history of slavish submission and recover our own tradition and freedom,” embracing journalism as a moral mission to realize the public good. Sasangge was not merely a publication—it was a living forum of public discourse through which Jang shared his political philosophy, nationalism, and democratic ideals with the public. When Sasangge was forcibly shut down by the Park Chung-hee regime, Jang saw it not just as an act of censorship, but as an assault on critical intellectual space and liberal-nationalist discourse. He stated that it was “time to change our method of struggle against the perpetrators of May 16 [the 1961 coup],” and shifted fully into the realm of active politics. The closure of Sasangge represented not merely the silencing of a journal but the violent suppression of a free and ethical public sphere.\n\nAs a Christian, Jang Jun-ha integrated his faith with his political ethics. While studying at a theological seminary in Tokyo, he was conscripted into the Japanese army as a student soldier. However, unable to endure the humiliation and racial discrimination, he defected and joined the Korean Liberation Army. His decision was rooted not only in nationalism but also in a spiritual conscience. “My life only has value from this moment onward,” he resolved, equating martyr-like faith with national awakening. To him, the idea that “a Christian cannot remain silent in the face of falsehood and oppression” was not a metaphor—it was a conviction. Throughout his writings and speeches, the themes of “conscience” and “justice” repeatedly appear, grounded in theological vision. He declared, “If the life of the nation is cut off, then my own life has no meaning. A self that exists apart from a suffering people is no longer truly a self.” In this way, he understood the realization of the self as a spiritual act of communal solidarity—one could not stand before God without standing with the people. Christian faith, for Jang, was the basis for a public calling. He believed “the press is the weapon of civil rights, and its mission is like that of salt and light,” seeing journalism not simply as reporting, but as prophetic testimony. His resistance to the Yushin regime in the 1970s was not merely political rationalism—it was a moral imperative, born of a Christian commitment to truth and righteousness. In this regard, he is remembered not only as a nationalist but as a prophetic intellectual rooted in the Christian theology of justice.\n\nEven in his final years, Jang maintained strong ties to Christian communities. After his death in 1975 under suspicious circumstances at Yaksa Peak in Pocheon, many in the Korean Protestant world mourned him as “a modern-day Amos.” His death was not viewed as a political incident alone, but as a form of martyrdom—an embodiment of Christian conscience and sacrificial spirit.\n\n\n김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim\n\n09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987\n\n\nKim Jae-jun emerged in the 1970s as a symbol of Christian resistance grounded in liberal theology amidst the oppressive Yushin regime in South Korea. From the anti-third-term amendment movement in 1969 to his role as a representative of the National Council for the Protection of Democracy in 1971 and his outspoken opposition to the 1972 Yushin Constitution, Kim persistently confronted dictatorship. His actions drew increasing scrutiny from the state, leading to prolonged house arrest and surveillance. In March 1974, at the age of 74, he departed for Toronto, Canada, under the pretense of a brief stay. However, this departure effectively became a decade-long political exile. As he later recalled, he initially intended to stay abroad “only for two to three months,” but circumstances forced him into a prolonged absence from his homeland.\n\nHis exile was not an escape but a strategic relocation that opened a new front in the democratization struggle through international solidarity. Shortly after his arrival in Canada, Kim joined the Washington-based Korean Congress for Democracy and Unification (Hanmin-tong), an overseas organization that championed Kim Dae-jung’s “Democracy First, Unification Later” policy. Kim offered theological and moral legitimacy to the organization’s mission. He argued, “Justice without freedom undermines the essence of humanity,” affirming that political liberty was an extension of his theological convictions. His involvement symbolized a powerful convergence between liberal Christianity and democratic political ideals and served to strengthen the international network supporting Korea’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nKim’s political vision shifted in the 1970s from Cold War anti-communism to a human-centered historical consciousness. As a North Korean refugee and staunch anti-communist, he initially resonated with conservative nationalist views. However, he came to believe that “the suffering of the Korean people cannot be confined within the dichotomy of regime confrontation.” This realization led him to reframe the unification issue not merely as a geopolitical struggle but as a question of human rights and social justice. In line with Kim Dae-jung’s three-stage unification proposal, Kim emphasized that democracy and human dignity must precede any political reunification.\n\nThough Kim did not explicitly label himself a proponent of Minjung theology, his theology of participation laid the groundwork for it. He was deeply critical of the escapist tendencies of Korean Christianity, famously stating, “The slogan ‘Believe in Jesus and go to heaven’ ultimately promotes indifference to social reality or even encourages retreat from it”. He emphasized that the church must act as “salt and leaven” in society and that theology must be lived through the pursuit of justice, freedom, and human dignity. “The church,” he wrote, “must declare God's will by engaging in political critique, participation, action, supporting the best possible political models, and raising consciousness among clergy, laity, and those outside the church alike”. From this theological foundation, Kim advanced the concept of “theology of humanization,” in which the preservation of human freedom and dignity supersedes all political systems. His liberalism was not merely an importation of Western democratic ideals but a contextual theological response to Korea’s divided and repressive realities. His declaration that “the state has no reason to exist unless it guarantees human freedom and welfare” reflects his unwavering resistance to totalitarian rule.\n\nKim Jae-jun’s activities in the 1970s were not merely anti-Yushin protests but a holistic engagement that wove together theology and politics, domestic and global alliances, resistance and participation. He simultaneously pursued church reform and societal democratization, anchoring his work in a theological commitment to human liberation, national reconciliation, and moral responsibility. His life exemplified how Christian theology could be a driving force in the fight for justice and democracy.\n\n\n문익환 文益煥 Ik-hwan Moon\n\n06/01/1918 ~ 01/18/1994\n\n\nMoon Ik-hwan's life was theology itself, and his theology was the language of participation and obedience to the suffering people of his time. He was remembered as “a man who stormed against unjust power like a hurricane, yet approached bare-handed workers and the socially marginalized with the gentleness of a lamb,” and someone who “carried a more delicate and humble sensibility than a sprig of baby’s breath in his heart” as a pastor and spiritual leader. These seemingly contradictory qualities were not disjointed but rather a dialectical fruit of his lived theology.\n\nHis theological praxis took public form when he became the chair of the joint translation committee for the Old and New Testaments of the Bible under the Korean Bible Society in 1968. He did not view this as an academic task but as a transformative spiritual experience, stating that it was like “witnessing the collapse of three Jericho walls: the wall between Protestants and Catholics, the wall of theological prejudice, and the wall between Hebrew and Korean ways of thinking.” He resigned from his professorship and pastoral post to devote himself fully to this mission, and in the process, began writing poetry. He once confessed, “I did not start writing poetry to be judged as a poet but to discover myself. I sensed that this poetic activity might mark a turning point in my theological thinking.” His poetry carried the rhythm of the Hebrew Psalms and gradually evolved into a prophetic language of consolation and awakening for the Korean people. As one article noted, Moon was \"the one who planted the language of the Bible into the Korean Peninsula,\" making the Word of God accessible through the Korean language.In his translation, for instance, the Hebrew term shalom was not merely rendered as “peace,” but as a comprehensive reality of justice, completeness, life, and communion.\n\nA turning point in his public engagement came in 1975 with the suspicious death of Jang Jun-ha, a fellow democracy activist. “At the very moment of his burial,” Moon later recalled, “I vowed to live out his life in his place.” This resolution led to the drafting and public reading of the March 1st Declaration for National Salvation in 1976. But this transition did not emerge from a vacuum; he had already been involved in workers’ advocacy after the 1970 self-immolation of laborer Jeon Tae-il. He frequently visited the Cheonggye union to support and console workers. Jeon’s mother, Lee So-seon, remembered Moon as “a father figure who protected us with his entire being.”\n\nMoon radically reimagined the church. In a sermon, he declared, “The church is not a place that drugs people with religion and quietly sends them off to the next world—it must be a place that brings people to life.” He added, “We don’t need dead Christians who only whimper their way into heaven; we need churches overflowing with creative believers whose eyes shine with moral power, like a living, breathing body.” At the core of his theology was a structural integration of love, justice, peace, and life. “Justice,” he wrote, “is love erupting in anger. It is the social expression of love. Biblical peace is not mere calm but the fullness of life. Perfection, as Christ commanded, is perfection in love.” Peace (shalom), therefore, was not merely an eschatological hope but a historical mandate grounded in solidarity and resistance.\n\nUnification for Moon was not a political option but a theological imperative. He recalled his father’s words: “My father used to mutter even on his deathbed, ‘For our nation to be unified, the church must be united first.’” For Moon, nationalism was never to be confused with state ideology but understood as a “people-centered nationalism.” He believed “the common people, unlike those with vested interests, are naturally peace-oriented because they have nothing to defend with war.” His final major work, A History of the Hebrew People, was a theological and poetic retelling of the Bible from the perspective of the oppressed, connecting the exodus of the Hebrews with the aspirations of the Korean people. It has been evaluated as “a theological testimony of the feet that walked the path of liberation,” and a cornerstone of Korean Minjung theology.\n\n\n장기려 張起呂Gi-ryeo Jang\n\n10/05/1911 ~ 12/25/1995\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dr. Chang Kee-Ryo stood at the intersection of medicine, faith, and social justice. As a surgeon, educator, and Christian, he pioneered liver disease treatment in Korea and laid the groundwork for equitable health coverage through the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative. His holistic approach to healthcare—anchored in Christian ethics and civic responsibility—defined a new model of medical professionalism in postwar Korea.\n\nDr. Chang was the first in Korea to perform successful liver resections for liver cancer, initially in 1943, and later a large-volume hepatectomy in 1959. These groundbreaking procedures were not only clinical milestones but also reflections of his deep-seated belief in the healing ministry of medicine. As one colleague testified, “Dr. Chang believed that the body is governed by natural laws and that disease was a deviation from physiological order… this belief enabled him to succeed in what was then considered an impossible liver surgery”. In 1974, he founded the Korean Liver Research Association and served as its first president, institutionalizing his commitment to advancing hepatic medicine. However, Dr. Chang's work extended beyond operating rooms and laboratories. His founding of the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative in 1968 was a pivotal moment in Korea’s social welfare history. This nonprofit health insurance model was built on egalitarian principles: monthly premiums were flat regardless of age or health status, and no one was excluded from enrollment. At a time when the national health insurance law (1963) was still nominal and unenforceable due to lack of government funding, Dr. Chang’s initiative filled a critical gap. The Cooperative was deeply rooted in Christian values. Weekly Bible studies, known as the “Busan Meeting,” provided the intellectual and spiritual foundation for the insurance scheme. Dr. Chang described Christian love as “a spirit of cooperation” and sought to embody this in the Cooperative’s operations. He viewed healing not only as a clinical act but as an expression of divine compassion, once writing, “I believe the essence of medical practice lies in identifying with the suffering of the patient as if I were the patient myself”.\n\nEven more striking was his personal lifestyle: he refused to own property, lived in a small hospital dormitory after retirement, and once quietly opened a back door to let a patient without money “escape” hospital billing. When the national health insurance program began in 1989, Dr. Chang voluntarily dissolved the Cooperative and handed over its resources to the state—a gesture that epitomized his commitment to public good over institutional survival. Dr. Chang's professionalism extended into his teaching. He inspired generations of students with an almost ascetic devotion to truth and precision. One of his most famous declarations was: “A physician who does not leave behind written reflections on both success and failure is no more than a parasite among his peers”. Despite physical decline after a stroke, he continued correcting errors in his publications from his hospital bed.\n\nTo understand his legacy fully, one must see that Dr. Chang practiced medicine not as a commercial contract but as a sacred calling. He once declared, “From the day I became a doctor, I have never forgotten my promise to care for patients who cannot afford treatment. This is the yardstick by which I measure whether my life has been a success or a failure”.\n\n\n서남동 徐南同 Nam-dong Seo\n\n07/05/118 ~ 07/19/1984\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Reverend Seo Nam-dong emerged as a leading intellectual and practitioner who reshaped the landscape of Korean Christian theology. At the center of the Korean Association of Christian Professors (KACP), Seo played a pivotal role in articulating the theological foundations of ecumenical development theology and was instrumental in laying the groundwork for minjung theology—a theology rooted in the lived experiences and struggles of the oppressed.\n\nIn 1971, during the 9th KACP Annual Conference, Seo presented a seminal paper titled “The Humanization of Modern Science and Technology,” where he critically examined how technological advancement contributed to the alienation of human beings. He proposed that the path to humanization in the era of scientific and technological development lay in achieving balance and resonance between “technology and humanity, ideas and material, intuition and labor”. This reflects Seo’s effort to forge a theological response not just to spiritual questions but to the socio-material conditions of modern industrial life.\n\nThe Korean Association of Christian Professors, inspired by the World Council of Churches (WCC), developed the concept of the “Theology of Humanization” in line with global ecumenical missions. It sought to counteract the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and urbanization by restoring human dignity and agency. As a central leader and organizer of KACP, Seo contributed significantly to framing modernization not as a purely material project, but as a process rooted in human desire for liberation from poverty and oppression. He stated that modernization stemmed from “a fundamental longing for the liberation of human autonomy and creativity”.\n\nSeo's influence extended internationally. In 1973, although initially denied a travel visa, he was listed as a participant in several ecumenical conferences abroad and later preached the closing sermon at the joint Korea-Japan Christian Professors' Conference. His role in KACP was not only theological but also deeply political. In 1975, under Emergency Measure No. 9, he was forced into early retirement from Yonsei University. This act of political repression exemplified the state's crackdown on Christian intellectuals, including KACP's presidents, general secretaries, and leading thinkers.\n\nSeo Nam-dong’s theology was especially attentive to the concept of han—the deep sorrow and resentment of the oppressed in Korean cultural consciousness. He argued that theology must begin by responding to the wailing of the minjung (the people) and the groans of women. For Seo, the voices of the suffering were not just subjects of compassion but the very manifestation of God’s presence. As one article put it, “He heard the voice of God in their tears”. Hence, his radical declaration that “the minjung is Christ” underscored a profound theological shift: God is present not in the powers of the church or state, but in the depths of the people’s pain and struggle. Rather than confining his work to church reform, Seo advanced a liberative theology that confronted the structural violence of the South Korean state. He became known as a priest of han, embodying the pain and resistance of the oppressed. His theology was not abstract theorizing but a lived response to the urgent question, “Whose voice does theology listen to?” As one scholar observed, “Seo Nam-dong’s entire life was theology itself, and his theology was a cry for life and liberation”.\n\nIn conclusion, Seo Nam-dong was not only a theologian but also a prophetic public intellectual whose work shaped the Korean democratization movement and ecumenical theology of the 1970s. His thought continues to resonate today, urging theologians and Christians alike to engage with the cries of the marginalized and the demands of justice.\n\n\n지학순  池學淳  Daniel Ji Hak-soon\n\n09/09/1921 ~ 03/12/1993\n\n\nBishop Ji Hak-sun’s defiance of authoritarian rule in 1970s South Korea was not only an act of political courage but a theological embodiment of the Church’s mission to stand with the oppressed. His resistance emerged from the crossroads of global Catholic reform and Korea’s escalating dictatorship, culminating in a life that blurred the boundary between priesthood and prophetic activism.\n\nHaving studied canon law in Rome and ordained as bishop of the newly established Diocese of Wonju in 1965, Ji returned to Korea deeply influenced by the Second Vatican Council, which called the Church to recognize the “joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties” of all people, especially the poor and afflicted, as its own concerns. He later declared, “Priests must concretely practice the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social teachings of Popes John XXIII and Paul VI”. For Ji, these were not abstract exhortations but marching orders.\n\nHis pastoral leadership quickly collided with the growing repression of the Park Chung-hee regime. South Korea’s rapid industrialization, managed through crony capitalism and military control, led to deepening inequality, rural impoverishment, and urban labor exploitation. The people under Ji’s pastoral care—including coal miners, poor farmers, and factory workers—were among the most vulnerable. In this context, Ji came to see his role not merely as shepherd of souls, but as a defender of their dignity and survival. The moment of radical transformation came in 1970, when Ji confronted corruption in the establishment of Wonju MBC, a regional broadcasting station. Despite holding a minority share, his diocese faced stonewalling and disregard from the majority owner, the 5.16 Scholarship Foundation—a regime-aligned entity. Ji later reflected: “If a bishop is treated like this, what hope is there for ordinary people?”. This realization marked his shift from moral concern to civic resistance. Ji responded by organizing street marches and public protests to denounce institutionalized corruption, launching the Church into open confrontation with the state. This marked the first time a sitting bishop had taken such direct action against state authority in modern Korean history. The Park regime labeled his actions subversive, linking him to communist sympathizers merely because he advocated for human rights and defended figures like Kim Ji-ha, a poet and activist affiliated with Ji’s diocese.\n\nThe confrontation reached its apex in March 1974, when Ji signed the “3.1 Declaration for National Salvation,” a multi-faith statement condemning the Yushin Constitution and demanding democratic reforms. His participation was unprecedented: “I could no longer remain silent,” Ji explained later, describing his act as a “conscience declaration” in line with his priestly calling. This led to his arrest by the Korean CIA, imprisonment, and military trial. The Vatican expressed concern, and even U.S. diplomatic records show that his detention alarmed foreign observers, with one official warning that “a trial of a high-ranking clergyman would backfire internationally”. Yet Ji’s imprisonment ignited a powerful movement. His arrest became the catalyst for the formation of the Catholic Priests' Association for Justice, signaling a historic shift in the Korean Catholic Church’s posture—from cautious neutrality to prophetic engagement. As one scholar noted, “Ji’s suffering awakened the conscience of the Korean Church, showing that faith without justice was empty”.\n\nTheologically, Ji’s activism was grounded in what he called a “Christ-centered principle.” He viewed his ministry as a continuation of Christ’s suffering love for the world. “Like Christ carrying the cross, I too am resolved to suffer,” he wrote in his episcopal motto. His social engagement, including support for cooperatives, flood victims, and political prisoners, was an extension of this conviction that the Church must serve as “a sacrament of Christ in the world”.\n\nBishop Ji’s legacy in the 1970s lies not only in his personal resistance but in his transformation of the Korean Catholic Church into a voice of conscience in public life. By refusing to separate faith from justice, he redefined what it meant to be a bishop—not an administrator of rituals, but a witness to truth in the face of tyranny.\n\n\n김지하 金芝河 Ji-ha Kim\n\n02/04/1941 ~ 05/08/2022\n\n\nKim Ji-ha was not merely a poet in the 1970s, but a prophetic voice who confronted dictatorship with literature, faith, and philosophy. His works traversed the realms of literature, religion, and politics, giving expression to the suffering and resistance of the Korean people while shaping new theological and ecological discourse.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Kim Ji-ha made a powerful intervention into public discourse through his satirical poem Ojeok (The Five Bandits), a direct attack on the corruption of the Park Chung-hee regime. “After being imprisoned for his opposition to the 1964 Korea-Japan Treaty, Kim began articulating the suffering of the people through poetry”. His works were politically charged enough to provoke state suppression. For instance, his 1972 poem Bieo (Rumors), published in the Catholic monthly Creation, was immediately censored by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. The magazine was forced to shut down, and its editor and publisher had to resign.\n\nYet Kim's thought evolved through prison confinement, culminating in a spiritual awakening that redefined his philosophical trajectory. While incarcerated, he encountered The Phenomenon of Man by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a reading that proved transformative. He later recalled, “From that day, I realized I was no longer merely a believer of Cheondoism, but was returning to the original Donghak (Eastern Learning) of my ancestors”. This realization, which he called “a lopsided balance,” became the foundation for his new cosmic vision of life, which sought to integrate Eastern spirituality and Western evolutionary theology.\n\nKim did not see his newfound life philosophy as a retreat from politics. Rather, he framed it as a radical reinterpretation of the people’s struggle. He argued that “‘life,’ ‘ecology,’ and ‘the people’ are not separate concepts but interchangeable terms within the same discursive lineage”. In his poem Museun (What), he writes, “Thinking and thinking, and blocked in thought, I suddenly realized my life isn’t simple,” describing the universe not as distant but alive and teeming within him. Through this “biospiritual” poetics, he pushed beyond anthropocentrism and embraced a universal communion of beings. This transition influenced not only literature but also Korean theology. Kim Ji-ha’s poetry provided vital inspiration to theologian Suh Nam-dong, a founding figure of Korean minjung theology. “Suh Nam-dong even referred to Kim as a minjung theologian,” recognizing the deep theological significance of his literary imagination. Suh, who introduced Teilhard’s theology and the concept of Christian biopolitics to Korea, found in Kim’s life-centered poetry a theological language for liberation.\n\nMeanwhile, Kim was also deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching. Under the guidance of Chang Il-soon and Bishop Ji Hak-soon in the Diocese of Wonju, he studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and several papal encyclicals. “Kim Ji-ha recalled studying encyclicals and council documents while staying at Chang Il-soon’s home in 1970–71”. His play The Crowned Jesus embodies this synthesis: in a key scene, a nun rebukes a priest’s political apathy by invoking Catholic teachings—“Mother and Teacher, Peace on Earth, all the decisions of the Council, the words of the Pope, and the bishops’ calls for social justice”—in what is essentially Kim’s own voice speaking through her⁷. What makes The Crowned Jesus especially striking is that Kim’s critique did not merely rely on doctrine but reimagined the mutual agency of Jesus and the oppressed. In one scene, Jesus tells a leper: “You must liberate me. Only you can. Your poverty, wisdom, and courage against injustice are what free me. You have opened my mouth”. This reciprocal soteriology, in which the oppressed also save the Savior, reflects Kim’s theological innovation grounded in the Korean context.\n\nKim Ji-ha’s 1970s journey was thus not only literary and political but also theological and cosmological. His fusion of Catholic teaching, Donghak, Teilhardian evolution, and minjung consciousness rendered him not just a protest poet but a radical thinker seeking new foundations for humanity, justice, and creation itself.\n\n\n이우정 李愚貞 Woo-jung Lee\n\n08/01/1923 ~ 05/30/2002\n\n\nLee Woo-jung (1923–2002) was a leading Christian women’s rights activist in 1970s Korea, who bridged faith and action to address gender inequality, dictatorship, and systemic injustice. Her life and work exemplified a deeply theological commitment to human dignity, rooted in personal experience, Christian ethics, and resistance to the patriarchal and authoritarian structures of her time.\n\nBorn in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Lee was raised in a household shaped by contrasting influences: her grandfather Lee Hae-jo was a progressive educator who emphasized modern learning, while her father adhered strictly to Confucian values. Her early experiences of gender discrimination—such as being denied educational opportunities afforded to her brother—awakened her sensitivity to injustice. As a high school student, she even attempted to run away from home to avoid being conscripted into the Japanese military sexual slavery system. Eventually, her encounter with Christianity at a “Religion Church” in Seoul and her studies at Chosun Theological Seminary brought her into the orbit of influential figures like Kim Jae-jun and Moon Ik-hwan. Kim, in particular, emphasized the theological view that “in God there is no male or female,” affirming Lee’s dignity and instilling confidence in her.\n\nIn the 1970s, Lee emerged as a key figure in the Christian women’s movement. As president of the newly established Korean Church Women United (KCWU), she led efforts to confront state-condoned sex tourism targeting Japanese male visitors to Korea. Outraged by the exploitation of Korean women for foreign exchange, she declared: “We grieve over the reality that our daughters are being defiled under the excuse of earning foreign currency. We must protect our daughters”. She famously challenged the government by stating, “If prostitutes are the vanguard of earning foreign currency, then offer up your own daughters first”. Her leadership was instrumental in organizing education programs for women, lobbying government officials, and forming solidarity networks with Japanese and international women’s groups.\n\nLee’s feminism was grounded in a Christian anthropology of human dignity. She believed that women’s liberation was not simply about equal rights but about recovering their full humanity. “Women are oppressed in the family and workplace from a perspective that fundamentally denies their equal personhood,” she wrote, identifying sexism as a deeply embedded cultural structure. This philosophy undergirded her involvement in the 1976 March 1st Declaration for National Salvation, where she joined religious and political leaders in publicly denouncing President Park Chung-hee’s authoritarian regime. During her trial, she stated, “I participated out of a desire to defend freedom of religion and to call attention to injustice,” and declared, “I hope our society becomes one where people are treated as human beings”.\n\nHer political awakening was deepened by the death of labor activist Jeon Tae-il in 1970, which she described as “a moment that burdened my heart with a sense of debt to the workers, especially women workers”. Rather than turning away, she moved toward the suffering, engaging in labor rights advocacy, urban poor movements, and anti-torture campaigns throughout the decade. Lee later became a pioneer in Korean feminist theology. She advocated for a re-reading of Scripture through women’s eyes and criticized male-dominated theological frameworks. “True minjung theology must include the issue of women,” she emphasized, calling for a theology where women could participate freely in God’s salvific work. Her theological work was not merely academic but connected to grassroots activism, including support for unjustly fired female workers and campaigns for the rights of comfort women, factory workers, and displaced residents.\n\nLee Woo-jung’s legacy is a testament to a faith that walks alongside the oppressed and insists on their full humanity. She refused to separate theological reflection from lived reality, declaring through word and deed that “a single human being is more precious than the entire universe.”\n\n\n계의돈 Robert L. Goette\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dr. Robert L. Goette (Korean name: Gye Eui-don) emerged as a pivotal figure in evangelical higher education missions in Korea. As a lay educational missionary sent by the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), he realized an integrated model of mission that combined scientific education and gospel proclamation, primarily through his work at Hannam University. The 1970s marked a turning point in his ministry, as he transformed from a chemistry professor into a born-again evangelist committed to campus evangelization.\n\nHis spiritual renewal took place during a sabbatical in the United States in 1970, when he attended a Leadership Training Course (LTC) led by Dr. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC). There, he heard the verse, “For by grace you have been saved through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8–9). He confessed that this led him to repent of his misguided belief that salvation could be earned through good deeds, and he received assurance of salvation. From that point forward, he declared, “Teaching chemistry alone cannot transform people—only the Word of God can truly change lives.”\n\nUpon returning to Korea in 1971, his ministry focus shifted entirely. Goette regarded everyone—students, faculty, and alumni—as targets of evangelism, and prioritized personal evangelism and discipleship over programs or events. “His ministry focused not on events or programs, but on the salvation of individual souls,” noted a colleague. Inspired by 2 Timothy 2:2, he practiced spiritual multiplication by training faithful students who would, in turn, share the gospel with others.\n\nOne of his most distinctive contributions in the 1970s was institutionalizing creation science education. Beginning in 1976, he pioneered Korea’s first accredited university course on the topic, titled Bible and Science. At a time when Korean society was heavily influenced by scientific materialism and evolution, he taught that “many Koreans rejected the Bible because they had been falsely taught that evolution was factual and the Bible was wrong.” During a sabbatical, he collected educational materials—including films, books, and audio tapes—from the U.S. and translated them into Korean. He also wrote the Korean preface for the translated edition of Scientific Creationism by Henry Morris. Goette’s creation science class became foundational to the development of Christian worldview studies at Hannam University and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) in 1981. His course eventually enrolled close to 10,000 students and was adopted by other universities throughout Korea.\n\nHis evangelism extended beyond the classroom. In 1973, he opened a Christian Book Service Center on campus, providing free or low-cost access to Bibles and Christian literature in both English and Korean. He also practiced an ecumenical, holistic model of mission that integrated gospel witness with social responsibility. For example, he paid for surgery for a disabled female student and supported a hit-and-run victim’s recovery by giving him work as a groundskeeper and paying him a dignified salary.\n\nDr. Goette’s 1970s ministry exemplified a holistic, Christ-centered witness that combined intellectual rigor with personal piety and compassionate service. His legacy extends far beyond Hannam University’s chemistry department; it represents a model of evangelical mission that transformed lives, institutions, and ultimately, the trajectory of Christian higher education in Korea.\n\n\n김수환 추기경 金壽煥 Stephen Kim Sou-hwan\n\n07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009\n\n\nCardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan was a pivotal figure in redefining the Catholic Church’s role in Korean society during the turbulent 1970s. Drawing on the reformist spirit of the Second Vatican Council, he led the Korean Catholic Church toward becoming a “Church in the world,” grounded in justice and human dignity. Even under the authoritarian regime of President Park Chung Hee, he never relinquished the Church’s commitment to truth and compassion. When Bishop Ji Hak-sun was arrested in connection with the Mincheonghakryeon (National Democratic Youth and Student Federation) case in 1974, Cardinal Kim took the extraordinary step of directly meeting President Park to request Ji’s release. As one scholar notes, “Cardinal Kim made it clear that the Church could no longer remain silent,” and the incident marked a critical turning point in the Church’s engagement with social and political issues.\n\nCardinal Kim’s social involvement stemmed not from political ambition but from theological conviction. He declared, “Now the Church must give everything to serve society and become a Church in the world,” making it clear that faith must engage the public sphere. Under his leadership, Myeongdong Cathedral became not only a space of worship but also a symbol of democracy. He welcomed interreligious dialogue, inviting leaders of Buddhism, Protestantism, and other traditions to build peace and unity. Responding to a rapidly changing society, he emphasized, “Society demands that we bear witness to the Christ you profess by the way you live.” Cardinal Kim’s leadership stood out most clearly in his cautious but firm stance toward the Park regime. He did not openly attack the Yushin Constitution, yet he questioned the legitimacy of a system that trampled on human rights and dignity. When Bishop Ji was re-arrested after his \"Declaration of Conscience,\" Cardinal Kim avoided inflammatory rhetoric but articulated the Church’s position through quiet yet clear statements. His prudence allowed him to serve as a mediator between the radical priests of the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice and the institutional Church, preventing fragmentation while maintaining the Church’s moral credibility.\n\nAt a time when Korea was racing toward industrial development, Cardinal Kim raised urgent concerns about the cost of progress. As early as the 1970s, he stated, “Today’s society is clearly unhealthy. It is filled with spiritual and material pollution,” warning that Korea’s drive for modernization was eroding human dignity. “In the midst of material growth, humanity is deteriorating,” he argued, pointing to a system where spiritual poverty prevailed despite economic expansion. His critique was not merely economic or political—it was deeply ecological and theological. He saw the suffering of farmers, workers, and the urban poor as a sign of a deeper crisis: the loss of humanity and harmony with creation.\n\nCardinal Kim skillfully avoided politicizing religion while consistently affirming the Church’s moral responsibility. He believed that “religion should not be a place of escape from the world, but a source of hope for the world,” and his actions proved this belief. He upheld the view that the Church must stand with the people, not with power. While he rarely clashed directly with the Park regime, he used the moral authority of the Church to push for justice and human rights. His leadership not only reformed the Church in the 1970s but laid the ethical groundwork for Korea’s democratization in the following decades.\n\n\n조용기 趙鏞基David Yonggi Cho \n\n02/14/1936 ~ 09/14/2021\n\n\nPastor David Yonggi Cho’s activities during the 1970s marked a pivotal transformation in both the theology and social practice of the Korean church. During this time, as Yoido Full Gospel Church entered a period of rapid expansion, he systematized Pentecostal pneumatology while placing the care for marginalized populations at the heart of his ministry. On September 23, 1973, Yoido Full Gospel Church dedicated a 10,000-seat main sanctuary and hosted the 10th World Pentecostal Conference in Seoul, rising to global prominence within the Pentecostal movement. At this event, Cho declared, “Through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit... the church shall march on unhindered”.\n\nPastor Cho’s ministry directly confronted the social realities of South Korea’s rapid industrialization and urbanization, which produced significant social instability. Amid political repression and economic disparity, he envisioned the church as a “healing community offering hope to the poor.” His theological framework—expressed through the “Fivefold Gospel” and “Threefold Blessing”—went beyond doctrinal systems to function as a “spiritual and practical faith that simultaneously offers assurance of salvation and life transformation”. Reflecting on the desperation he witnessed, Cho recalled, “They were people in despair. The solution was to give them hope. I preached messages of hope from Genesis to Revelation based on 3 John 1:2. As a result, people were transformed, and those in despair began to smile again”.\n\nThis practical theology was implemented through a structured ministry strategy. In the 1970s, Cho introduced the cell group system, which enabled small community units within the church to provide prayer, counseling, and service—not only to church members but also to those in surrounding communities. Each cell group identified those in need, reported cases to the upper pastoral leadership, and ensured sustained support. Cho emphasized that “care must not be a one-time act, but continued until full restoration is achieved”.\n\nBeyond spiritual care and church growth, Cho stood at the center of Korea’s most contentious theological debates. His Pentecostal theology—which emphasized spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues, healing, and prophecy—was met with strong opposition from Reformed theologians, especially within Presbyterian circles. Park Hyung-ryong, in particular, published criticisms in the Shinhak Jinan journal, asserting that “regeneration and Spirit baptism are one and the same and occur only once.” In response, Cho defended his view through articles in Shinang-gye, stating, “Tongues are a powerful outward sign of Spirit-filled experience,” though he also sought to defuse tensions by clarifying, “I do not say that tongues are Spirit baptism itself”.\n\nTo further clarify and legitimize his theology, Cho published The Holy Spirit in 1971, a work widely regarded as “a compelling guidebook with an expansive interdenominational readership.” This book explained gifts of the Spirit such as tongues, healing, and power in systematic terms and argued that Pentecostal faith did not contradict evangelical orthodoxy. He also cited the 1970 decision of the United Presbyterian Church in the USA to affirm the biblical validity of glossolalia, using this to demonstrate that “Pentecostal pneumatology can be theologically embraced within the evangelical tradition”. Additionally, Cho sought out dialogue with progressive theologians and religious scholars to widen academic understanding of religious experience beyond confessional boundaries.\n\nThus, Pastor Cho’s 1970s ministry was not merely about institutional expansion but redefined the role of the Korean church in both spiritual and social dimensions. He offered a vision of Pentecostal revival that validated spiritual experience while compelling the church to respond to the cries of society’s most vulnerable. His church became a refuge for the urban poor, women, and the disenfranchised, and his theology empowered a new religious imagination that continues to shape global Pentecostalism.\n\n\n 김준곤 金俊坤  Jun Gon Kim\n\n03/2/1925 ~ 09/29/2000\n\n\nRev. Joon Gon Kim's ministry in the 1970s was one of the most comprehensive religious campaigns in modern Korean Christianity, intertwining evangelism, national renewal, and social transformation. Rather than limiting his efforts to preaching the gospel, Kim envisioned a full-scale evangelization of the Korean people—spiritual, cultural, and political—through a theological lens shaped by personal suffering and reformist convictions. His national evangelization movement emerged as a strategic response to the historical and political challenges of postwar Korea, including its authoritarian modernization under President Park Chung-hee.\n\nRev. Kim publicly launched the National Evangelization Movement on December 31, 1970, during a special year-end broadcast on CBS. He had already proposed the idea to President Park Chung-hee, and by February 1970, the movement had begun with state-level approval. As noted, “Rev. Joon Gon Kim initiated the National Believer Movement in February 1970, following his proposal to President Park in 1969.” This marked the beginning of a collaboration—albeit uneasy at times—between evangelical leaders and state power during Korea’s Yushin period.\n\nThe partnership between Kim and the Park regime was a calculated attempt to expand the reach of the gospel across Korean society. He did not shy away from working with political authorities to amplify the evangelical message. The mass revival rally EXPLO '74, which drew hundreds of thousands to Yeouido, Seoul, demonstrated Kim’s willingness to utilize state infrastructure to pursue spiritual goals. However, this alignment also provoked criticism. Observers accused the movement of “blurring the line between the gospel and nationalism,” especially in its use of state language and nationalistic rhetoric. Nonetheless, Kim’s approach reflected a pragmatic theology—one that prioritized the evangelization of the nation over political neutrality. In his own words, “Rather than clinging to political neutrality, the church must engage even unbelievers for the sake of the gospel. We are called to be the light of the world, not to isolate ourselves.”\n\nKim’s sense of mission was deeply rooted in his personal history of suffering. Born in 1925 in Shinan County, Jeolla Province, he grew up in poverty and witnessed multiple family tragedies. “He saw his cousin freeze to death, another sibling die from burns, and another struck dead by a falling tree,” and later, during the Korean War, his father and wife were killed by communist forces. These experiences, rather than crushing him, solidified his commitment to a divine vision: “It was then that I fully gave my life to the Lord and received the vision of national evangelization as my personal mission.” This vision was sharpened during his time in Manchuria in 1944, where, in hiding from Japanese conscription, he encountered Kim In-seok, a holiness pastor with a personal library of over 2,000 volumes. There, Kim combined fasting and study, forming a theology that was both intellectually rigorous and spiritually fervent. He later stated that “evangelization means giving every person a chance to believe in Jesus, discipling believers to become disciple-makers, and allowing the gospel to transform culture, society, and the nation.”\n\nKim’s theological grounding was also shaped by his resistance to liberal theology. Initially enrolled at Chosun Theological Seminary, he left due to its modernist tendencies and transferred to Korea Theological Seminary in Busan, where he studied under Dr. Hyung Ryong Park. Kim became a staunch proponent of Reformed evangelicalism, upholding “the authority of Scripture and the sovereignty of Christ.” This theological foundation later informed the structure of CCC’s national and global missions.\n\nThe 1970s also saw Kim develop two distinctive strategies for realizing his vision: the Holy City Movement (Sungshihwa) and EXPLO '74. The Holy City Movement, launched in Chuncheon in 1972, was inspired by two models: John Calvin’s Geneva and the martyr-evangelist Moon Jun-gyeong. Kim envisioned the church as a \"moral city center\" that would meet both the spiritual and material needs of citizens. He stated, “Chuncheon should become a model city where God’s sovereignty reaches every domain—like Calvin’s Geneva.” Moon’s example of sacrificial ministry among the poor and unchurched deeply shaped Kim’s belief that the church should serve the entire city, not just its members.\n\nThus, Kim’s national evangelization strategy fused rigorous theology, personal tragedy, and a profound vision of national redemption. It sought to turn Korea into a “Jesus nation,” not through coercion, but through discipleship, spiritual renewal, and social transformation. His message was one of total gospelization—a cultural, national, and global campaign in which the gospel of Jesus Christ would reign over every sphere of life.\n\n\n안병무  安炳茂  Byung-mu Ahn\n\n06/23/1922 ~ 10/19/1996\n\n\nAhn Byung-mu emerged in the 1970s as a theological revolutionary who faced the Yushin regime and military dictatorship head-on. In 1972, his short article “Jesus and Minjung” introduced ochlos (ὄχλος) as a theological category, boldly declaring that the minjung are the true historical subject and that Jesus is found among them. He recalled, “I did not see the suffering of the minjung as individual suffering, but as collective. Under the dictatorship, I thought everyone was minjung.”\n\nIn 1975, with the publication of The Liberator Jesus, he made his theology of minjung more explicit, confronting state violence and reclaiming the narrative of Jesus not as a metaphysical savior, but as a historical event of liberation. In 1976, Ahn was arrested for participating in the March 1st Declaration for National Salvation, underscoring the indivisibility of his theology and political praxis.\n\nHis theological praxis was grounded in institutional and intellectual strategy. During this decade, Ahn founded the Korea Theological Study Institute, which served as the base for organizing and expanding minjung theology. It was not simply a research center but a “space that not only led theological discourse in the 1970s and 1980s but also created a unique tradition of Korean academic theology that could be presented globally.”\n\nAhn’s concept of minjung transcended time and place. He regarded the colonized under Japanese rule, postwar rural migrants, and those oppressed under the Yushin regime as all expressions of the same historical subject. As he explained, minjung represented “those who suffer across historical contexts—collectively bearing the burden of history.” The Ahn of the 1970s was not merely a thinker but a prophetic voice—one who bridged faith, resistance, and the suffering people.\n\n  ",
