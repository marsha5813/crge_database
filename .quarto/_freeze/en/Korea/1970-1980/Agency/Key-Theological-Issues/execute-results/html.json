It was not merely a technical exercise in textual translation; it was a theologically and politically charged attempt to build a shared linguistic and spiritual ground between Korean Catholics and Protestants. This monumental endeavor carried the aspirations of theological reconciliation, linguistic renewal, and national unity during a period of political unrest and spiritual ferment.\n\nEmerging in the wake of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and the ecumenical momentum initiated by the World Council of Churches, the Korean project gained institutional form through the establishment of the \"성서공동번역위원회\" (Common Bible Translation Committee) in 1968. This committee was a product of mutual openness: the Catholic Church ceased to label Protestant churches as heretical and began referring to them as \"형제 교회\" (brother churches), while Protestant denominations initiated their own efforts toward dialogue. Their shared vision culminated in the publication of the New Testament in 1971 and the complete Bible, including the Old Testament, in 1977.\n\nThis translation work was led by eminent figures from both traditions, including Fr. Seon Jong-wan on the Catholic side and Rev. Moon Ik-hwan from the Protestant side. Moon’s role was especially pivotal. An Old Testament scholar and Hebrew linguist educated at Princeton Theological Seminary, Moon brought both scholarly rigor and poetic sensitivity to the project. He viewed the translation as more than technical labor—it was a mission to restore beauty and clarity to the Korean Bible. He insisted, \"Shedding classical Chinese and Japanese syntax, and being liberated from Western rigid logic, nurturing the pure simplicity of Korean language—that’s the task of the Bible.\" His vision was to see the Bible not only as theology but as literature—capable of transforming worship, preaching, and national identity.\n\nFr. Seon Jong-wan, likewise, brought deep theological insight to the work, and introduced stylistically bold translations. He rejected the rigid rendering of Genesis 1:1—“태초에” (in the beginning)—and instead coined the neologism “비롯음에” (\"at the birthing\") to convey a more dynamic sense of divine creation rooted in Hebrew syntax. Similarly, he translated “빛이 있으라 하시니 빛이 있었더라” (Let there be light, and there was light) as “빛이 생기어라 하시매 빛이 생기니라” (Let light come into being, and it came into being), emphasizing the generative power of the Word. These translations reflected not just linguistic choices but deep theological commitments to a living, breathing God who moves in history.\n\nThese translation choices, however, sparked considerable controversy. One of the fiercest points of contention was the name of God. Catholic translators adhered to “하느님” (Haneunim), a form consistent with traditional Korean Catholic usage. Protestant communities, especially conservative denominations, rejected this in favor of “하나님” (Hananim), which they saw as doctrinally correct and rooted in their worship traditions. The final Common Bible employed “하느님,” which resulted in its rejection by many Protestant churches.\n\nAnother theological flashpoint was the rendering of the Hebrew tetragrammaton YHWH. Catholics introduced “야훼” (Yahweh), aligning closely with Hebrew scholarship. Protestants, however, were more familiar with the older “여호와” (Jehovah), a term inherited from Chinese Protestant Bibles. Once again, the Common Bible’s adoption of “야훼” created discomfort, as it departed from both liturgical and devotional norms among many Protestant communities.\n\nThe controversy extended into Christological and sacramental terminology. Protestants raised concerns that some phrasing in the translation favored Catholic theology—particularly on issues such as the Eucharist, Mary’s role in salvation history, and the nature of grace. Critics argued that the Common Bible leaned too close to Catholic positions on certain doctrinal issues, thus compromising what they saw as necessary theological clarity.\n\nIn terms of translation philosophy, Catholics leaned toward a dynamic equivalence model, seeking to reproduce meaning and affect rather than a word-for-word rendering. Protestants generally favored formal equivalence, seeking fidelity to the original syntax and structure. This difference in hermeneutical posture was vividly seen in how texts like Genesis 1:1 were handled. Moon Ik-hwan passionately believed that scripture should “liberate us from the clunky remnants of classical and colonial language, and bring us into living Korean.” This vision was not universally accepted and indeed was met with resistance from traditions that feared such literary freedom might weaken theological integrity.\n\nDespite—or perhaps because of—these tensions, the Common Bible stands as a unique testimony to what ecumenical cooperation can achieve and where its limits lie. Even its partial rejection speaks volumes about the identities it sought to reconcile. The project was simultaneously a theological union and a catalyst for confessional retrenchment. As one writer observed, “This was the Bible that tried to be both Catholic and Protestant—and in doing so became a symbol of both hope and hesitation.” To further illustrate how the Common Bible addressed these disputed terms, the following table compares key theological expressions and how they were resolved:\n\n\nTable 7. \n\n\n| Disputed Element | Catholic Position | Protestant Position | Final Common Bible Resolution |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| God's Name ('하느님' vs '하나님') | ‘하느님’ (Haneunim) reflects older Korean Catholic usage, emphasizing divine transcendence | ‘하나님’ (Hananim) aligns with Protestant tradition | Used ‘하느님’ throughout, causing some Protestant rejection |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| YHWH / Tetragrammaton | Preferred ‘야훼’ (Yahweh) to restore the original name of God from Hebrew | Preferred ‘여호와’ (Jehovah) as used historically | Adopted ‘야훼’, aligning with Hebrew scholarly conventions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Translation Style | Dynamic equivalence; poetic and natural Korean phrasing | More literal, word-for-word translation | Favored dynamic approach, led by Seon Jong-wan and Moon Ik-hwan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Christological Terms | Emphasized sacramental theology, sometimes including Eucharistic nuances | Preferred language reflecting sola fide theology | Carefully neutralized terms, avoiding overt doctrinal bias |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sacramental Expressions | Use of '성찬례' for Eucharist | Use of '성찬식' for Lord's Supper | Minimized sacramental terms; left to contextual interpretation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mary and Saints | Greater emphasis on Marian passages (Luke 1:28, etc.) | Reserved, non-venerational language | Adopted balanced renderings with literal Greek fidelity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nControversies in the Formation of Minjung Theology\n\n\nA major theological controversy during the formation of minjung theology was the divergence over how to interpret the essence of the Gospel proclamation. In traditional Christian theology, the central framework of the New Testament’s message is known as kerygma, a Greek word meaning “proclamation.” In biblical usage, kerygma refers to the public declaration of the core message of salvation—namely, that Jesus Christ died and rose again, and that those who believe in him will be saved. This concept, rooted in the apostolic preaching of Acts, frames salvation history through the lens of Christ's divine sonship and redemptive death and resurrection. However, minjung theologians strongly critiqued this emphasis on kerygma for abstracting Jesus from his historical context and detaching him from the lived experiences of the oppressed people.\n\nAhn Byung-mu argued that “the theologization of the kerygma transformed the murder of Jesus into a mere death, and replaced his political resistance with religious sacrifice”. For Ahn, the cross should not be understood as a mystical redemptive symbol, but as the result of Jesus’s solidarity with the oppressed and his resistance to unjust power. Thus, the Gospel is not only a message of spiritual salvation but a declaration that demands transformation in the midst of suffering and oppression. While not outright rejecting kerygma, minjung theology contended that “abstract proclamations alone are insufficient without the historical grounding of the people's reality”.\n\nThis approach sparked significant backlash within the Korean church. Conservative Protestant leaders accused minjung theology of “undermining doctrinal orthodoxy and politicizing the Gospel,” labeling it heretical. The controversy intensified when minjung theologians became involved in urban industrial mission work, which led to accusations of communist sympathies. Figures such as Ahn Byung-mu and Suh Nam-dong were even subject to disciplinary actions, including exclusion from theological faculties and threats of excommunication. These events demonstrate that minjung theology was not merely a theological discourse, but a profound confrontation with institutional religion, political authority, and the very meaning of faith.\n\nThe question of whether minjung theology prioritized political resistance over divine communion led to another persistent critique: the supposed absence of spirituality. Critics charged that minjung theology was overly preoccupied with structural injustice and lacked inner piety or mystical depth. In response, theologian Ryu Jang-hyun argued that minjung theology did not arise from monasteries but from “the bodily spirituality experienced in sites of suffering,” which he defined as a “spiritual encounter with God in the context of praxis”. He claimed, “the work of the Holy Spirit is always manifested through the event of the liberation of the minjung”—thus framing liberation not merely as a political event, but as a pneumatological act of salvation.\n\nEven within the movement, internal critiques emerged. One unresolved issue was the ambiguity of the term minjung itself. Who exactly qualifies as the minjung? Are intellectuals part of the minjung? These questions revealed a tension between theoretical constructs and lived realities. Some social theorists criticized the movement’s tendency to “abstract and objectify the people,” suggesting that minjung were often spoken about, but rarely empowered to speak for themselves.\n\nAnother major controversy emerged when Kim Chi-ha—once a central literary and intellectual figure in the minjung movement—shifted toward a life-centered cosmology in the 1980s. Influenced by Tonghak thought and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Kim proposed a cosmic spirituality that redefined minjung through an ecological and universal lens. This move was sharply criticized by progressives, some of whom accused him of “betraying the minjung cause.” Cultural critic Cho Jeong-hwan, however, argued that Kim's life philosophy was “not a withdrawal from history but a proposal for a new ethical paradigm”. While acknowledging\n\nKim’s contradictions, Cho asserted that his cosmic vision could still serve as “an alternative ethics of the universe that seeks to transcend materialist leftist paradigms”. These complex and often painful debates show that minjung theology emerged not only from theological speculation but from concrete historical experiences. It challenged theological, political, and cultural institutions, and in doing so, redefined the mission of theology as public, contextual, and embodied in the life of the people.\n\n\nPneumatological Conflicts and the Rise of the Yoido Full Gospel Church\n\n\nThe debates surrounding pneumatology and charismatic theology that unfolded across the 1970s and 1980s in South Korea were far more than theological disagreements or denominational distinctions. At the center of the storm stood Pastor David Yonggi Cho and the Yoido Full Gospel Church, whose Pentecostal pneumatology offered an experiential and empowering alternative to the traditional doctrines of mainline denominations. By presenting Spirit baptism as a post-conversion event and identifying glossolalia (speaking in tongues) as its clear, external sign, Cho’s theology stood in stark contrast to the Reformed traditions of Korean Presbyterianism, which understood Spirit baptism as synonymous with regeneration and denied the continuation of apostolic gifts such as healing and prophecy.\n\nAs one scholar notes, “Yonggi Cho’s conviction about a Spirit baptism that is distinct from conversion and evidenced by speaking in tongues starkly diverged from the pneumatology of existing denominations.” This theological divergence was not merely a matter of doctrine but was perceived by the theological establishment as a threat to the ecclesial identity and doctrinal orthodoxy of the Korean Protestant church. Figures like Dr. Hyung-Ryong Park of the Presbyterian General Assembly Seminary led the charge in journals such as Shinhak Jinan, critiquing Cho’s theology as unbiblical and misleading.\n\nThe widespread acceptance of Cho’s pneumatology, however, cannot be explained without reference to the socioeconomic upheavals of South Korea during this period. As rapid urbanization, industrialization, rural displacement, and political repression destabilized the social order, Cho’s message of Spirit-empowered healing, blessing, and personal transformation met the existential needs of the Korean people. The practice of speaking in tongues was not merely a doctrinal sign but a form of catharsis and spiritual empowerment for those living at the margins. “The practices of prayer mountain retreats, fasting, healing services, and exorcisms were deeply resonant with the religious sentiment of the Korean masses, and tongues functioned as a sacred language of grace.”\n\nThis theological and practical resonance resulted in explosive church growth. Within just a few decades, the Yoido Full Gospel Church became not only the largest church in Korea but also the largest church in the world. Testimonies of Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues flooded the pages of Shinangye (The Gospel World), a magazine closely associated with the movement. Stories like “I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues within five days” became a recurring feature. However, as criticism mounted, particularly in the 1970s, such testimonies gave way to more theological articles on the benefits and meaning of tongues by theologians like Park Jung-geun.\n\nIn response to criticism, Cho clarified that “speaking in tongues is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit itself... it is rather a powerful external sign of Spirit-filled experience, biblically confirmed.” Despite these clarifications, critics accused Cho’s theology of aligning too closely with shamanistic mysticism and prosperity theology. In 1983, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (Tonghap) launched an official investigation into the beliefs and theology of Yonggi Cho and the Yoido Full Gospel Church, questioning his emphasis on tongues, healing, and spiritual experiences.\n\nDespite criticisms, Cho’s pneumatology proved effective in addressing the psychological and social needs of South Koreans during a time of massive upheaval. The theology of Spirit baptism, charismatic gifts, and divine blessing did not merely promise eschatological salvation but offered tangible transformation in the here and now. His ability to ritualize these experiences in structured church life—through home cell groups, healing services, and prayer mountains—enabled the church to function as both spiritual sanctuary and psychosocial support network. In this sense, “Pentecostalism functioned as practical religion and psychosocial support.”\n\n\nTable 8.

This issue was not merely about ecclesiastical policy but about biblical interpretation, theological identity, and how the Korean church would engage with both its Reformed tradition and the global Christian community. The contrasting responses of Tonghap and Hapdong—two major branches of Korean Presbyterianism formed after the 1959 schism—offered a vivid picture of the growing divergence between progressive and conservative currents within Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nTonghap and Hapdong: Distinct Ecclesial Orientations\n\nTo fully understand their differing positions on women’s ordination, it is crucial to examine the broader theological and institutional orientations of the Tonghap and Hapdong denominations. While both emerged from a shared Presbyterian heritage and adhere to the Westminster Confession of Faith, their trajectories since division have diverged dramatically.\n\n\nTonghap: Ecumenical, Theologically Progressive, and Globally Engaged\n\nTonghap (The Presbyterian Church of Korea) represents the more ecumenical and theologically progressive wing of Korean Presbyterianism. Actively engaged in the World Council of Churches (WCC), Tonghap aligns itself with mainline Protestant denominations worldwide and has shown receptiveness to contemporary theological currents such as contextual theology, gender equality, and social justice.\n\n\nTonghap emphasizes:\n\nParticipation in global Christian networks and cooperation with denominations such as the PCUSA and GKN.\n\nFlexibility in biblical interpretation, including openness to historical-critical methods.\n\nLay leadership, inclusive ministry models, and theological reflection that engages cultural change.\n\nIn this environment, the ordination of women was framed not only as a theological decision but as an issue of mission, justice, and ecclesial credibility in the modern world.\n\nHapdong: Confessionalist, Doctrinally Conservative, and Biblically Literalist\n\nBy contrast, Hapdong (The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) stands as the confessionally conservative and doctrinally rigid branch. It affirms biblical inerrancy, maintains a literal reading of Scripture, and adheres to the regulative principle of worship. Hapdong has been deeply critical of the WCC and other ecumenical organizations, which it views as compromising Reformed orthodoxy.\n\nHapdong’s identity is marked by:\n\nStrict observance of the Westminster standards in unaltered form.\n\nDeep concern for maintaining the gendered hierarchy established in Scripture.\n\nCentralized theological authority and a legacy shaped by theologians such as Park Hyung-Ryong and Seo Chul-Won.\n\nIn this context, the ordination of women was viewed not as a theological innovation but as a threat to the very foundations of church order and biblical authority.\n\n\nHapdong: Confessionalist, Doctrinally Conservative, and Biblically Literalist\n\nBy contrast, Hapdong (The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) stands as the confessionally conservative and doctrinally rigid branch.

Although motions to adopt women elders were repeatedly defeated, the increasing number of affirmative votes revealed a gradual change in denominational sentiment.\n\nKey General Assembly Trends:\n\n58th General Assembly (1973): Motion rejected (95 in favor, 162 opposed).\n\n59th Assembly (1974): Rejected (120:183).\n\n60th Assembly (1975): Rejected (126:180).\n\n61st Assembly (1976): Rejected (133:173).\n\n62nd Assembly (1977): Narrowly rejected (143:157).\n\nThe consistent increase in support indicated a theological and generational shift underway within the denomination\n\nCore Arguments in the Motions:\n\n“Over two-thirds of the church membership consists of women. Their inclusion in ordained ministry is essential for mission effectiveness.”\n\n“Women’s ordination reflects the current global trend of gender equality. The church cannot be seen as ignoring women’s rights.”\n\n“As global partner churches allow women’s ordination, our women are disadvantaged in international ecumenical relations.”\n\nThese arguments were largely contextual and missional, grounded in concerns over justice, parity, and the church’s public witness.\n\n\nHapdong: Rejection Rooted in Scripture and Ecclesial Tradition\n\nHapdong, meanwhile, never formally entertained motions for women’s ordination. Instead, theological treatises and institutional publications served as the primary mode of opposition. By the mid-1990s, the denomination had consolidated its position through articles in Shinhak Jinam (1996, 1997) and the 83rd General Assembly (1998), which officially reaffirmed the prohibition[5†source].\n\nScriptural Grounds for Opposition:\n\n1 Timothy 2:11–15 – “Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.” Interpreted as forbidding women from teaching or exercising authority in the church.\n\n1 Corinthians 11:2–10 – The headship order of creation.\n\n1 Corinthians 14:34–35 – “Women should remain silent in the churches.”\n\n1 Timothy 3:1–7 / Titus 1:5–6 – Qualifications for elders described in male-exclusive terms.\n\nPark Hyung-Ryong maintained:\n\n“The legal authority to teach and rule the entire church belongs exclusively to men; this is the clear meaning of Scripture and the long-held conviction of the universal church.”\n\nWayne Grudem added:\n\n“The New Testament only records the ordination of men, which reflects the divine principle that public church office is given to males alone.”\n\nThis complementarian theology stood at the core of Hapdong's ecclesial structure and identity.\n\n\nTable 9.  Comparison Table\n\n| Category | Tonghap | Hapdong |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stance | Gradual acceptance | Firm theological opposition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Assembly Motions | 1973–1977 motions for women elders failed but gained support | No formal motions; issue viewed as doctrinally closed |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Theological Basis | Justice, equality, and contextual theology | Literal interpretation, ecclesial order, biblical inerrancy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Representative Theologians | Kim Jae-Jun, Han Kyung-Jik, Kang Won-Ryong | Park Hyung-Ryong, Seo Chul-Won, Wayne Grudem |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ecumenical Position | Active in WCC; aligned with PCUSA, Dutch GKN | Opposed to WCC; aligned with evangelical bodies like CBMW |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Women’s Ministry | Progressed to ordaining women pastors (1994) | Permitted women evangelists, not preachers or elders |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Core Argument | \"Expanding women's roles is a missional necessity.\" | \"Scripture prohibits women from teaching and ruling.\" |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThe 1970s women’s ordination debate reveals far more than differences over gender roles. It uncovers fundamentally divergent theological ecosystems: Tonghap's global, contextual, and mission-driven orientation versus Hapdong’s confessionalist, biblicist, and ecclesially protective posture. For Tonghap, the issue evolved from inclusion to transformation. For Hapdong, it was always about preservation—of Scripture, order, and tradition. In the end, women’s ordination became a litmus test for each denomination’s identity: a marker of their theological vision, cultural openness, and interpretive method. These tensions, born in the 1970s, continue to define the contours of Korean Presbyterianism to this day.\n\n\nIndigenization Theology and Theological Conflict\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a transitional era in Korean theology, as indigenization theology shifted from theological experimentation to a theology rooted in social engagement. During this period, Korean theologians moved beyond merely adapting the gospel to Korean culture and began reconstructing theology within the lived realities of the Korean people and their history. In this process, fierce theological debates unfolded over how to redefine the relationships among gospel, church, and culture.\n\nThis theological transformation was grounded in concerns raised in the 1960s. In 1959, Yoo Dong-sik published the article “Tao and Logos”, where he asserted that “the gospel must be transmitted through culture and language, and must be reinterpreted through Korean philosophical consciousness”. Similarly, Yoon Sung-bum explored how Christian truth could take root within the spiritual and philosophical frameworks of the Korean people.\n\nWhile these early efforts remained limited to individual scholarly attempts, the 1970s witnessed their expansion into a broader theological movement. The progressive camp—represented by NCCK, KSCF, and Hanshin University—advocated for a theology that resonated with the lived experiences and emotional sensibilities of the Korean people. Theologians such as Suh Nam-dong, Ahn Byung-mu, and Kim Yong-bok argued that indigenization theology must not merely localize the gospel but must incorporate the historical suffering and liberation of the Korean minjung (masses) as its core. Kim Yong-bok defined this as “a theology lived out with the minjung,” emphasizing that “the gospel must be expressed anew through the language and emotions of the people”.\n\nIn contrast, conservative theologians emphasized the transculturality of the Bible, warning that indigenization efforts could undermine the essential nature of Christianity. They maintained that the gospel represents a universally valid truth that transcends all cultures and historical contexts. Consequently, any attempt to integrate elements from Korean traditional religions or indigenous symbols was viewed as a potential threat of syncretism.\n\nThe debates were not confined to abstract theory but were reflected in liturgical practice and theological education. Some seminaries—including Seoul Presbyterian Seminary, Methodist Theological Seminary, and Hanshin University—experimented with Koreanized worship services, incorporating traditional elements such as hanbok attire, pansori preaching, folk hymnody, and even symbolic figures like Dangun or shamanistic imagery. These experiments sparked controversy, with some denominational authorities denouncing them as heretical acts.\n\nMeanwhile, institutional and academic support for indigenization theology was expanding rapidly. The establishment of the Christian Institute for the Study of Korean Culture in 1973 and the Korea Theological Study Institute in 1977 provided structural and scholarly foundations for the movement. Kim Yong-bok’s book The Minjung and Indigenization Theology (1980) articulated the movement’s central direction. He declared, “Indigenization theology is not about surrendering to tradition, but about revitalizing the gospel,” and insisted that theology grounded in solidarity with the minjung represented the authentic path for Korean Christianity.\n\nThis momentum in the 1970s paved the way for further developments in the 1980s, where indigenization theology evolved into a fully institutionalized and practice-oriented minjung theology. Ahn Byung-mu defined minjung theology as “a theology where the Korean church encounters the minjung, based on the recognition that Jesus himself was part of the minjung,” asserting that gospel indigenization must begin from the concrete realities of the oppressed. During the 1980s, indigenization was no longer about translating Christian concepts into Korean symbols, but rather became a theology of liberation addressing the structures of political oppression and economic injustice.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1970s served as a theological bridge between the philosophical inquiries of the 1960s and the praxis-based theology of the 1980s. It was a pivotal decade in which nationalism, faith, liberation, and gospel converged in complex ways. In the broader arc of Korean theological history, the movement for indigenization expanded far beyond questions of “Koreanization” to encompass a full-scale reinterpretation and rearticulation of the Christian gospel within its Korean context.\n\n\nRevisiting the Korean Christian Federation’s Alleged Application to the World Council of Churches: Myth, Miscommunication, and Cold War Echoes in South Korean Protestantism\n\n\nThe issue of the Korean Christian Federation's (KCF) application for membership in the World Council of Churches (WCC) is a symbolic episode that reveals how religious exchanges can acquire political overtones in the Cold War context between North and South Korea. The reality of the event and the reaction of the South Korean Christian community unfolded amid longstanding distortions and misunderstandings, the truth of which has only recently come to light through scholarly inquiry.\n\nThe incident began in February 1974 when two diplomats from the North Korean mission in Geneva visited the WCC headquarters and delivered two letters under the name of the KCF. These letters, rather than expressing a desire to join the WCC, called for the Council’s support of the South Korean church’s pro-democracy movement and condemned the human rights abuses of the Park Chung-hee regime. In particular, the letter stated, \"We hope you will deeply understand our letter and raise your voice against the fascist atrocities committed by the South Korean authorities, and just as you supported our people's struggle for national reunification in the past, we hope you will actively support the righteous struggle of the people, including South Korean religious believers\"—demonstrating that the letter was far more political than religious in nature.\n\nAt the time, this letter was widely misinterpreted as a formal application for WCC membership. Two factors contributed to this misunderstanding. First, one of the North Korean diplomats reportedly said, \"I am not a Christian, but I want to join the WCC,\" requesting information about the organization. Second, South Korean church leaders—such as Rev. Yoo Ho-joon of the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) and Rev. Kim Kwan-seok, General Secretary of the National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC)—relayed this information imprecisely to domestic religious and media circles. Rev. Kim Kwan-seok even held a press conference upon his return, claiming, \"The North fabricated a Christian organization called the Korean Christian Federation that doesn't even exist and tried to apply for WCC membership, but was rejected\". This statement stoked strong opposition within the South Korean Christian community and quickly established the WCC application claim as a fact.\n\nHowever, subsequent archival research by Professor Kim Heung-soo of Mokwon University has clearly shown otherwise. After meticulously examining the WCC archives, he concluded, “It was not a membership application, but a letter requesting WCC support for the pro-democracy movement in South Korea.” Kim noted that he searched the WCC’s underground vaults for this so-called application form but never found it. Instead, the evidence indicated that the North Korean diplomats had simply taken documents like the WCC’s charter, lists of member churches and publications—materials more indicative of information gathering than of any formal application. In short, there was no written application, and the oral comment was grossly exaggerated and miscommunicated as a full-fledged attempt at WCC membership.\n\nThis misunderstanding sparked significant controversy within the South Korean Christian community. The WCC had already been regarded with suspicion by certain conservative Protestant groups in Korea, who viewed it as a pro-communist organization. This perception stemmed from events during the Korean War, when the WCC supported a ceasefire, earning the ire of then-President Syngman Rhee and fueling conspiracy theories promoted by right-wing Christian circles aligned with the American ICCC (International Council of Christian Churches). The claim that the WCC had accepted a membership bid from North Korea further intensified this animosity, and the misbelief persisted well into the 1990s.\n\nEventually, the truth was clarified through academic research: there was no actual application. Instead, the KCF's contact with the WCC was politically motivated, aimed at denouncing South Korea's dictatorship, and was misrepresented due to the tense atmosphere of the Cold War and ideological divides. Professor Kim summarized the matter unequivocally: \"The claim that the KCF applied for WCC membership is historically false.\"*⁷\n\nThis episode carries dual significance for the South Korean church. First, it serves as a case study of how truth can be distorted and weaponized when religious and political interpretations collide. Second, it highlights how misunderstandings about the WCC have hindered South Korea's engagement in global ecumenical movements. As Professor Kim stated, *“The Cold War mentality and narrow theology of the Korean church have produced a distorted view of the WCC.” His findings underscore the need for a more reflective and informed approach to religious diplomacy and church history.
