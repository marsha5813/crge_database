As political oppression intensified across all sectors of society, Christianity—particularly its progressive factions—was thrust into direct confrontation with the state. These Christian actors did not merely react; they publicly declared that faith could not be separated from justice, freedom, and resistance to tyranny.\n\nThis conviction found expression in the 1973 \"Declaration of Korean Christians\" and the 1974 \"Theological Statement of Korean Christians.\" These documents articulated the idea that Christian faith necessitated a commitment to human dignity and justice, and denounced the violence and injustice perpetrated by state power. The government responded with arrests, surveillance, and harassment of the signatories and affiliated groups, such as the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), pastors trained at Hanshin Seminary, and leaders in the Urban Industrial Mission. Despite state repression, the progressive Christian movement forged a new theological paradigm known as Minjung Theology. Pioneered by figures like Suh Nam-dong, Ahn Byung-mu, and Kim Yong-bok, this theology centered on the lived realities of the oppressed and insisted that Christ was present in the suffering of the people.\n\nSocial hostility also manifested internally within the Christian community. Conservative factions denounced this socially engaged theology as a deviation from the gospel. They feared that Christian participation in politics would dilute the transcultural message of scripture. Consequently, doctrinal schisms intensified, leading to renewed conflict within major denominations such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Tonghap and Hapdong) and the Methodist Church. Controversies over women’s ordination, inculturation worship, and theological education became flashpoints in this struggle.\n\nNevertheless, in the face of both state and internal pressures, progressive Christians persisted in their integration efforts. The NCCK attempted interdenominational solidarity, while groups like the Korean Church Women United, the Urban Industrial Mission, and the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF) developed practical ministries aligned with justice and service. As one statement encapsulated the ethos of the time:\n\n“The church is not a safe haven from the world, but a community called into the world.”\n\n\nNorth Korea: Reorganization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and the Rise of Socialist Christianity\n\nWhile Christianity in the South was contesting dictatorship, in North Korea it was undergoing a transformation into a state-managed religious apparatus. The 1972 Socialist Constitution of North Korea formally declared freedom of religion, but with a significant caveat: this freedom was only protected \"as long as it does not disrupt social order\". This stipulation effectively subordinated all religious practice to the authority of the Workers’ Party.\n\nThe centerpiece of North Korea’s religious strategy was the reorganization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF). Far from being an autonomous religious body, the KCF became a political tool to facilitate international diplomacy. Through efforts such as applying for membership in the World Council of Churches (WCC), the KCF sought to project an image of religious tolerance to the outside world. However, critics noted that this was merely a diplomatic ploy. As Kim Heung-soo argued, “The activities of the KCF have nothing to do with theological autonomy and merely serve to express state ideology in religious language.”\n\nInternally, the regime recast Christianity as compatible with Juche ideology. Core Christian principles such as \"love\" were reinterpreted as loyalty to the leader and sacrifice for the nation. Worship services were co-opted into political events, and all religious expression was subject to surveillance.\n\nThis tightly controlled integration meant that public Christianity existed only within state-defined parameters, while theological education, independent preaching, and free association were prohibited. Despite these restrictions, some sources suggest that underground churches persisted during the 1970s, indicating a residual spiritual yearning among the North Korean population. Official publications described Christianity not as a superstition that dulled the masses, but rather as an ethical system repurposed to serve socialist society.\n\n ",
