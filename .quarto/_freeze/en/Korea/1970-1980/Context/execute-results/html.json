Rather than through explicit legal codes, control was exercised indirectly—through administrative guidelines, state-facilitated rituals, military chaplaincy systems, and selective policy incentives. The Protestant churches, especially conservative denominations, became key partners of the regime. The Presidential Prayer Breakfast, modeled after the American version, became a symbolic bridge connecting Christianity with the state. “Before the Yushin constitutional reform, Park Chung Hee made four agreements with Kim Joon-gon. One was that the government would fully support the total Christianization of the military, led by pro-government churches and missions”.\n\nTable 1. Comparison: Explicit vs. Implicit Religious Control\n\n| Category | Explicit Control (Colonial Era) | Implicit Control (1970s) | Main Target | Policy Goal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Policy Means | Temple Ordinance (1911), Propagation Rules (1920) | Prayer breakfasts, military chaplaincy, religious councils | Buddhism and all religions | Social order, imperial integration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Key Features | Direct legal regulations without constitutional limits | Administrative and political influence within legal boundaries | Mainstream Protestantism favored | Legitimizing regime, social control |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nRather than direct legal regulation, religious policy operated through administrative guidelines, educational policies, political rituals, military chaplaincy, and selective support of religious events. In 1973, the government even attempted to revise the Social Organization Registration Act, prompting the establishment of a “Religious Affairs Council.” According to contemporary accounts, “Religious groups unanimously opposed this bill on the grounds that it violated religious freedom, and Catholics, Buddhists, and Confucians alike voiced strong resistance”.\n\n\nTable 2. Key Instruments of Religious Policy\n\n| Type | Example | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Administrative Guidelines | Religious site registration, budget reporting, school licensing | Managing institutional religious influence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Ceremonies | Presidential prayer breakfasts, National Assembly religious events | Political legitimization through religion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Educational Policy | High school equalization policy, loss of school autonomy | Limiting religious influence through education |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget and State Support | Buddha’s Birthday public holiday, military chaplaincy | Balancing religious representation, reducing grievances |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Legal Framework | Private School Act, Basic Education Law | Balancing autonomy and public accountability |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nReligious Responses and Impact\n\n\nProtestantism\n\nProtestant churches experienced dramatic expansion, backed by state support, media coverage, and alignment with anti-communist ideology. Large-scale mass baptisms, such as 26 combined ceremonies reaching over 120,000 soldiers, symbolized the success of the church-state alliance. But this alliance came at a cost: the adoption of material growth, size, and success as the ultimate religious values. This so-called “theology of growth” imported from American church marketing principles was infused with capitalist logic. “Churches became obsessed with growth and efficiency, mimicking the mobilization model of Park Chung Hee’s developmental dictatorship”. This was further legitimized through “Threefold Salvation” (salvation of spirit, health, and finances), as preached by Cho Yong-gi, turning the church into “a provider of material blessing and economic upward mobility”. Rather than transcending the material, Korean Protestantism in the 1970s internalized materialism and nationalism, transforming itself into a “religion of materialism.” “Having replaced transcendence with measurable growth, Korean Protestantism effectively became ‘Church-ism’ rather than Christianity”.\n\nConservative leaders idolized church growth as both a spiritual and national solution. Han Kyung-jik declared that “when most of the people convert to Christianity through evangelism, political, economic, and cultural transformation will follow”. But this church-centric ideology functioned as a religious mirror of state authoritarianism, promoting internal hierarchies and suppressing dissent. Strict tithing, Sunday laws, patriarchal clergy structures, and doctrinal exclusivism characterized this era. Church was no longer a community of faith but “an institution of power” modeled after both capitalist competition and Confucian hierarchy.\n\n\nBuddhism\n\nBuddhism faced institutional disadvantages regarding public holidays, access to the military chaplaincy, and internal autonomy. Buddha’s Birthday was only designated as a national holiday in 1975. “On April 23, 1974, 11 Buddhist sects submitted a formal petition to the President and Cabinet members, requesting that Buddha’s Birthday be declared a public holiday”. Yet internal divisions and power struggles within the Jogye Order provided an opening for government interference, culminating in the October 27 Incident of 1980, when the state raided major temples under the pretext of reform. “While reform may have been necessary, such efforts should have originated from within Buddhism itself; instead, state intervention led to renewed divisions and chaos”.\n\nCatholicism\n\nInitially neutral, the Catholic Church took a more confrontational stance in the mid-1970s, particularly after the formation of the Justice and Peace Priests' Association in 1974. Catholic clergy began participating in democratization and human rights campaigns. “By the late 1970s, the Catholic Church had developed a theology of social engagement and emerged at the forefront of anti-Yushin activism”.\n\nWon Buddhism and Other Minority Religions\n\nIn 1975, Won Buddhism submitted a request to participate in the military chaplaincy program, but it was denied. Only in 2007 was formal participation granted. The Unification Church, meanwhile, received informal protection and support from the regime and was strategically utilized for diplomatic and propaganda purposes. “Korea’s religious policy was fundamentally a dual system—favoring pro-government religions with privileges while marginalizing those that criticized the regime”.\n\n\nTable 3. Summary of Religious Policy Changes\n\n| Period | Policy Characteristics | Key Policies/Events | Impact |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese Colonial Rule | Coercive, colonial control | Temple Ordinance, Propagation Rules | Loss of autonomy, attempt to nationalize religion |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1945–1960 | Separation of church and state, religious freedom | Abolition of colonial religious structures | Increased possibility of religious pluralism |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960–1970 | Beginning of policy-based control | Middle school equalization, reduced autonomy of religious schools | Weakened political role of religions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970–1980 | Intensified implicit control and political use | Prayer breakfasts, military chaplaincy, religious councils, Buddha’s Birthday as public holiday | Protestant-regime alliance; Buddhist/Catholic gradual resistance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThe Intensification of the Supreme Leader System and the Transformation of Religious Policy in North Korea\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a pivotal moment in North Korean political and religious history, characterized by the formal institutionalization of the Suryŏng (Supreme Leader) system and a gradual shift in the regime's religious policies. While the external structure of religious persecution remained largely intact, nuanced changes in the official treatment of religion—particularly Christianity—began to emerge as the state sought ideological legitimacy and international engagement.\n\nThe proclamation of the 1972 Socialist Constitution formalized the centralization of power under Kim Il-sung and codified the Juche ideology as the core political doctrine of the state. This consolidation of power was further reinforced by the establishment of the presidency, making Kim Il-sung the supreme source of law and ideology. Within this emerging hegemonic system, religion was redefined not only as an ideological threat but also as a potentially manageable tool for national unity and international diplomacy. As Seong Lim Noh argues, “religious policies are therefore considered as a form of implicit cultural policy—a political strategy to stabilize the regime through cultural management”​.\n\nThis new phase in religious governance was neither a full liberalization nor a mere continuation of anti-religious campaigns. Rather, it represented a strategic recalibration. As Jae-Chun Won outlines, prior to 1972, North Korea had implemented a four-phase model of religious suppression, culminating in the “Era of Juche” from 1972 onward, during which persecution became more systematic and ideological rather than overtly violent​. While the anti-religious rhetoric persisted—Christianity continued to be depicted as an ideological weapon of imperialism—the state simultaneously pursued a controlled revival of religious institutions to serve the regime’s foreign policy objectives.\n\nThe revival of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1972 exemplifies this dual strategy. Jooseop Keum emphasizes that this revival was not a return to ecclesiastical autonomy but rather a means of creating a “state-church” model that operated within the boundaries of Juche-based socialism​. Religious institutions such as the KCF were allowed to function as long as they aligned with state goals, especially those pertaining to reunification rhetoric and international recognition.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the 1972 Constitution (Article 54) introduced language protecting “freedom to believe or not believe in religion.” However, as Philo Kim points out, this was not a genuine concession of rights but rather a strategic ambiguity designed to present a façade of tolerance to the international community while maintaining strict control over religious expression​.\n\nThe changes were particularly evident in the regime’s portrayal of Christianity in cultural productions. Anti-Christian films such as The Sky Beyond the Frontline (1974) and The Spirit Shrine (1978) shifted the focus from atheistic denunciation to more nuanced portrayals of religion as a relic of feudalism and superstition​. This reflected an ideological shift from overt eradication to cultural containment, as the state no longer sought to simply destroy religion but to absorb and neutralize it through Juche-aligned reinterpretation.\n\nIn Gramscian terms, the DPRK’s strategy can be seen as an attempt to integrate civil society (religion) into the hegemonic bloc of the state. As Noh argues, this integration was not merely symbolic but involved a concrete reconfiguration of national ideology to include a form of \"domesticated Protestantism\" that could serve the regime’s diplomatic and unification agendas.\n\nThe transformation in religious policy was thus inseparable from the broader shift toward the Suryŏng system and the codification of Juche as state orthodoxy. It demonstrated the regime’s sophisticated use of religion not only as an internal control mechanism but also as a soft power tool for international legitimation.\n\n\nInter-Korean Unification Policies and Religious Roles: Official Dialogue Begins and Symbolic Shifts\n\nIn 1972, both governments signed the July 4 Joint Statement, affirming the principles of autonomy, peace, and national unity. Although largely symbolic, this was the first formal recognition of each other’s existence. In practice, South Korea intensified internal repression under the Yushin system, while still publicly endorsing peaceful reunification.\n\nChurches in the South remained divided. While some progressive voices began advocating for inter-Korean dialogue, many conservative churches still rejected North Korean churches as illegitimate. In the North, Kim Il-sung's proposal for a Democratic Federal Republic of Koryŏ in 1980 signaled a more pragmatic shift toward coexistence. Religious institutions like the Korean Christian Federation began engaging in international religious diplomacy. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nSouth Korea: Repression of Anti-Yushin Christian Movements and the Church’s Efforts to Integrate with Society\n\nThe 1972 establishment of the Yushin Constitution by President Park Chung Hee marked the beginning of a de facto dictatorship in South Korea. As political oppression intensified across all sectors of society, Christianity—particularly its progressive factions—was thrust into direct confrontation with the state. These Christian actors did not merely react; they publicly declared that faith could not be separated from justice, freedom, and resistance to tyranny.\n\nThis conviction found expression in the 1973 \"Declaration of Korean Christians\" and the 1974 \"Theological Statement of Korean Christians.\" These documents articulated the idea that Christian faith necessitated a commitment to human dignity and justice, and denounced the violence and injustice perpetrated by state power. The government responded with arrests, surveillance, and harassment of the signatories and affiliated groups, such as the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), pastors trained at Hanshin Seminary, and leaders in the Urban Industrial Mission. Despite state repression, the progressive Christian movement forged a new theological paradigm known as Minjung Theology. Pioneered by figures like Suh Nam-dong, Ahn Byung-mu, and Kim Yong-bok, this theology centered on the lived realities of the oppressed and insisted that Christ was present in the suffering of the people.\n\nSocial hostility also manifested internally within the Christian community. Conservative factions denounced this socially engaged theology as a deviation from the gospel. They feared that Christian participation in politics would dilute the transcultural message of scripture. Consequently, doctrinal schisms intensified, leading to renewed conflict within major denominations such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Tonghap and Hapdong) and the Methodist Church. Controversies over women’s ordination, inculturation worship, and theological education became flashpoints in this struggle.\n\nNevertheless, in the face of both state and internal pressures, progressive Christians persisted in their integration efforts. The NCCK attempted interdenominational solidarity, while groups like the Korean Church Women United, the Urban Industrial Mission, and the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF) developed practical ministries aligned with justice and service. As one statement encapsulated the ethos of the time:\n\n“The church is not a safe haven from the world, but a community called into the world.”\n\n\nNorth Korea: Reorganization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and the Rise of Socialist Christianity\n\nWhile Christianity in the South was contesting dictatorship, in North Korea it was undergoing a transformation into a state-managed religious apparatus. The 1972 Socialist Constitution of North Korea formally declared freedom of religion, but with a significant caveat: this freedom was only protected \"as long as it does not disrupt social order\". This stipulation effectively subordinated all religious practice to the authority of the Workers’ Party.\n\nThe centerpiece of North Korea’s religious strategy was the reorganization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF). Far from being an autonomous religious body, the KCF became a political tool to facilitate international diplomacy. Through efforts such as applying for membership in the World Council of Churches (WCC), the KCF sought to project an image of religious tolerance to the outside world. However, critics noted that this was merely a diplomatic ploy. As Kim Heung-soo argued, “The activities of the KCF have nothing to do with theological autonomy and merely serve to express state ideology in religious language.”\n\nInternally, the regime recast Christianity as compatible with Juche ideology. Core Christian principles such as \"love\" were reinterpreted as loyalty to the leader and sacrifice for the nation. Worship services were co-opted into political events, and all religious expression was subject to surveillance.\n\nThis tightly controlled integration meant that public Christianity existed only within state-defined parameters, while theological education, independent preaching, and free association were prohibited. Despite these restrictions, some sources suggest that underground churches persisted during the 1970s, indicating a residual spiritual yearning among the North Korean population. Official publications described Christianity not as a superstition that dulled the masses, but rather as an ethical system repurposed to serve socialist society. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nKorea’s Diplomatic Relations with Asian-pacific Neighbors\n\n\nThe 1970s were marked by shifting diplomatic realignments in East and Southeast Asia, particularly as Cold War pressures intensified. These dynamics were reflected in how Christianity in Korea intersected with foreign policy—particularly with Japan, Vietnam, China, and North Korea.\n\nKorea’s relationship with Japan remained strained due to lingering colonial memories, many of which were deeply etched in the Korean Christian conscience. The Japanese colonial government’s imposition of Shinto shrine worship on Christians during the 1930s and 40s created long-lasting wounds, and even in the 1970s, these historical scars complicated efforts at religious reconciliation. As one historian notes, “Korean Christianity’s nationalism was in large part shaped by its resistance to Japanese assimilation policies, with pastors and believers martyred or imprisoned for rejecting shrine worship” . During the 1970s, no formal religious reconciliation occurred, but Korean churches periodically raised concerns about Japanese textbook revisions and war crime denial.\n\nIn contrast, Vietnam became a site of active Korean military and Christian involvement during the Vietnam War. South Korea, under President Park Chung Hee, dispatched over 300,000 troops between 1965 and 1973. Korean churches generally supported the war effort as a struggle against communism. According to the article Korea Churches’ Attitude toward the Vietnam war, “most Korean Protestant leaders justified participation in the Vietnam War as part of a sacred anti-communist mission” . The Presbyterian Church and the Korean Methodist Church even interpreted military service as an extension of evangelistic duty .\n\nYet this alignment with U.S. and South Vietnamese forces isolated Korean churches from the international Christian peace movement. Korean Protestant leaders defended their government’s role and rebuked foreign theologians for lacking understanding of communism’s threat .\n\nMeanwhile, China and North Korea remained diplomatically closed to South Korea, but were referenced in religious discourse. The ideological proximity of North Korea and China, particularly in their shared hostility toward Christianity, was repeatedly cited in Korean Protestant publications. One editorial warned that “China’s eradication of Christian churches shows the true face of Marxist atheism” .\n\nIn North Korea, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) made overtures such as applying for WCC membership, which were regarded as propaganda by the South. As Kim Heung-soo explains, the KCF’s gestures were part of “a diplomatic strategy to present the DPRK as a religiously tolerant nation,” though it was tightly state-controlled .\n\n\nKorea’s Relations with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\n\nThe 1970s witnessed dynamic interactions between Korea and Christian-majority nations, especially the United States and West Germany.\n\nThe United States remained Korea’s closest ally both politically and religiously. Many Korean church leaders had been educated in American seminaries. Billy Graham’s 1973 crusade in Seoul drew over a million people and was hailed as a national religious event. As one newspaper reported, “This is not only a religious awakening, but a reaffirmation of our alliance with Christian civilization” .\n\nWest Germany, in contrast, supported Korea’s democratization through Christian civil society. The German Protestant Church (EKD) partnered with NCCK and progressive Korean churches. As Kim Jin-ho writes, “West German churches were among the few international actors who stood with Korea’s democratization movement when others remained silent” . However, such alliances deepened domestic theological rifts. Conservative churches leaned toward U.S.-style anti-communist theology, while progressives aligned with the WCC and CCA. Foreign relations thus fed into theological and political polarization within Korean Christianity.\n\n\nPatriotism and Nationalism\n\n\nThe 1970s were defined by state-led nationalism under Park Chung Hee’s Yushin regime. Nationalism was expressed in public rituals, press narratives, and ideological education—and churches were both collaborators and critics.\n\nKey to this agenda was anti-communism as civic religion. The National Education Charter was recited even in churches, and religious groups were expected to promote loyalty and national discipline. Park stated, “Religions must help the people cultivate spiritual power to serve the nation and fight against the Red tide” .\n\nConservative churches embraced this model. The Minjok Bogeumhwa Movement (Evangelization of the Nation) aimed to convert the Korean people by 1980 with government support. According to Kim Seong-han, “The movement fused evangelism with nationalism, presenting Christianity as the moral engine of Korea’s modernization and anti-communist struggle” .\n\nProgressive Christians, however, resisted. The NCCK’s 1974 declaration stated that “true faith cannot serve political idolatry,” opposing the merging of faith with state propaganda . This caused backlash from conservative denominations and the press, who saw it as undermining national unity. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nChae, Soo-il, and Heung-soo Kim. 2003. “The Theological Foundations for the Social Engagement of Progressive Churches in the 1970s.” Christianity and History in Korea 18: 9–35.\n\nIlbo, Chosun. 1973. “100,000 Gather for Billy Graham Crusade.” June 5, 1973.\n\nKim, Heung-soo. 2005. “The Korean Christian Federation’s Application to Join the WCC.” Christianity and History in Korea 22: 103–127.\n\nKim, Jin-ho. 2016. “The Solidarity of German Churches and Korean Democratization.” Critical Review of History 95: 150–178.\n\nKim, Seong-han. 2024.
