These dynamics were reflected in how Christianity in Korea intersected with foreign policy—particularly with Japan, Vietnam, China, and North Korea.\n\nKorea’s relationship with Japan remained strained due to lingering colonial memories, many of which were deeply etched in the Korean Christian conscience. The Japanese colonial government’s imposition of Shinto shrine worship on Christians during the 1930s and 40s created long-lasting wounds, and even in the 1970s, these historical scars complicated efforts at religious reconciliation. As one historian notes, “Korean Christianity’s nationalism was in large part shaped by its resistance to Japanese assimilation policies, with pastors and believers martyred or imprisoned for rejecting shrine worship” . During the 1970s, no formal religious reconciliation occurred, but Korean churches periodically raised concerns about Japanese textbook revisions and war crime denial.\n\nIn contrast, Vietnam became a site of active Korean military and Christian involvement during the Vietnam War. South Korea, under President Park Chung Hee, dispatched over 300,000 troops between 1965 and 1973. Korean churches generally supported the war effort as a struggle against communism. According to the article Korea Churches’ Attitude toward the Vietnam war, “most Korean Protestant leaders justified participation in the Vietnam War as part of a sacred anti-communist mission” . The Presbyterian Church and the Korean Methodist Church even interpreted military service as an extension of evangelistic duty .\n\nYet this alignment with U.S. and South Vietnamese forces isolated Korean churches from the international Christian peace movement. Korean Protestant leaders defended their government’s role and rebuked foreign theologians for lacking understanding of communism’s threat .\n\nMeanwhile, China and North Korea remained diplomatically closed to South Korea, but were referenced in religious discourse. The ideological proximity of North Korea and China, particularly in their shared hostility toward Christianity, was repeatedly cited in Korean Protestant publications. One editorial warned that “China’s eradication of Christian churches shows the true face of Marxist atheism” .\n\nIn North Korea, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) made overtures such as applying for WCC membership, which were regarded as propaganda by the South. As Kim Heung-soo explains, the KCF’s gestures were part of “a diplomatic strategy to present the DPRK as a religiously tolerant nation,” though it was tightly state-controlled .\n\n\nKorea’s Relations with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\n\nThe 1970s witnessed dynamic interactions between Korea and Christian-majority nations, especially the United States and West Germany.\n\nThe United States remained Korea’s closest ally both politically and religiously. Many Korean church leaders had been educated in American seminaries. Billy Graham’s 1973 crusade in Seoul drew over a million people and was hailed as a national religious event. As one newspaper reported, “This is not only a religious awakening, but a reaffirmation of our alliance with Christian civilization” .\n\nWest Germany, in contrast, supported Korea’s democratization through Christian civil society. The German Protestant Church (EKD) partnered with NCCK and progressive Korean churches. As Kim Jin-ho writes, “West German churches were among the few international actors who stood with Korea’s democratization movement when others remained silent” . However, such alliances deepened domestic theological rifts. Conservative churches leaned toward U.S.-style anti-communist theology, while progressives aligned with the WCC and CCA. Foreign relations thus fed into theological and political polarization within Korean Christianity.\n\n\nPatriotism and Nationalism\n\n\nThe 1970s were defined by state-led nationalism under Park Chung Hee’s Yushin regime. Nationalism was expressed in public rituals, press narratives, and ideological education—and churches were both collaborators and critics.\n\nKey to this agenda was anti-communism as civic religion. The National Education Charter was recited even in churches, and religious groups were expected to promote loyalty and national discipline. Park stated, “Religions must help the people cultivate spiritual power to serve the nation and fight against the Red tide” .\n\nConservative churches embraced this model. The Minjok Bogeumhwa Movement (Evangelization of the Nation) aimed to convert the Korean people by 1980 with government support. According to Kim Seong-han, “The movement fused evangelism with nationalism, presenting Christianity as the moral engine of Korea’s modernization and anti-communist struggle” .\n\nProgressive Christians, however, resisted. The NCCK’s 1974 declaration stated that “true faith cannot serve political idolatry,” opposing the merging of faith with state propaganda . This caused backlash from conservative denominations and the press, who saw it as undermining national unity.\n\n ",
