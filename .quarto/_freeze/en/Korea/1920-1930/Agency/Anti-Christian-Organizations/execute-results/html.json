According to statistics at the time, Cheondoism had approximately 2 million believers. This number of believers was nearly six times larger than the second-ranked Christianity, which had around 350,000 believers. Considering that the Korean population was around 18 million at that time, the fact that Cheondoism had 2 million followers indicates that a significant portion of Koreans believed in Cheondoism. This clearly demonstrates that Cheondoism was the largest single religion in terms of size.\n\nAs the year 1924 approached, colonial Korean society witnessed significant changes in the social landscape. Socialist forces were experiencing rapid growth. In April 1924, socialist forces established the Chosun Youth Alliance, a youth movement organization. The Chosun Youth Alliance was the first nationwide organization of socialist forces, formed through the collaboration of various youth organizations in Seoul, newly emerging youth groups, and the Chosun Youth Federation. The Chosun Youth Alliance attracted significant attention, not only from movement organizations but also culturally, as socialist ideology rapidly spread throughout colonial Korean society.\n\nDue to this changing social atmosphere, Cheondoist forces were also influenced to some extent by socialist ideology. First, there was an increase in the introduction of socialist movements and ideologies through the pages of progressive journals, and individuals with socialist tendencies within the Cheondoist ranks gradually strengthened their beliefs. From 1924 onwards, socialist influences began to be increasingly noticeable within the claims and statements made by Cheondoist forces. In March 1924, Yi Don-hwa published an article titled \"Differences Between the Three Major World Religions and the Daily Life of Cheondoists\" in the Kaebek E, where he quoted Kroptkin, asserting that the root cause of human misconduct lay in the social system. He believed that by completely reforming the social system, the evils of human society could be eliminated.\n\nThe changing consciousness within Cheondoist forces also extended to religious issues. They began to move beyond the broad concept of criticizing \"established religions\" and started to develop more specific content. Critiques began to target the religions among the \"established religions\" that were most closely associated with social problems. These criticisms started emerging from 1924, and one of the chosen targets of Cheondoist criticism was Christianity.\n\nAt the time, Christianity was the largest among the officially recognized religions in terms of size. It had close political ties with the Korean Government-General and, economically, had established foundations with considerable assets. Therefore, Christianity was positioned closely to the socioeconomic elite of society. Prominent Christians, such as Sin Heung-woo, although not entirely denouncing Christianity as capitalism, did acknowledge that it was being exploited by the capitalist class. Cheondoism sharply criticized the problems associated with Christianity, as they saw it as a significant part of the social issues present at that time. However, Cheondoism did not criticize Christianity as a religion itself, as doing so would have implied potential backlash towards their own beliefs. Thus, Cheondoism's opposition to religion by religious forces remained primarily an intellectual movement through the pages of the Kaebek E rather than a comprehensive mass movement.\n\n최보민.

Prior to 1925, there had been declarations of opposition to religion by socialist forces, but they were mostly of a theoretical nature aimed at religion in general. However, at the 1925 conference, Christianity as a religion was explicitly mentioned, distinguishing it from previous declarations. Although the conference was not allowed to take place due to interference from the Japanese police, the confiscated documents included statements criticizing capitalism and imperialism, with a central focus on criticizing Christianity.\n\nThe close association of Christianity with the capitalist class was a significant reason for socialist opposition. Particularly, the socialist forces, including those who formed the Chosun Communist Party, held radical views. The Chosun Communist Party advocated for a direct proletarian revolution that skipped the stage of national revolution, emphasizing a thorough class revolution centered on laborers and peasants. Given this radical stance, it was only natural for the Chosun Communist Party to criticize Christianity, which was closely associated with the capitalist class.\n\nHowever, in addition to the influence of radical revolutionary views, another factor to consider is the policy of the Korean Communist Party related to the National Unification Front. During its founding in 1925, the Korean Communist Party adhered to the principle of rejecting \"compromising\" or \"reformist\" elements within the National Unification Front. Similarly, the Korean Communist Party and the Communist Youth League held similar policies. They advocated forming a National Unification Front with \"revolutionary\" elements and identified Cheondoism as one of the revolutionary forces that could be part of the Unification Front. However, they believed that Christianity needed to be exposed for its true nature.\n\nIn 1925, at the Third Regular Meeting, the New Youth League adopted its action plan, which included a resolution regarding religious issues as the seventh item. The resolution, similar to those discussed in the People's Movement Activists Conference, criticized religion, particularly Christianity, as an institution that supported the capitalist class. The execution of this plan was entrusted to the Intelligence Committee.\n\nIn September 1925, during the Fourth Regular Meeting, the New Youth League established its plan for an anti-Christian movement. They decided to create and distribute pamphlets against Christianity and organize large and small gatherings to promote the movement. Through propaganda and rallies, they aimed to expand the anti-Christian movement.\n\nHowever, the plans adopted at the Fourth Regular Meeting were not implemented effectively due to intense pressure from the Japanese authorities. The colonial authorities were highly sensitive to the activities of socialist individuals related to religion. The police prohibited the dissemination of information related to the anti-Christian movement based on the resolution of the Third Regular Meeting. The reasons given for these measures were that they could harm public morals, revealing the colonial authorities' determination to prevent any issues that could become social problems.\n\nNevertheless, on October 7, 1925, news spread through newspapers that the Second All-Korea Sunday School Conference was going to be held. In response, a large-scale anti-Christian movement was planned. The Han-yang Youth League was the main organizer of this movement. Formed in early August 1925, the Han-yang Youth League was a coalition organization of youth groups in the vicinity of Keijo (now Seoul). On October 21, 1925, the Second All-Korea Sunday School Conference took place, attracting thousands of Christians from across the nation. The exact number of attendees was reported to be around 3,000. To accommodate the large crowd, the conference was divided into two locations: Insadong and Jongno. It was a significant event with various activities such as lectures on psychology, teaching methods, and religious sermons.\n\nDuring the conference, anti-Christian sermons were banned by the police. When the Han-yang Youth League's anti-Christian lecture meeting was canceled, it caused a social uproar, leading to public opinion forming in favor of Japanese protection of Christianity. These oppressive measures by the Japanese authorities only fueled the enthusiasm for the anti-Christian movement.\n\nMotivated by this enthusiasm, the Han-yang Youth League designated December 25th as \"Anti-Christian Day\" and resolved to continue various large and small activities, including creating pamphlets and conducting thorough anti-Christian propaganda. However, these efforts by the Han-yang Youth League did not succeed. The reasons included the intense suppression following the Sinuiju Incident, which led to the arrest of most of the Central Executive Committee members of the Communist Youth League, as well as the Korean Communist Party. This practically brought their organizations to the brink of collapse.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Communist Party issued a directive to form a more populist National Unification Front, and a new leadership approved it. The anti-Christian movement came into conflict with the popular National Unification Front, and, in effect, the anti-Christian movement disappeared after 1926.\n\n ",
