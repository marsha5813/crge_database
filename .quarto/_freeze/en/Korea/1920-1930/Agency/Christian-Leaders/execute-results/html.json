(?)\n\nEducation: He didn’t receive any educational degree from the Westernized institutions, but he was a profound scholar in Chinese literature. Although he failed the civil service exam at the Joseon government multiple times, Henry Appenzeller, who was the prominent methodist missionary in Korea, invited him to Bai-jae school as a teacher of Chinese classics. Appenzeller introduced him to Christianity, and guided him to become a pastor.   \n\nContributions: Choi, Byung-hun is a pastor, scholar in Chinese literature, teacher, and literary independent movement activist. Particularly, he developed a theoretical platform of Korean-indigenized Christianity based on his profound knowledge of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. He is a pioneer of comparative study of religion and dialectic of Christianity in Korea. His first article, 예수텬쥬량교변론耶穌天主兩敎辯論 was published in 1908 and a collection of his writings, The World of Religion (만종일련 萬宗一臠) and 한철집요 漢哲輯要 were published in 1922. As the literary mission work was proliferated in  1920s, I would like to put his contributions in this decade. \n\nPromoting the Literary Mission of the Protestant Church, Especially Among Intellectuals: Choi's upbringing was steeped in Chinese literature, and he made three attempts to pass the civil service exam (Gwagoe) without success. Subsequently, he assumed the role of a tutor for Korean language instruction under the American Methodist missionary George Heber Jones. Later, he was invited to teach at the Bai-jae school by Appenzeller. During this period, Western missionaries were often viewed as foreign entities, colloquially known as \"Western ghosts,\" who allegedly harmed infants, an incident referred to as the \"baby riot\" in Pyongyang in 1988.\n\nHowever, Choi took a different approach. He observed how Western missionaries earnestly endeavored to alleviate poverty and despair among the Joseon people. Drawing upon his knowledge of Confucianism within the Korean context, Choi sought to comprehend Christianity and the missionaries. Lee Deok-ju (2008) explained Choi's conversion, attributing it to his concerns about a corrupt government and its uncertain future, his admiration for Western missionaries' efforts to improve the lives of ordinary Joseon citizens, and his perception of Christianity as a vehicle for modernizing Joseon. Choi was baptized by Jones and later served as an assistant pastor at Jeondong-Jaeil Church in Seoul. He became the first Korean pastor at Jeongdong-Jaeil Church after the tragic drowning of Appenzeller, who had heroically saved a girl's life. Choi also maintained a concurrent role as a civil service worker in the Joseon government, which enabled him to advocate for the cessation of military actions by righteous military groups.\n\nChoi's involvement in promoting the enlightenment movement in rural areas sparked controversy among contemporary historians, who debated the true nature of his contributions. Regardless of his political entanglements, Choi authored \"Seong-san-Yu-Rm-Gi,\" a serialized novel exploring Christianity and existing religions. These writings were published in the \"Biblical and Church Monthly,\" known as \"Shin-hak-wol-bo.\" A compilation of his work was released as \"Seong-san-myeong-gyeong\" in 1912. This novel marked the first dialectic Christian text challenging native religions. Through his publications employing dialectic approaches, Choi portrayed Christianity as an extension of Korean culture and its native religions, rather than a foreign import. Some scholars have even attributed the lyrics of the Korean national anthem to Choi, in collaboration with Yun Chi-ho and Ahn Chang-ho (Kim, 2021; Park, 2015). If this is indeed the case, the anthem serves as a prime example of his indigenized theology.\n\nChoi's insights and direction resonated with intellectuals who grappled with conflicting ideologies and the need to navigate their own paths to salvation and national betterment. Additionally, Choi actively participated in the Independence Club and contributed to the Independence Newspaper. He also played a pivotal role in assisting Jones in the publication of an English-Korean dictionary in 1914. Jones acknowledged Choi's significant contributions in accurately translating adjectives between the two languages and finding suitable vocabulary, crucial as an increasing number of Western terms found their way into Joseon.\n\nFurthermore, Choi played a vital role in preserving the Korean language, Hangul, during the colonial era. Alongside Bible translations, he published \"Je-guk-shin-mun\" in Korean and served as an editor. He also published the \"Biblical and Church Monthly,\" \"Shin-hak-wol-bo,\" in Korean (Park, 1997). Choi's publications have greatly enriched the understanding of Christianity and the church in the context of existing Korean religions and culture, earning admiration from many intellectuals who aspired to rescue Joseon during that period. These thoughts later influenced theologians and church activists in shaping Christianity and the church within the Korean context.\n\nFacilitating Indigenous Theology: Choi's book, \"The World of Religion\" (만종일련 萬宗一臠), initiated a comparative study of religions. It encompassed major world religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism (선교), Islam, Hinduism, as well as new religions like Tenrikyo 天理教 and Gyeongcheon-gyo 敬天敎, offering a rationale for Christianity. Choi contended that within the broader context of the World of Religion, Confucianism posits that a virtuous person is akin to heaven, and it should not be regarded solely as a monotheistic belief but also as a polytheistic faith encompassing ancestral rites, earthly deities, and mountain spirits.\n\nHe further articulated that the afterlife held no promise in Buddhism, critiquing it for its passivity concerning social service and societal change. Choi's overarching point was that it wasn't a matter of Confucianism, Buddhism, or Daoism being inherently wrong; instead, he argued that the truths of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism had been realized within Christianity. Christians, he noted, also maintained the doctrine of being reborn in Christ. Kim Kwang-sik summarized Choi's perspective as follows: \"True Christianity doesn't revolve around metaphysical truths or the expansion of worldly power, and its authenticity isn't determined by the display of miracles. Rather, the essence of Christianity lies in the salvation of humanity\" (p. 138-139).\n\nChoi's inclusive approach of embracing other religions rather than rejecting them garnered respect within the Korean Christian community, both in his era and continues to be a subject of debate to this day.\n\n\nKim, Maria. 김마리아 金瑪利亞\n\nBirth/Death: 1892/06/18 (Hwanghae-do, Jangyeon) ~ 1944/03/23 (Hamgyeongnam-do, Wonsan)\n\nEducation: Kim Maria was born into an affluent Christian household. Her father converted to Christianity early on and even established an elementary school in their hometown. Many of her relatives were independence activists who worked in the provisional government. Kim Maria graduated from Jeong-Shin Girls’ School where emphasized nurturing Korean women leaders, not Americanized women education. She was inspired by Shin, Maria (1873-1921), a vice-principal who taught that God’s kids must love our nation and neighbors, and become ‘a grain of wheat’ of the world. Kim went to Severance hospital to take care wound righteous army and indigenous people who participated in the protest against King Go-jong’s abdication. Later, she went on to study abroad at Do-kyo Women's College in 1914. Later, in 1923, she pursued further studies in the United States, earning a master's degree from Park College and the University of Chicago. Subsequently, she obtained a doctorate in theology from the Theological Seminary School of New York.\n\nContributions: Her contribution was found in developing women-centered organizations in Japan, the U.S., and Korea for facilitating women’s liberation movement and independent movement. I will focus on her leadership of Korean Patriotic Women’s Association (KPWA) and Gen-hwa-hoe 槿花會 in 1920s. (I will put her work between 1917 and 1919 here and separate it into 1910s later.)\n\nTokyo Korean Women Student Council 東京女子留學生親睦會. In the 1910s, Kim, Maria studied abroad in Japan, where there was an average of 5-600 Korean students (National Institute of Korean History). They organized the Korean Student Association and published a magazine called 'Lux Scientiae' twice a year. In addition to the male-dominated Korean Student Association, female students, led by Kim Pil-rye, organized the Tokyo Women's Student Friendship Association in 1915. Kim Maria was elected as the second president in 1916 and founded a magazine called 'Women's World' in 1917. This was the first magazine published by and for women during the Japanese colonial period and received a significant response both domestically and internationally. Under Kim Maria's leadership, the Tokyo Women's Student Friendship Association became widely known among Japanese students studying abroad and became a center for women's and independence movements. Influential female students of the time, such as Na Hye-seok and Hwang Esther, joined, further enhancing its reputation. In 1919, they also participated in the March 1st Independence Movement, contributing 30 won to the independence fund. However, among the 11 signatories of the February 8th Independence Declaration, there were no women, and Kim Maria returned to Korea, struggling with the direction of the women's movement. At this time, what's important to note is that she copied the March 1st Independence Declaration and concealed it in her belt as she returned to Korea. She returned to Korea and conveyed news of the March 1st Movement. She actively participated in the pre-movement activities for the March 1st Movement in Daegu, Gwangju, Seoul, and her hometown, Hwanghae Province. At a meeting on March 2nd, she passionately encouraged student participation, saying, \"Yesterday marked the beginning of Korea's independence movement. Since male students are actively involved, we women cannot just stand by and watch. Female students must also participate in the movement.\" On March 5th, she was arrested by Japanese military police but was released on August 5th after enduring harsh treatment. She later became a faculty member at her alma mater, Jeongshin Women's School.\n\nKorean Patriotic Women’s Association (KPWA), 대한민국애국부인회, 1919. On October 19, 1919, Kim Maria founded the Korean Patriotic Women's Association at the home of Lillian Dean Miller, who was working as a teacher at Jeongshin Women's School. This organization was formed by merging two existing groups: the \"Blood Loyalty Women's Patriotic Association,\" which was organized to support the Provisional Government, and the \"Greater Korea Independence Women's Patriotic Association,\" which was organized without the knowledge of the Provisional Government but shared the same goals.\n\nKim Maria stated, \"Our women must engage in the independence movement as passionately as men. Fortunately, Oh Hyun-joo has organized the Women's Association as its president and has been pushing for independence. However, this association had only a few members from Korea. This time, let's establish branches in each region of Korea and recruit members widely so that women across the nation can work for independence. What do you think about that?\"\n\nThis represented a call for equal participation of men and women in the independence movement, setting a different standard from the traditional passive and supportive role of women in anti-Japanese activities. Article 2 of their rules stated, \"The purpose of this association is to promote the Constitution of the Republic of Korea,\" implying that women also fulfill their obligations as citizens.\n\nKim Maria abandoned the previous localized and limited organizational structure and expanded the association nationwide, establishing branches in North Korea, Jeju Island, and even Hawaii. She sent the rules of the Korean Patriotic Women's Association along with 2,000 won to Lee Seung-man, who was the president of the Provisional Government at the time.\n\nIn November 1919, she, along with other key members, was arrested again by Japanese military police. Missionary L.D. Miller, Dr. F.W. Schofield, and Pastor W.N. Blair applied for her release, citing her harsh torture, and on May 22, 1920, she was granted her freedom.\n\nFemale Independence Work at the Provisional Government. The incident of her seeking asylum in China on July 21, 1921, shocked the Japanese government. At that time, there was a deep conflict between factions within the independence movement. On one side, there was the \"Creation Party\" that strongly opposed Lee Seung-man's Provisional Government, and on the other side, there was the \"Reform Party\" that recognized the authority of the Provisional Government and aimed to bring about reforms. In an attempt to resolve this conflict, a National Representatives' Conference was convened on January 31, 1923. Kim Maria reported on the activities of the Korean Patriotic Women's Association. Her strong belief in saving the country through education led her to enroll at the Bible Teacher Training School in Nanjing (now Nanjing Normal University) to pursue further studies. Even there, she organized the \"Korean Young Women's Association\" in 1923, rallying the strength of female students.  \n\nGeunhwahoe (Korean Patriotic Women’s Association (KPWA) of the U.S.). With a determination for independence through education, she left for the United States. After graduating from Park College and relocating to New York, she discovered that the New York Korean community's organization called the \"Dongjihoi,\" which was set up to publish the March 1st newspaper, did not include women. At that time, prominent figures in the Korean and Chinese independence movements such as Park In-deok, Hwang Esther, and Jeong Ae-kyung were in New York. Together with them, she organized the \"Geunhwahoe\" in 1928, with \"Geunhwa\" symbolizing the Korean national flower, the rose of Sharon.\n\nThe purposes of Geunhwahoe were as follows: first, to instill a national spirit to promote unity among Koreans; second, to encourage education and vocational training; third, to widely publicize the colonial situation in Korea to the world; and fourth, to provide support for the establishment of a new country. They also established various branches such as the Unemployment Division, Education Division, and Social Division to carry out organized independence activities.\n\n\"...Our goal is not to advocate nationalism, which may seem outdated or irrelevant to some, or which some may think of as advocating for patriotism. We all have a sense of patriotism in various cases. However, when we are deeply involved in something, the love for our nation, the most important element among all, often fades, and we may not even know what we are advocating for. That's why we aim to further nurture the love for our nation.\" (Shinhanminbo, 1928.04.05. cited by Lee, 2020, p. 36). \n\nLater, news arrived that Chinese officials in Manchuria were issuing orders against Korean expatriates and engaging in abuse. In response, the Dongjihoi New York branch, the New York Korean Residents Association, the National Association of New York, and Geunhwahoe united to form the \"New York Korean Expatriate Advocacy Association\" and carried out activities to support Korean expatriates. Kim Maria participated in this effort as the president of Geunhwahoe.\n\nAt the time, although interactions among Korean expatriates in New York were frequent, most of them stayed temporarily for labor or education and then left for other places, resulting in a small permanent population. Many of the executives of Geunhwahoe were also in an unstable student status, so the organization's activities were not sustained consistently. Nonetheless, Geunhwahoe holds significant importance as an organization formed by Korean women living abroad in colonial Korea, who persevered in supporting their homeland's liberation despite the challenges. Kim Maria's unwavering determination for independence, even amidst the hardships of her student life in a foreign country, led her to organize and actively engage in a women's anti-Japanese movement organization.\n\n\n3) Lee, Sang-jae 이상재 李商在\n\nBirth/Death: 1850/10/26 (Choongcheong-do, Hansan-myeon) ~ 1927/03/29 (Seoul)\n\nEducation: Lee studied Chinese literature and served as a public officer in the Joseon dynasty and the Korean Empire. He was a supporter and member of the Enlightenment Party during the Gapshin Coup (1884) and the Gob-o Revolution (1894-1895). He converted while in jail in 1902, as a result of his involvement in the Independence Club and Manmingongdong-hoe incident. Rhee Syngman, who was also incarcerated, gave him the Bible, and Lee was deeply impressed by Matthew's \"Love your enemy.\" Many independence movement activists, such as Kim Jeong-sik, Yoo Seng-jun, Lee Dong-ryeong, as well as Lee Sang-jae and Rhee Syngman, converted to Protestantism during this imprisonment, which was known as the \"Revolutionary Party Incident.\" This marked a unique aspect of the Protestant church and Christianity in Korea. Up until that time, the majority of Christians consisted of middle and lower-class individuals. However, with the conversion of these activists, Christianity rapidly spread among the upper class and intellectuals in Korea. Lee founded the \"Thatched House Church\" in his hometown and later actively participated in Hwangseong YMCA and youth education.\n\nContribution: Lee, Sang-jae is an activist of enlightenment movement and independence movement, educator, particularly for youth education. In the history of independence movement of Korea, Lee has been respected by both conservative and progressive parties. The reason of inserting him in 1920s is to highlight his contributions on the provisional government in Shanghai and youth education in Korea. \n\n [This part will be moved to 1900-1910 decade later.] Establishing the foundation of YMCA. After his release from prison in 1904, Lee Sang-jae devoted himself to the YMCA movement. While the independence movement of the Independence Association was a political movement aimed at preventing Russia's encroachment on Korea's sovereignty, the YMCA movement sought to resist Japan's invasion and achieve Korea's independence through religious and cultural means. Considering that many Independence Association figures dedicated themselves to the YMCA movement after their release from prison during this period, it becomes clear that this was essentially the same independence movement in a different form.\n\nAt that time, Gale was the president of Hwangseong YMCA, and Gillett was the treasurer. The board consisted of four Americans, three British, two Canadians, one Japanese, and two Koreans. In this sense, Hwangseong YMCA was an international organization composed of citizens from five countries, enjoying a kind of extraterritorial status. In 1905, they began to appoint Korean practitioners. Lee Sang-jae became the Chairman of the Education Department of the YMCA in 1905 and later became the Head of the Religious Department in 1908. The primary purpose of the YMCA's activities shifted to promoting Korean nationalist thought. Together with other Independence Association colleagues such as Yoon Chi-ho and Kim Gyu-sik, Lee Sang-jae implemented various modern sports and subjects, including Korean, English, music, and conducted Bible studies. He also organized evening classes for young laborers. While the Chinese YMCA focused on sports education and the Japanese YMCA emphasized church education, the Korean YMCA implemented a school-based approach. During the process of Japan formalizing its colonial rule over Korea, Lee Sang-jae traveled to various places, shouting slogans such as \"Wake up, fellow countrymen, and awaken your spirit\" through YMCA educational programs and various seminars. This eventually evolved into the \"One Million Souls Movement\" in 1909.\n\n[This part will be moved to 1910-1920 decade later.] In 1913, Lee Sang-jae was elected as the general secretary of the Chosun Central Christian Youth Association, succeeding Gillette. Prior to this, there had been attempts by the Chosun Governor-General's Office to Japanize the Chosun YMCA. Therefore, Lee Sang-jae refused financial support from Japan and established a financial foundation and structure for independent survival. He also revitalized night schools for students who studied during the day and strengthened vocational and industrial education. This policy was aimed at providing educational benefits to those who were previously excluded, and it created an environment within the YMCA where both the yangban (nobility) and common people could study freely. In April 1914, at the Triennial Convention, the \"Constitution of the Union of Chosun Christian Youth Associations\" was publicly announced, thereby eliminating the merger with the Japanese YMCA.\n\n\nLee Sang-jae was chosen as one of the 33 national representatives during the March 1st Movement but declined the offer. The reason was that he had a lot to do behind the scenes after the movement. One reason was the anticipated conflicts with missionary workers critical of political involvement and potential suppression of the YMCA if he were to become a representative (Go, 2004). Additionally, he invited American congressmen to Korea via Shanghai to seek international support with Yun, Chi-ho and was preparing to send Korean youth representatives to the Paris Peace Conference (Kim, 2010).\n\nIn May 1922, Lee Sang-jae obtained independence for the Chosun YMCA from the Japanese YMCA, and in 1924, the Chosun YMCA was formally admitted to the World Alliance of YMCA as an independent organization. In April 1922, at the First International Christian Students' Union Conference held in Beijing, Lee Sang-jae, along with other female leaders such as Kim Pil-ye and Kim Hwal-ran, attended as representatives of the Chosun Christian Youth Association. Upon their return, he actively contributed to the formal establishment of the YWCA.\n\nThe 1920s witnessed effective cooperation between Lee Sang-jae and Lee Seung-man. Lee Sang-jae actively supported a visit by a group of Korean students from Hawaii and Lee Seung-man used this visit to inspect the situation of the independence movement in Korea. Lee Sang-jae played a central role in domestic Christian circles sympathetic to Lee Seung-man, while Lee Seung-man raised funds and support to enable Korean representatives to attend the Pan-Pacific Educational Conference in Hawaii in August 1921 and the Pan-Pacific Problem Research Conference in June 1925.\n\nNext, Lee Sang-jae actively participated in the movement to establish private universities. He was elected as the president of the \"Chosun Educational Association\" at its general assembly in June 1920, and in November, the \"Chosun Private University Preparatory Committee\" was formed. Since Japan fundamentally opposed the establishment of university facilities in Korea, private universities were not established as a result.\n\nDuring this period, both domestic and international nationalist activists agreed that they needed to achieve independence on their own and establish a focal point for the independence movement within Korea, particularly in the wake of failures at the Paris Peace Conference. Lee Seung-man was attempting to restrain the influence of the Ahn Chang-ho faction within the Provisional Government and Lee Sang-jae took the lead in establishing a domestic base for Lee Seung-man's independence movement. In 1925, the Heungup Gullakbu (흥업구락부) was organized as a counter-organization to the Heungsadan (흥사단). They worked diligently to gain control over Christian cultural organizations in Korea for fundraising and membership recruitment. In the 1920s, the independence movement was also divided into nationalist and socialist factions. Lee Sang-jae was appointed as the president of the Chosun Ilbo and, in an effort to promote cooperation between nationalist and socialist factions, he persuaded both sides to form a \"National Cooperative Front.\" Subsequently, he assumed the position of the inaugural chairman of the Shin-gan Society, but in 1927, he passed away in a small attic in Seoul without a home of his own. He was a pillar of the Christian nationalist movement.\n\nHyun, Soon, 현순, 玄楯\n\nBirth/Death: 1880/02/28 (Seoul) ~ 1968/07/11 (Los Angeles, U.S.A.)\n\nEducation: Hyun, Soon initially studied Chinese literature when he was young but later attended a government-run English school to further his education. In 1899, he went to Japan to study at Suncheon Middle School (順天中學, Jun Den Kiu Ko Sa). Due to a lack of funds, he had to give up his dream of attending Imperial University and returned to Korea. However, he converted to Christianity in Japan. Before coming to Japan, he had heard about Christianity through his exposure to the Independence Association and speeches by Yun Chi-ho in Seoul, so he was somewhat familiar with it. Through the evangelism efforts of her friend, Shim Ui-sung, he came to understand the following about Christianity: \"Confucianism teaches ethics, morals, and politics; Buddhism teaches past lives, the present life, and the afterlife; Christianity teaches eternal life\" (Han, 1999, p. 14). Upon his return to Korea, he worked as an interpreter for the East-West Development Co. It was during this time that he met George H. Jones, a Methodist missionary who actively recruited Korean immigrants for Hawaii. This encounter led Hyun, Soon and his family to immigrate to Hawaii in 1903. Upon witnessing the challenging realities of immigrant society, he, along with his colleagues, established the first Korean church in Hawaii, the Honolulu Korean Methodist Church. In 1905, he completed her pastoral training in the local circuit minister's education program on the island of Kauai. Around this time,he reunited with missionary Jones, who was on vacation in the United States, and at his invitation, he worked as an assistant pastor alongside Pastor Choi, Byung-heon at Jungdong Jaeil Church. In 1910, upon his return to Korea, he enrolled in the Methodist affiliated Hyupsung Theological Seminary and graduated in the following year, 1911, officially becoming a Methodist pastor.\n\nContribution\n\n[This part will be moved to 1901-1910 decade later.] Frontier of the Korean Immigrant Church. Upon arriving in Hawaii in 1903, he worked as an interpreter and, at the same time, organized a self-fulfilling association with around 50 Korean laborers. They gathered weekly for worship. First-generation Korean activists like Ahn Jung-su, Im Chi-jeong, Lee Gyo-dam, Hong Seung-ha, Yoon Byung-goo, Park Yoon-seop, and others, under the leadership of Pastor Pearson of the Methodist Church, established the Korean Methodist Church in Honolulu in 1903. In 1905, Hyun, Soon was appointed as a missionary to the farms on the island of Kauai at the request of Pastor Wadman. In this area, he preached the gospel to around 2,000 Korean immigrants, served as an interpreter, and helped mediate conflicts. The aforementioned first-generation leaders remained active in the Korean community's movements in Hawaii until the 1940s, and when Hyun Soon returned to Hawaii, they provided support and strength.\n\n[This part will be moved to 1911--1920 decade later.] Introducing the March 1st movement to other countries. In February 1919, as a result of the February 8th Declaration of Independence, which was led by Korean students studying in Tokyo, Hyun Soon, along with Christian leaders like Lee Seung-hoon, Ryu Jo-dae, Ham Tae-yong, and Shin Hong-sik, planned the March 1st Movement. At this time, he was appointed as a diplomatic envoy and headed to Shanghai with the aim of delivering a letter to President Woodrow Wilson, the advocate of national self-determination at the Paris Peace Conference. In the letter, he advocated for Korea's independence for global reform and the maintenance of peace in the East.\n\nFollowing the March 1st Movement, Korean independence activists gathered in Shanghai and established a temporary office on Bochang Road, which had been leased to France by China. Hyun, Soon was appointed as the secretary-general of this office. He played a crucial role in disseminating the plans and progress of the domestic March 1st Movement to compatriots both domestically and abroad, including in the United States and Canada, to foster unity within the independence movement and lay the foundation for the organization of the Shanghai Provisional Government. After the establishment of the Shanghai Provisional Government on April 10, 1919, he was successively appointed as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission. Additionally, he played a significant role in integrating various provisional governments that had sprung up in different locations, bringing Kim Seong-gyeom and Lee Dong-hwi into the fold. In 1920, he was appointed as the interim chairman of the North American Regional Committee and worked passionately, touring the United States for fundraising campaigns. However, a conflict with the Korean community arose over the establishment of the Korean Embassy in the United States, leading him to return to Shanghai.He was succeeded by Seo Jae-pil as the interim chairman.\n\nIn 1922, he returned as a pastor to the Korean Methodist Church in Honolulu. Drawing on his previous experience with immigration, he dedicated herself to serving Korean labor immigrants and Korean immigrants to Hawaii. He personally visited Korean households, learning about their situations and difficulties. He also participated in education for Koreans, actively contributing to the compilation of English language textbooks for the Korean department of the Methodist Church in the United States, starting in 1923. Additionally, he constructed dormitories for Korean leaders and Methodist Korean students. He also organized evening classes for teaching Chinese characters to Korean students to help them maintain their cultural identity.\n\nStarting in 1923, he also became involved in the independence movement of Korean immigrants in the United States. Hee had long envisioned Hawaii as a supply base for the independence movement and had plans to gather the hearts of Koreans living there, using the media to promote economic, educational, and propaganda activities to complete the \"Great Cause\" (대업). However, it seems he did not join major Korean organizations like the National Association (국민회) or the Association of Comrades (동지회) at that time. His standing within the Korean independence movement community decreased significantly due to the opening of the consulate in 1921 and the submission of the independence petition. Furthermore, he faced rejection from the Korean community and difficulty in developing independence movement plans within organizations influenced by Rhee, Syng-man’s authority. In this context, Hyun Soon began to participate in the \"Great Korean Independence Corps\" (대조선독립단) from 1923 onwards.\n\nThe Independence Corps, one of the two major forces leading the Korean community and in continuous competition with Rhee, Syng-man's faction since its formation in March 1919, provided Hyun, Soon with a political space where he could advance his own ideas for Hawaii's independence movement. Furthermore, it is evident from his strong criticism of Rhee, Syng-man’s delegate administration petition in the name of the \"33 Representatives of the Great Korean Independence Corps\" that he criticized Rhee, Syng-man's independence movement line within the Independence Corps. However, he continued her activities in the \"Supporting Committee for the Provisional Government\" (임시정부 후원회) from 1925, shifting his support towards the Provisional Government. At that time, Rhee, Syng-man was facing impeachment, and Hyun, Soon continued to raise independence movement funds, supporting Kim Gu. However, his active involvement in politics and fundraising created conflicts with the Methodist Church in the 1930s. Whether he had socialist tendencies within Christianity is a topic of debate among historians, but there is no clear evidence. However, he was enthusiastic about the establishment of a unified government through Christian reform. His contributions to the revival of the Korean Christian community and support for the independence movement are being reevaluated by more recent historians of Christian history.\n\n\n이덕주, “최병헌의 생애”, 탁사 최병헌의 목사의 생애와 신학, 정동삼문출판사, 2008, ㅔ. 42-45. \n\n김도훈.
