After the March 1st Movement, the Korean Government-General aimed to reduce the influence of religious groups as a key policy direction. However, due to the presence of foreign missionaries with ties to Western powers, especially the United States, they could not suppress Christianity forcefully. Therefore, the Korean Government-General had no choice but to weaken the influence of Christianity through a policy of conciliation rather than oppression. The primary target of this conciliation policy was the foreign missionaries who had a significant impact on nearly 90% of Christian believers. However, until 1920, the Korean Government-General had not established a harmonious relationship with foreign missionaries. At that time, foreign missionaries were dissatisfied with the religious policies of the Korean Government-General. In 1915, the Korean Government-General promulgated the Evangelization Regulations, which allowed them to control religion in Korea. These regulations, issued on August 16, 1915, required strict government approval for individuals, facilities, and activities related to religious evangelization. In other words, these regulations restricted any religious organization from engaging in evangelization activities freely without the approval of the Korean Government-General.\n\nAs restrictions on missionary activities increased through the Evangelization Regulations, the dissatisfaction of missionaries grew. This dissatisfaction was expressed during the All-Korea Missionaries Conference held in September 1919, attended by almost all missionary organizations active in Korea at that time. Foreign missionaries submitted a petition to the Korean Government-General during this conference, making suggestions in six areas. Their suggestions were mainly focused on relaxing excessive regulations on missionary activities and guaranteeing freedom for their evangelization efforts. The Korean Government-General began to quickly implement these demands made by foreign missionaries. By 1920, there were some relaxations in the Evangelization Regulations. The Korean Government-General significantly reduced the documentation required for government approval and eliminated fines for violations. While these amendments did not grant complete freedom, they represented a significant relaxation compared to previous restrictions. \n\nThrough the amendments to the Evangelization Regulations, the Korean Government-General partially eased the constraints on missionaries, leading to the approval of missionary organizations as foundations. Starting with the establishment of the Methodist Missionary Society on December 18, 1920, various Christian organizations established their own foundations, and the Korean Government-General granted approval to these foundations. Approval of foundations had long been a goal for Korean Christian organizations as it would legally recognize their rights over the properties they acquired. Thus, the Korean Government-General actively sought to align itself with foreign missionaries through policy changes. The Korean Government-General's active policy changes soon led to the expansion of Christianity. According to statistics from the Korean Government-General, the number of Christian believers, which was 296,487 at the end of 1919, increased to 323,574 by the end of 1920, representing an increase of 27,087 believers within a year. This trend of Christian growth continued beyond 1920. As the Korean Government-General's policies changed, the influence of foreign missionaries grew rapidly.\n\nInitially, foreign missionaries were hesitant to get deeply involved in sensitive political issues. The earlier mentioned dissatisfaction of missionaries primarily focused on the constraints on their missionary activities rather than outright opposition to Japanese rule in Korea. Therefore, when the Korean Government-General implemented more conciliatory policies, foreign missionaries also became more cooperative, aligning themselves with the Korean Government-General. As foreign missionaries gradually aligned with the Korean Government-General, the resentment of Koreans who had previously viewed them very favorably began to grow. Koreans' changing perceptions of foreign missionaries were particularly evident in the schools they operated. In October 1922, a boycott occurred at a private missionary school in Keijo (Seoul). Over 100 students, enrolled in regular and supplementary courses, went on strike, citing excessive oppression, authoritarian school management, and outdated education methods. The students were determined to continue the boycott, even if it meant expulsion.\n\nThe school administration responded harshly to the students' actions. On October 20, 1922, they expelled 30 students who had led the boycott and dismissed teachers who had supported the strike. They also sent most of the remaining students back to their hometowns. At that time, the situation was well understood by Samuel A. Moffett, who remarked, \"Those westerners who have been looking at Korea for thirty or forty years have given them the kind of education that was not appropriate for the times.\" In other words, this criticism attributed the causes of the incident to the foreign missionaries who managed the school. This indicates that Koreans were no longer viewing foreign missionaries in a purely positive light.\n\nThe incidents resulting from the racial and discriminatory prejudices of missionaries occurred consecutively, with the 'Hasymer Incident' being a prominent example. In 1925, C. A. Hasymer, a medical missionary affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, operated a hospital in Sunan, Pyeongan Province. That summer, a 12-year-old Korean child from the mission station ate apples from Hasymer's orchard and, as a form of punishment, Hasymer etched the word 'thief' onto the child's cheeks using nitric acid, leaving permanent scars. A year later, a Japanese prosecutor filed charges against Hasymer for this incident, leading to protests and condemnation from Korean Christian youth groups. Eventually, Hasymer was dismissed by the Adventist Church and deported in December of that year. The incident was reported as potentially being used by Japan to promote anti-missionary policies. Consequently, right-wing Japanese organizations began supporting anti-missionary movements. Similar incidents continued, and on December 28-29, 1925, J.R. Mott, the General Secretary of the YMCA, arrived in Seoul with the aim of resolving conflicts between missionaries and Koreans. A meeting called the 'Council of Korean Christian Workers' was held with representatives from both sides, consisting of 31 missionaries and 31 Koreans. This meeting served to ease tensions but also reignited discussions about the need for church reform. A. W. Wasson summarized that during this meeting, \"According to the request of Paul, who said 'be all things to all men,' the missionaries were asked to become more Korean.\" This conflict hindered the growth of the Korean church in the 1920s and 1930s, and the Japanese authorities used it as an excuse to promote anti-missionary policies. This ultimately paved the way for the merger of Korean Christianity with Japanese Christianity. \n\n한규무.
