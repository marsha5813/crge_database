Korean missionaries also initiated a joint movement, but the established Korean churches and their members, who were loyal to their denominations, did not actively respond to this movement. One reason for this was the significant loss of lives and property suffered by the Korean church during the March 1st Movement. Another reason was the failure of the joint church movement in 1905. However, this movement evolved into the \"Korean Church Federal Council\" (조선예수교장감연합협의회) in 1918. In 1924, it decided to merge with the Korean Missionary Association, forming the \"Korean National Christian Council\" (조선예수교연합공의회). The rules adopted at the founding meeting of the Council, with Rev. Chae Jae-myeong as the inaugural chairman, stated the organization's objectives as \"cooperatively promoting the spread of the gospel, the advancement of social ethics, and the dissemination of Christian culture.\"\n\n\nThis Korean National Christian Council can be considered the precursor to the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK). Initially, it had the participation of three Korean churches (Korean Presbyterian Church, Korean Methodist Church, and Korean Southern Presbyterian Church) and six foreign missionary boards, as well as two Christian organizations (British and Foreign Bible Society and Korean Christian Youth Association). The number of Korean representatives (40) surpassed that of missionaries (20), leading to the likelihood of Koreans gaining leadership within the organization. In response to this changing situation, missionaries continued the existence of the Korean Missionary Association, which they had planned to dissolve, to maintain their own separate forum.\n\n\nThe Korean National Christian Council organized mission fields and took over the missionary activities of the Korean Missionary Association in Japan and China. It also managed evangelists' training, rural work, temperance movements, and oversaw media broadcasting for evangelism. In 1921, it played a role in introducing global church trends to the domestic audience in connection with the establishment of the International Missionary Council (IMC) in 1921. In 1925, it actively arranged Dr. John R. Mott's visit to Korea as the president of the IMC. In 1928, it sent representatives to the International Missionary Council in Jerusalem, including Shin Hyung-woo, Yang Ju-sam, Jung In-gwa, and Kim Hwal-ran. This event became a decisive moment for shaping the social consciousness of Korean Christians and led the Korean church to strive for the \"socialization and realization of faith,\" working to reform Korean society and rural communities.\n\n\n임희국.

The YMCA's mission was to promote the intellectual, moral, and physical development of young people and played a role in gathering the scattered thoughts of students under Japanese rule. It also played a significant role in the establishment of the Korean Student Congress.\n\n\nThe Korean Student Congress aimed to avoid the fragmentation that had been seen in previous student activities, such as alumni associations or social clubs, and instead emerged as a consolidated body representing the student community, engaging in multifaceted activities. However, the Japanese authorities did not permit this movement. In 1922, amid the rise of anti-Christian sentiment, the 11th World Student Christian Federation Conference was held in Beijing. Students resolved to combine religion and science in their minds to innovate themselves, reform society, and ultimately eliminate social evils such as poverty and establish true peace based on justice and human equality. The \"Buy-Korean\" campaign was also discussed within the YMCA, and socialist ideas gained prominence. In line with the concept of global reform in the context of civilization and strength not being determined by material standards but by the principles of humanity and justice, the idea of reforming the world was advocated.\n\n\nOn the other hand, discussions within the YMCA student body began to focus on the alliance between socialism and Christianity, as an extension of the theory of global reform. In August 1924, during the 10th Student Congress held in Gaecheon, Chaehadong, the resolution stated that the Student YMCA would carry out the temperance movement, campaign against prostitution, promote thriftiness, and encourage agriculture. This resolution was in line with the concurrent movements for industrial development and temperance. However, in October 1925, as socialist activists intensified their anti-Christian movements, some voices within the Student YMCA shifted their focus toward emphasizing the identity of Christianity, moving away from advocating Christian-socialist alliances.\n\nRural enlightenment movement:  The rural activities of the Student YMCA expanded their scope from initially focusing on basic education to activities such as cooperative association organization, agricultural improvement, and promoting supplementary livelihoods after 1929. These activities were divided into two main categories: during vacation and during the semester.\n\nDuring the vacation period, activities included sending lecture teams to address illiteracy, organizing training sessions, operating children's Bible schools, and rural night schools. These activities aimed to combat illiteracy, lead cooperative associations, promote hygiene awareness, and raise awareness for improved living conditions.\n\nFor instance, the Yeonhee College Student YMCA sent a missionary team to places like Gangneung, Geumcheon, Yonggang, and Ui-ju for a week starting on December 27, 1928. They focused on three major activities: faith issues, the Buy-Korean movement, and rural development, illustrating the multifaceted nature of their activities.\n\nAdditionally, during vacations, regular missionary teams were sent to various regions for rural development activities. As the Chosun Ilbo's literacy campaign (1929-1934) and Dong-a Ilbo's broadcasting campaign (1931-1934) unfolded, using the vacation period for rural enlightenment activities became a common sight in the daily life of students.\n\n\nTable.

The rural activities of the Student YMCA expanded their focus from basic education in the early days to include cooperative association organization, agricultural improvement, and support for supplementary livelihoods after 1929. These activities were broadly categorized into two phases: during vacation and during the semester.\n\nDuring the vacation period, activities included sending lecture teams, organizing training sessions, running children's Bible schools, and rural night schools. These activities aimed to combat illiteracy, provide guidance for cooperative associations, promote hygiene awareness, and raise awareness for improved living conditions. An example of this is the Yeonhee College Student YMCA, which, from December 27, 1928, for one week, dispatched missionary teams to various locations such as Gangneung, Geumcheon, Yonggang, and Ui-ju. They focused on three major activities: addressing faith issues, promoting the Buy-Korean movement, and engaging in rural development activities.\n\nFurthermore, in response to the arrival of the vacation period, they began regularly sending missionary teams to various regions. This culminated in the establishment of the Student YM-YWCA Joint Meeting, which included representatives from 10 male and 10 female schools, and the organization of a Presidents' Leadership Meeting, marking the beginning of their collaborative efforts.\n\nThe joint activities of the Student YM-YWCA took a new turn in August 1927, when they held the First Korean Men's and Women's Student Christian Youth Association Joint Leadership Conference at the residence of Min Young-chan in Seongbuk-dong, Dongso-mun outside of Seoul. This event brought together 76 male and 45 female students from 28 schools, with a total of 121 participants. They engaged in various activities, including lectures and free discussions on topics such as religion and national identity, Christianity and daily life, the determination of modern youth, Christian non-resistance, and rural development, all under the slogan \"Let's Move Forward.\" However, in September 1931, when the Manchurian Incident occurred, the collaborative activities of the student federation faced an unexpected setback. Due to restrictions imposed by the Japanese colonial government on the activities of public organizations, not only social activities but also the proper organization of joint leadership meetings became increasingly challenging.\n\nNevertheless, these various alliances played a significant role in the development of the Gwangju Student Movement in 1929. \n\n\n장규식.

After 1910, many Koreans who had immigrated to China or sought refuge there due to various political, economic, and religious pressures, including the incident involving 105 officials of the Chosun Governor-General's Office, began to increase. According to statistics published in 1921, there were approximately 49,771 Korean immigrants in Manchuria. Since Japan did not permit study abroad in the United States, Korean youth preparing for overseas education also made preparations in China. During this period, China was a battleground for various world powers, and Shanghai, in particular, was the largest international city in Asia. Koreans formed Christian communities with the help of missionaries from various countries around the world. Western political and economic forces concentrated in Shanghai conveyed Woodrow Wilson's principle of self-determination to the members of the New Korea Young Men Association, who in turn propagated it within Korea. Therefore, the New Korea Young Men Association was organized to send representatives to international conferences to appeal for Korea's independence in accordance with the changing global situation.\n\nIndependence Petition. The primary activities of the New Korea Young Men Association (신한청년단) included drafting an independence petition and attempting to deliver it to President Wilson of the United States, as well as sending Kim Kyu-sik as a representative to the Paris Peace Conference. Many domestic papers have overlooked the Christian nature of this organization, but their Christian spirit is evident in the independence petition. Written primarily by Yun Chi-ho, the introduction argued that the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations should discuss the customs of Korea and Japan in accordance with Wilson's principle of self-determination. Japan was criticized for revering military personnel over scholars, acknowledging the Emperor's divine authority, and demanding unquestioning obedience, making it unfit for membership in the League of Nations. It was also suggested that Japan would not hesitate to go to war not only in Asia but also against the United States, posing a threat to world peace. In contrast, Korea, the original Great Empire that succeeded Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, was described as having lost its country to Japan despite its Hongik Ingan (Benefit All Humanity) spirit passing through the ages. Japan's persecution of Korea was first discussed in terms of mental oppression. Japan considered Christianity the biggest obstacle to its rule over Chosun, and thus, it imposed Confucianism, Buddhism, and other religions. Furthermore, it suppressed education, economic activities, political freedom, and freedom of the press while hindering Korea's development. Secondly, Japan's rule through the Hyeonbyeong Police took away property rights and parliamentary debate rights. Thirdly, Japan strictly controlled the economic activities of Koreans, confiscated farmland, and took away resources, making it impossible for Koreans to make a living.\n\nChristian nationalism. The historical significance of the New Korea Young Men Association can be seen in the shift in the goals of the independence movement. Previously, the goal was to establish Emperor Gojong and reclaim Joseon, but now the aim was to establish a democratic nation centered around the United States. Secondly, the Christian-dominated independence movement shifted from being religion-centered to being Christian-centered. Finally, Christianity became the new spiritual model for the nation. Their most important achievement was providing financial and human resources to Korea before the March 1st Movement. As a result, Shanghai is recognized as the birthplace of the March 1st Movement and the center of the independence movement, with the New Korea Young Men Association being credited for its promotion. These individuals became key figures in the provisional government, so the relationship between Christianity and the Shanghai Provisional Government had been planned even before its establishment.\n\n\n이규수.

Between 1907 and 1910, approximately 10,000 people immigrated to Gando each year, and the Korean immigrant population in the Yanbian region, which was 30,000 in 1897, reached 60,000 in 1911.\n\n\nThe Korean Migration in 1910-1930 (Adapted from the High School History Textbook published by Kumsung Publishing, Korea. \n\n\nManchuria and Siberia, also known as the starting point of the March 1st Movement, later became hubs for the independence movement. Apart from the fact that many prominent ethnic leaders in the region of Manchuria and Siberia were Christians, it is significant that, both before and after the March 1st Movement, Christian churches, schools, and church local organizations were often used as points of contact and activity bases for the independence movement.\n\nThe Manchuria region can be divided into three main areas: the southern Manchuria region, centered around Bongcheon and Honggyeong; the eastern Manchuria (Gando) region, centered around Yeongil and Huncheon; and the northern Manchuria region, centered around Gilim, Singyeong, and Harbin. In southern Manchuria, the Presbyterian Church of Pyeongbuk Province and the Presbyterian Church in North America mission departments were primarily involved. In eastern Manchuria, the Presbyterian Church of Hamgyeong Province and the Presbyterian Church in Canada mission departments played a significant role. In northern Manchuria, the Methodist Episcopal Church mission department and the Korean Evangelical Holiness Church were mainly responsible.\n\n\nThe first Presbyterian church in South Manchuria was the Lee Yang-ja Church established in Juean County in 1898. In 1900, the church was destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion, causing great suffering to its members. The following year, missionaries N.C. Whittemore and Ahn, Seung-won were sent to console the congregation and rebuild the church, marking a significant milestone in Korean church missionary work in the South Manchuria region. Around the same time, the Korean Mission of the Northern Presbyterian Church received a request from the Scottish Presbyterian Church Mission for Korean missionaries to be responsible for Korean missionary work in Manchuria. As a result, the Northern Presbyterian Church Mission began sending Korean evangelists in 1901. With the growth of churches in the Manchuria region, the South Manchuria (Namman) Synod was organized on April 21, 1921. The South Manchuria Presbytery also expanded its missionary activities in the region, sending Korean missionaries in 1922 and 1923, who worked throughout Manchuria. However, during this time, they faced challenges due to the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, attacks by bandits, increased surveillance, and oppression by Japan, particularly after the March 1st Movement.\n\nDespite these difficulties, missionary work in the Manchuria region, led by the South Manchuria synod, achieved significant milestones, including the establishment of the Bongcheonho synod in 1936-5 and the Yonggu synod in 1937. Here are the church statistics for the South Manchuria Presbytery from 1921 to 1930.\n\n| Year | Church | NA | NA | Christians | NA | Pastor | Budget(KW) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | Organi-zation | Unorga-nized | Prayer Center | Baptized | Total | NA | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1924 | 19 | 25 | 90 | 2,192 | 4,790 | 5 | 20,493.34 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1925 | 15 | 25 | 43 | 2,387 | 5,136 | 7 | 22,266.57 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1926 | 20 | 34 | 90 | 3,012 | 5,992 | 8 | 20,730.45 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | 16 | 20 | 54 | 2,113 | 3,250 | 12 | 38,153.95 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1928 | 23 | 20 | 52 | 2,766 | 5,415 | 12 | 17,375.00 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1929 | 21 | 38 | 59 | 2,993 | 5,078 | 12 | 14,850.48 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 18 | 38 | 56 | 2,116 | 3,935 | 10 | 20,204.56 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nAdapted by “The History of Christianity in Korea 2,” (2021). p. 119. The Institute of the History of Christianity in Korea. \n\n\nMission to Siberia. It began in 1909 when Pastor Choi Gwan-heum was sent by the Independent Korean Presbyterian Church. After the March 1st Movement, the number of immigrants to the Siberian region increased, and by 1921, there were 32 churches and 1,763 church members. In 1922, there was explosive growth, thanks to the revival led by Pastor Kim Ik-du, leading to the organization of the Siberian Presbytery in 1922. However, due to the Communist Revolution, Pastor Kwon Seung-kyung was arrested and sentenced to death in 1924, and in 1925, the Presbytery was dissolved. Afterward, the South Manchuria Presbytery and the Hamgyeong Presbytery jointly managed this region. In 1929, with a report of 8 churches and over 900 believers, the Siberian mission effectively came to an end.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church's mission in Eastern Manchuria, often referred to as Gando or North Gando, was initiated by the Canadian Presbyterian Mission Board. In 1906, a Chinese church member named Dan Geum, who was in Yongjeong (Longjing, 龍井), came to Wonsan and purchased Christian books to support Korean evangelism in Gando. When this became known, Korean churches started showing interest in missionary work in the Kando region. In 1908, the South Methodist Church dispatched Missionary Lee, Hwa Chun, and in 1907, the Waryongdong Church was established. In 1909, the Myeongdong Church was founded through the efforts of Koreans who had sought refuge in Gando due to their involvement in nationalist activities, such as Kim, Yak-yeon, Kim, Jeong-gyu, Kim, Ha-gyu, Moon, Jeong-ho, Moon, Chi-jeong, and Choi, Bong-gi. In 1908, the Myeongdong (明東) School was established, and the invitation of Christian from Pyeongan Province, Jung, Jae-myeon, as a teacher, served as a catalyst for mass conversion and the establishment of churches. Following explosive growth, by 1911, 24 churches were established.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the South Methodist Mission and the Canadian Presbyterian Mission, which had started missionary work in Kando, reached an agreement in 1909 to allow South Methodist Church to relinquish the Gando region in exchange for the Canadian Presbyterian Mission's territory within Gangwon Province. Subsequently, with significant development, Gando became the cradle of the nationalist movement, especially after the arrival of Yi, Dong-hwi in 1914, who was an exile from Kando, and as nationalist activists continued to join the movement.\n\nOrganizations such as the Yanbian Churchmen's Association (1907) and the National Association brought together community members where Christian leaders gathered to engage in anti-Japanese nationalist and enlightenment activities. Following the March 1st Movement and severe suppression by the Japanese, the churches in the Gando region suffered greatly. Despite this persecution, they established the Gando Synod and, on December 1, 1921, gained independence from the Hamgyeong Synod. In 1925, they changed their name to the Eastern Manchuria Synod. The status of the church is as follows:\n\n| Year | Church | NA | NA | Christians | NA | Pastor | Budget(KW) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | Organi-zation | Unorga-nized | Prayer Center | Baptized | Total | NA | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1922 | 30 | 57 | 28 | 1,961 | 3,392 | 6 | 34,215.86 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1923 | 39 | 44 | 44 | 1,858 | 5,866 | 6 | 46,203.71 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1924 | 28 | 47 | 35 | 2,126 | 6,271 | 6 | 57,997.53 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1925 | 26 | 80 | 49 | 2,017 | 6,049 | 6 | 29,627.60 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1926 | 33 | 76 | 26 | 2,768 | 6,130 | 6 | 37,871.67 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | 38 | 83 | 61 | 2,315 | 5,891 | 9 | 32,841.82 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1928 | 34 | 74 | 68 | 2,241 | 6,094 | 10 | 30,937.78 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1929 | 35 | 55 | 61 | 2,215 | 4,749 | 9 | 26,098.80 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 35 | 54 | 66 | 1,968 | 4,866 | 12 | 34,173.79 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nAdapted by “The History of Christianity in Korea 2,” (2021). p. 124.

Black, and others from the Canadian Presbyterian Mission resided and conducted their activities. Missionary institutions operated by the mission, such as Eunjin Middle School in Yongjeong, Myeongshin Women's School, and the Jechang Hospital, left a positive impression on the Korean community in the Gando region. In particular, the founder of the Jechang Hospital, S. H. Martin, devotedly treated Koreans injured in the March 1st Movement and provided support for Korea's independence movement, contributing to a favorable perception of Koreans by offering assistance.\n\nThe Northern Manchuria Mission of the Methodist Church. Before 1930, the Methodist Church of the United States and the Southern Methodist Church of the United States conducted separate missionary efforts. In 1910, Pastor So Jeong-do settled in Harbin, but he was dedicated to the independence movement, including the establishment of the Sinheung Military School, and was arrested. In 1918, he was again sent as a missionary to Manchuria. Around 1921, churches were established in Changchun and Harbin, and several prayer places or chapels were founded. There were reported to be 158 baptized members and a total of 481 church members. In 1923, with the inclusion of the Gilimseong 吉林省region, which was under the administration of the Southern Methodist Church, it experienced growth. From 1923 onwards, it showed even greater growth. The activities of women cannot be overlooked. In 1924, Korean missionary Yang, Woo-rodeoree (梁雨路德) was sent as a missionary. She departed for Manchuria in January 1925 and worked in Harbin, with female missionaries like Nam, Gyeong-soon and Yi, Bae-se participating actively in missionary work until the late 1930s.\n\n| Year | Church | NA | Christians | NA | Pastors | NA | Budget |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | Church | Prayer C | Baptized | Total | Pastor | Assistant | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1923 |  |  | 463 | 1,353 | 2 | 6 | 2,525 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1924 | 18 | 10 | 411 | 1,159 | 4 | 5 | 4,987 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1925 | 19 | 7 | 456 | 1,365 | 4 | 2 | 8,845 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1926 | 17 | 11 | 489 | 1,440 | 4 | 2 | 12,167 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | 19 | 15 | 538 | 1,465 | 4 | - | 9,962 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1928 | 15 | 20 | 475 | 1,302 | 4 | - | 4,333 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1929 | 8 | 10 | 355 | 1,150 | 3 | - | 2,878 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 11 | 6 | 445 | 1,340 | 5 | - | 2,493 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nAdapted by “The History of Christianity in Korea 2,” (2021). p. 126. The Institute of the History of Christianity in Korea. \n\n\nAs the United Methodist Church intensified its missionary activities in the Northern Manchuria region, there were instances of overlap with other denominational missionary efforts. Due to significant overlapping areas with the North Presbyterian Church, in 1924, the \"Presbyterian and Methodist Joint Committee on Missionary Work\" was established. They divided the region along the railway connecting Bongcheon, Changchun, and Harbin. The northwestern part was assigned to the United Methodist Church, while the southeastern part was entrusted to the North Presbyterian Church. In this context, it becomes evident that the missionary division agreements that were applied within Korea were also applied here.\n\nMissionary work in Shandong, China by Korean churches was the first instance of Koreans going abroad for missionary purposes. In 1912, through discussions with the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea, Park Tae-ro and Kim Chan-sung, pastors from Jaeryeong, were sent to Shandong to investigate potential mission sites with the aim of obtaining a \"missionary permit.\" In 1913, the General Assembly officially dispatched Kim Young-hoon, Park Tae-ro, and Sa Byung-soon as missionaries. The General Assembly also decided that \"missionaries should not establish independent churches but collaborate with the local presbytery in that region\" (Records of the First General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea, 1912).\n\nIn 1916, Korean missionaries were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Chinese church. This demonstrated the willingness to affiliate newly established churches in Shandong with the Chinese church, rather than the Korean church. Missionaries sent from Korea were re-affiliated with the Chinese church, and their authority in Korea was limited to that of advisors. This decision was made in consideration of the strong relationships with local Chinese churches and the convenience of missionary work in China.\n\nAfter only three years of missionary work in Shandong, 28 baptisms had taken place, six prayer meeting groups were established, and three schools for Chinese students were founded (Korean Church History Vol. 2, p. 141). However, due to health reasons, the three missionaries returned, and new missionaries were dispatched. In 1923, Dr. Joo Hyeon-cheok, a native of Suncheon, joined the mission and opened a hospital in Jimo.\n\nThere are two methods of evangelism targeted towards Chinese people. The first method is called \"House Church Evangelism 座堂傳道,\" where a house is purchased in a specific location and named the \"Gospel Hall.\" In this place, evangelistic materials and worship facilities are provided. The second method is known as \"Itinerant Evangelism 遊行傳道,\" where a \"Gospel Team\" is organized, carrying tents and equipment as they travel to spread the message. Itinerant evangelism was quite effective, and according to a report in 1928, these teams visited 107 regions, reaching over 50,000 people. They also sold 4,700 copies of the Gospel, resulting in 99 new converts in a year (Korean Christian History, p. 142).\n\n\nThanks to these efforts, the Shandong mission experienced explosive growth within just ten years. Behind this growth, there was active support from Christians in Pyongyang. The growth of churches, congregations, and schools in the Shandong region is as follows:\n\n| Year | Church | NA | Christians | NA | NA | School | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | Church | Place of worship | Baptized for the year | Baptized | Total Registered | School | Student |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | 1 |  | 3 | 12 | 40 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1916 | 1 |  |  | 12 | 40 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1917 | 1 | 6 | 9 | 28 | 50 | 3 | 32 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1918 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 32 | 85 | 3 | 31 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1919 | 2 | 6 | 19 | 49 | 89 | 3 | 35 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1920 | 10 | 8 | 41 | 416 | 520 | 11 | 176 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1921 | 10 | 21 | 31 | 431 | 617 | 13 | 269 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1922 | 9 | 25 | 34 | 494 | 746 | 11 | 289 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1923 | 10 | 25 | 58 | 591 | 815 | 19 | 435 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1924 | 12 | 30 | 26 | 585 | 818 | 13 | 358 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1925 | 12 | 27 | 43 | 652 | 823 | 12 | 315 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1926 | 11 | 26 | 55 | 720 | 884 | 15 | 435 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | 13 | 20 | 42 | 798 | 971 | 12 | 281 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1928 | 13 | 20 | 52 | 898 | 1006 | 12 | 242 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1929 | 15 | 30 | 48 | 902 | 1123 | 9 | 181 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 15 | 34 | 60 | 970 | 1207 | 7 | 160 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1931 | 15 | 36 | 34 | 1004 | 1308 | 6 | 139 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1932 | 16 | 35 | 70 | 1021 | 1292 | 7 | 150 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1933 | 17 | 30 | 73 | 1041 | 1324 | 7 | 169 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1934 | 19 | 30 | 73 | 1090 | 1416 | 9 | 190 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1935 | 21 | 30 | 38 | 1073 | 1400 | 6 | 153 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1936 | 21 | 32 | 31 | 1088 | 1398 | 4 | 107 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1938 |  | 36* | 11 |  | 1352 | 1 | 25 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1939 | 19 | 13 | 37 | 1160 | 1479 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1940 |  | 33* | 61 |  | 1569 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1941 |  | 34* | 116 |  | 1662 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1942 |  | 35* | 101 |  | 1716 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n*Church + Place of worship\n\nIn the table, churches rapidly increased in the early 1920s, and schools also saw growth during the 1920s. However, the growth of both churches and schools was not observed after 1938.During the period of political and social turmoil, including the Mukden Incident in Manchuria in 1931, the Shanghai Incident in 1932, and the large-scale anti-Japanese resistance by Chinese people leading up to the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Korean missionaries and churches found themselves in a peculiar position between the Chinese and the invading Japanese. The resentment held by Chinese people towards Korean missionaries and Korean churches was one significant factor.\n\nIn the 1930s, as the Communist Party gained dominance in its struggle against the Nationalist government, a prevailing atmosphere of anti-religion and anti-Christian sentiment in China led to attacks on Korean churches. From the Chinese perspective, the activities of Korean missionaries could be interpreted as an extension of Japan's aggression in China. As a result, starting from the 1930s, the Shandong mission was gradually brought to a halt.\n\n\n ",
