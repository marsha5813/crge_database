(?)\n\nEducation: He didn’t receive any educational degree from the Westernized institutions, but he was a profound scholar in Chinese literature. Although he failed the civil service exam at the Joseon government multiple times, Henry Appenzeller, who was the prominent methodist missionary in Korea, invited him to Bai-jae school as a teacher of Chinese classics. Appenzeller introduced him to Christianity, and guided him to become a pastor.   \n\nContributions: Choi, Byung-hun is a pastor, scholar in Chinese literature, teacher, and literary independent movement activist. Particularly, he developed a theoretical platform of Korean-indigenized Christianity based on his profound knowledge of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. He is a pioneer of comparative study of religion and dialectic of Christianity in Korea. His first article, 예수텬쥬량교변론耶穌天主兩敎辯論 was published in 1908 and a collection of his writings, The World of Religion (만종일련 萬宗一臠) and 한철집요 漢哲輯要 were published in 1922. As the literary mission work was proliferated in  1920s, I would like to put his contributions in this decade. \n\nPromoting the Literary Mission of the Protestant Church, Especially Among Intellectuals: Choi's upbringing was steeped in Chinese literature, and he made three attempts to pass the civil service exam (Gwagoe) without success. Subsequently, he assumed the role of a tutor for Korean language instruction under the American Methodist missionary George Heber Jones. Later, he was invited to teach at the Bai-jae school by Appenzeller. During this period, Western missionaries were often viewed as foreign entities, colloquially known as \"Western ghosts,\" who allegedly harmed infants, an incident referred to as the \"baby riot\" in Pyongyang in 1988.\n\nHowever, Choi took a different approach. He observed how Western missionaries earnestly endeavored to alleviate poverty and despair among the Joseon people. Drawing upon his knowledge of Confucianism within the Korean context, Choi sought to comprehend Christianity and the missionaries. Lee Deok-ju (2008) explained Choi's conversion, attributing it to his concerns about a corrupt government and its uncertain future, his admiration for Western missionaries' efforts to improve the lives of ordinary Joseon citizens, and his perception of Christianity as a vehicle for modernizing Joseon. Choi was baptized by Jones and later served as an assistant pastor at Jeondong-Jaeil Church in Seoul. He became the first Korean pastor at Jeongdong-Jaeil Church after the tragic drowning of Appenzeller, who had heroically saved a girl's life. Choi also maintained a concurrent role as a civil service worker in the Joseon government, which enabled him to advocate for the cessation of military actions by righteous military groups.\n\nChoi's involvement in promoting the enlightenment movement in rural areas sparked controversy among contemporary historians, who debated the true nature of his contributions. Regardless of his political entanglements, Choi authored \"Seong-san-Yu-Rm-Gi,\" a serialized novel exploring Christianity and existing religions. These writings were published in the \"Biblical and Church Monthly,\" known as \"Shin-hak-wol-bo.\" A compilation of his work was released as \"Seong-san-myeong-gyeong\" in 1912. This novel marked the first dialectic Christian text challenging native religions. Through his publications employing dialectic approaches, Choi portrayed Christianity as an extension of Korean culture and its native religions, rather than a foreign import. Some scholars have even attributed the lyrics of the Korean national anthem to Choi, in collaboration with Yun Chi-ho and Ahn Chang-ho (Kim, 2021; Park, 2015). If this is indeed the case, the anthem serves as a prime example of his indigenized theology.\n\nChoi's insights and direction resonated with intellectuals who grappled with conflicting ideologies and the need to navigate their own paths to salvation and national betterment. Additionally, Choi actively participated in the Independence Club and contributed to the Independence Newspaper. He also played a pivotal role in assisting Jones in the publication of an English-Korean dictionary in 1914. Jones acknowledged Choi's significant contributions in accurately translating adjectives between the two languages and finding suitable vocabulary, crucial as an increasing number of Western terms found their way into Joseon.\n\nFurthermore, Choi played a vital role in preserving the Korean language, Hangul, during the colonial era. Alongside Bible translations, he published \"Je-guk-shin-mun\" in Korean and served as an editor. He also published the \"Biblical and Church Monthly,\" \"Shin-hak-wol-bo,\" in Korean (Park, 1997). Choi's publications have greatly enriched the understanding of Christianity and the church in the context of existing Korean religions and culture, earning admiration from many intellectuals who aspired to rescue Joseon during that period. These thoughts later influenced theologians and church activists in shaping Christianity and the church within the Korean context.\n\nFacilitating Indigenous Theology: Choi's book, \"The World of Religion\" (만종일련 萬宗一臠), initiated a comparative study of religions. It encompassed major world religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism (선교), Islam, Hinduism, as well as new religions like Tenrikyo 天理教 and Gyeongcheon-gyo 敬天敎, offering a rationale for Christianity. Choi contended that within the broader context of the World of Religion, Confucianism posits that a virtuous person is akin to heaven, and it should not be regarded solely as a monotheistic belief but also as a polytheistic faith encompassing ancestral rites, earthly deities, and mountain spirits.\n\nHe further articulated that the afterlife held no promise in Buddhism, critiquing it for its passivity concerning social service and societal change. Choi's overarching point was that it wasn't a matter of Confucianism, Buddhism, or Daoism being inherently wrong; instead, he argued that the truths of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism had been realized within Christianity. Christians, he noted, also maintained the doctrine of being reborn in Christ. Kim Kwang-sik summarized Choi's perspective as follows: \"True Christianity doesn't revolve around metaphysical truths or the expansion of worldly power, and its authenticity isn't determined by the display of miracles. Rather, the essence of Christianity lies in the salvation of humanity\" (p. 138-139).\n\nChoi's inclusive approach of embracing other religions rather than rejecting them garnered respect within the Korean Christian community, both in his era and continues to be a subject of debate to this day.\n\n\nKim, Maria. 김마리아 金瑪利亞\n\nBirth/Death: 1892/06/18 (Hwanghae-do, Jangyeon) ~ 1944/03/23 (Hamgyeongnam-do, Wonsan)\n\nEducation: Kim Maria was born into an affluent Christian household. Her father converted to Christianity early on and even established an elementary school in their hometown. Many of her relatives were independence activists who worked in the provisional government. Kim Maria graduated from Jeong-Shin Girls’ School where emphasized nurturing Korean women leaders, not Americanized women education. She was inspired by Shin, Maria (1873-1921), a vice-principal who taught that God’s kids must love our nation and neighbors, and become ‘a grain of wheat’ of the world. Kim went to Severance hospital to take care wound righteous army and indigenous people who participated in the protest against King Go-jong’s abdication. Later, she went on to study abroad at Do-kyo Women's College in 1914. Later, in 1923, she pursued further studies in the United States, earning a master's degree from Park College and the University of Chicago. Subsequently, she obtained a doctorate in theology from the Theological Seminary School of New York.\n\nContributions: Her contribution was found in developing women-centered organizations in Japan, the U.S., and Korea for facilitating women’s liberation movement and independent movement. I will focus on her leadership of Korean Patriotic Women’s Association (KPWA) and Gen-hwa-hoe 槿花會 in 1920s. (I will put her work between 1917 and 1919 here and separate it into 1910s later.)\n\nTokyo Korean Women Student Council 東京女子留學生親睦會. In the 1910s, Kim, Maria studied abroad in Japan, where there was an average of 5-600 Korean students (National Institute of Korean History). They organized the Korean Student Association and published a magazine called 'Lux Scientiae' twice a year. In addition to the male-dominated Korean Student Association, female students, led by Kim Pil-rye, organized the Tokyo Women's Student Friendship Association in 1915. Kim Maria was elected as the second president in 1916 and founded a magazine called 'Women's World' in 1917. This was the first magazine published by and for women during the Japanese colonial period and received a significant response both domestically and internationally. Under Kim Maria's leadership, the Tokyo Women's Student Friendship Association became widely known among Japanese students studying abroad and became a center for women's and independence movements. Influential female students of the time, such as Na Hye-seok and Hwang Esther, joined, further enhancing its reputation. In 1919, they also participated in the March 1st Independence Movement, contributing 30 won to the independence fund. However, among the 11 signatories of the February 8th Independence Declaration, there were no women, and Kim Maria returned to Korea, struggling with the direction of the women's movement. At this time, what's important to note is that she copied the March 1st Independence Declaration and concealed it in her belt as she returned to Korea. She returned to Korea and conveyed news of the March 1st Movement. She actively participated in the pre-movement activities for the March 1st Movement in Daegu, Gwangju, Seoul, and her hometown, Hwanghae Province. At a meeting on March 2nd, she passionately encouraged student participation, saying, \"Yesterday marked the beginning of Korea's independence movement. Since male students are actively involved, we women cannot just stand by and watch. Female students must also participate in the movement.\" On March 5th, she was arrested by Japanese military police but was released on August 5th after enduring harsh treatment. She later became a faculty member at her alma mater, Jeongshin Women's School.\n\nKorean Patriotic Women’s Association (KPWA), 대한민국애국부인회, 1919. On October 19, 1919, Kim Maria founded the Korean Patriotic Women's Association at the home of Lillian Dean Miller, who was working as a teacher at Jeongshin Women's School. This organization was formed by merging two existing groups: the \"Blood Loyalty Women's Patriotic Association,\" which was organized to support the Provisional Government, and the \"Greater Korea Independence Women's Patriotic Association,\" which was organized without the knowledge of the Provisional Government but shared the same goals.\n\nKim Maria stated, \"Our women must engage in the independence movement as passionately as men. Fortunately, Oh Hyun-joo has organized the Women's Association as its president and has been pushing for independence. However, this association had only a few members from Korea. This time, let's establish branches in each region of Korea and recruit members widely so that women across the nation can work for independence. What do you think about that?\"\n\nThis represented a call for equal participation of men and women in the independence movement, setting a different standard from the traditional passive and supportive role of women in anti-Japanese activities. Article 2 of their rules stated, \"The purpose of this association is to promote the Constitution of the Republic of Korea,\" implying that women also fulfill their obligations as citizens.\n\nKim Maria abandoned the previous localized and limited organizational structure and expanded the association nationwide, establishing branches in North Korea, Jeju Island, and even Hawaii. She sent the rules of the Korean Patriotic Women's Association along with 2,000 won to Lee Seung-man, who was the president of the Provisional Government at the time.\n\nIn November 1919, she, along with other key members, was arrested again by Japanese military police. Missionary L.D. Miller, Dr. F.W. Schofield, and Pastor W.N. Blair applied for her release, citing her harsh torture, and on May 22, 1920, she was granted her freedom.\n\nFemale Independence Work at the Provisional Government. The incident of her seeking asylum in China on July 21, 1921, shocked the Japanese government. At that time, there was a deep conflict between factions within the independence movement. On one side, there was the \"Creation Party\" that strongly opposed Lee Seung-man's Provisional Government, and on the other side, there was the \"Reform Party\" that recognized the authority of the Provisional Government and aimed to bring about reforms. In an attempt to resolve this conflict, a National Representatives' Conference was convened on January 31, 1923. Kim Maria reported on the activities of the Korean Patriotic Women's Association. Her strong belief in saving the country through education led her to enroll at the Bible Teacher Training School in Nanjing (now Nanjing Normal University) to pursue further studies. Even there, she organized the \"Korean Young Women's Association\" in 1923, rallying the strength of female students.  \n\nGeunhwahoe (Korean Patriotic Women’s Association (KPWA) of the U.S.). With a determination for independence through education, she left for the United States. After graduating from Park College and relocating to New York, she discovered that the New York Korean community's organization called the \"Dongjihoi,\" which was set up to publish the March 1st newspaper, did not include women. At that time, prominent figures in the Korean and Chinese independence movements such as Park In-deok, Hwang Esther, and Jeong Ae-kyung were in New York. Together with them, she organized the \"Geunhwahoe\" in 1928, with \"Geunhwa\" symbolizing the Korean national flower, the rose of Sharon.\n\nThe purposes of Geunhwahoe were as follows: first, to instill a national spirit to promote unity among Koreans; second, to encourage education and vocational training; third, to widely publicize the colonial situation in Korea to the world; and fourth, to provide support for the establishment of a new country. They also established various branches such as the Unemployment Division, Education Division, and Social Division to carry out organized independence activities.\n\n\"...Our goal is not to advocate nationalism, which may seem outdated or irrelevant to some, or which some may think of as advocating for patriotism. We all have a sense of patriotism in various cases. However, when we are deeply involved in something, the love for our nation, the most important element among all, often fades, and we may not even know what we are advocating for. That's why we aim to further nurture the love for our nation.\" (Shinhanminbo, 1928.04.05. cited by Lee, 2020, p. 36). \n\nLater, news arrived that Chinese officials in Manchuria were issuing orders against Korean expatriates and engaging in abuse. In response, the Dongjihoi New York branch, the New York Korean Residents Association, the National Association of New York, and Geunhwahoe united to form the \"New York Korean Expatriate Advocacy Association\" and carried out activities to support Korean expatriates. Kim Maria participated in this effort as the president of Geunhwahoe.\n\nAt the time, although interactions among Korean expatriates in New York were frequent, most of them stayed temporarily for labor or education and then left for other places, resulting in a small permanent population. Many of the executives of Geunhwahoe were also in an unstable student status, so the organization's activities were not sustained consistently. Nonetheless, Geunhwahoe holds significant importance as an organization formed by Korean women living abroad in colonial Korea, who persevered in supporting their homeland's liberation despite the challenges. Kim Maria's unwavering determination for independence, even amidst the hardships of her student life in a foreign country, led her to organize and actively engage in a women's anti-Japanese movement organization.\n\n\n3) Lee, Sang-jae 이상재 李商在\n\nBirth/Death: 1850/10/26 (Choongcheong-do, Hansan-myeon) ~ 1927/03/29 (Seoul)\n\nEducation: Lee studied Chinese literature and served as a public officer in the Joseon dynasty and the Korean Empire. He was a supporter and member of the Enlightenment Party during the Gapshin Coup (1884) and the Gob-o Revolution (1894-1895). He converted while in jail in 1902, as a result of his involvement in the Independence Club and Manmingongdong-hoe incident. Rhee Syngman, who was also incarcerated, gave him the Bible, and Lee was deeply impressed by Matthew's \"Love your enemy.\" Many independence movement activists, such as Kim Jeong-sik, Yoo Seng-jun, Lee Dong-ryeong, as well as Lee Sang-jae and Rhee Syngman, converted to Protestantism during this imprisonment, which was known as the \"Revolutionary Party Incident.\" This marked a unique aspect of the Protestant church and Christianity in Korea. Up until that time, the majority of Christians consisted of middle and lower-class individuals. However, with the conversion of these activists, Christianity rapidly spread among the upper class and intellectuals in Korea. Lee founded the \"Thatched House Church\" in his hometown and later actively participated in Hwangseong YMCA and youth education.\n\nContribution: Lee, Sang-jae is an activist of enlightenment movement and independence movement, educator, particularly for youth education. In the history of independence movement of Korea, Lee has been respected by both conservative and progressive parties. The reason of inserting him in 1920s is to highlight his contributions on the provisional government in Shanghai and youth education in Korea. \n\n [This part will be moved to 1900-1910 decade later.] Establishing the foundation of YMCA. After his release from prison in 1904, Lee Sang-jae devoted himself to the YMCA movement. While the independence movement of the Independence Association was a political movement aimed at preventing Russia's encroachment on Korea's sovereignty, the YMCA movement sought to resist Japan's invasion and achieve Korea's independence through religious and cultural means. Considering that many Independence Association figures dedicated themselves to the YMCA movement after their release from prison during this period, it becomes clear that this was essentially the same independence movement in a different form.\n\nAt that time, Gale was the president of Hwangseong YMCA, and Gillett was the treasurer. The board consisted of four Americans, three British, two Canadians, one Japanese, and two Koreans. In this sense, Hwangseong YMCA was an international organization composed of citizens from five countries, enjoying a kind of extraterritorial status. In 1905, they began to appoint Korean practitioners. Lee Sang-jae became the Chairman of the Education Department of the YMCA in 1905 and later became the Head of the Religious Department in 1908. The primary purpose of the YMCA's activities shifted to promoting Korean nationalist thought. Together with other Independence Association colleagues such as Yoon Chi-ho and Kim Gyu-sik, Lee Sang-jae implemented various modern sports and subjects, including Korean, English, music, and conducted Bible studies. He also organized evening classes for young laborers. While the Chinese YMCA focused on sports education and the Japanese YMCA emphasized church education, the Korean YMCA implemented a school-based approach. During the process of Japan formalizing its colonial rule over Korea, Lee Sang-jae traveled to various places, shouting slogans such as \"Wake up, fellow countrymen, and awaken your spirit\" through YMCA educational programs and various seminars. This eventually evolved into the \"One Million Souls Movement\" in 1909.\n\n[This part will be moved to 1910-1920 decade later.] In 1913, Lee Sang-jae was elected as the general secretary of the Chosun Central Christian Youth Association, succeeding Gillette. Prior to this, there had been attempts by the Chosun Governor-General's Office to Japanize the Chosun YMCA. Therefore, Lee Sang-jae refused financial support from Japan and established a financial foundation and structure for independent survival. He also revitalized night schools for students who studied during the day and strengthened vocational and industrial education. This policy was aimed at providing educational benefits to those who were previously excluded, and it created an environment within the YMCA where both the yangban (nobility) and common people could study freely. In April 1914, at the Triennial Convention, the \"Constitution of the Union of Chosun Christian Youth Associations\" was publicly announced, thereby eliminating the merger with the Japanese YMCA.\n\n\nLee Sang-jae was chosen as one of the 33 national representatives during the March 1st Movement but declined the offer. The reason was that he had a lot to do behind the scenes after the movement. One reason was the anticipated conflicts with missionary workers critical of political involvement and potential suppression of the YMCA if he were to become a representative (Go, 2004). Additionally, he invited American congressmen to Korea via Shanghai to seek international support with Yun, Chi-ho and was preparing to send Korean youth representatives to the Paris Peace Conference (Kim, 2010).\n\nIn May 1922, Lee Sang-jae obtained independence for the Chosun YMCA from the Japanese YMCA, and in 1924, the Chosun YMCA was formally admitted to the World Alliance of YMCA as an independent organization. In April 1922, at the First International Christian Students' Union Conference held in Beijing, Lee Sang-jae, along with other female leaders such as Kim Pil-ye and Kim Hwal-ran, attended as representatives of the Chosun Christian Youth Association. Upon their return, he actively contributed to the formal establishment of the YWCA.\n\nThe 1920s witnessed effective cooperation between Lee Sang-jae and Lee Seung-man. Lee Sang-jae actively supported a visit by a group of Korean students from Hawaii and Lee Seung-man used this visit to inspect the situation of the independence movement in Korea. Lee Sang-jae played a central role in domestic Christian circles sympathetic to Lee Seung-man, while Lee Seung-man raised funds and support to enable Korean representatives to attend the Pan-Pacific Educational Conference in Hawaii in August 1921 and the Pan-Pacific Problem Research Conference in June 1925.\n\nNext, Lee Sang-jae actively participated in the movement to establish private universities. He was elected as the president of the \"Chosun Educational Association\" at its general assembly in June 1920, and in November, the \"Chosun Private University Preparatory Committee\" was formed. Since Japan fundamentally opposed the establishment of university facilities in Korea, private universities were not established as a result.\n\nDuring this period, both domestic and international nationalist activists agreed that they needed to achieve independence on their own and establish a focal point for the independence movement within Korea, particularly in the wake of failures at the Paris Peace Conference. Lee Seung-man was attempting to restrain the influence of the Ahn Chang-ho faction within the Provisional Government and Lee Sang-jae took the lead in establishing a domestic base for Lee Seung-man's independence movement. In 1925, the Heungup Gullakbu (흥업구락부) was organized as a counter-organization to the Heungsadan (흥사단). They worked diligently to gain control over Christian cultural organizations in Korea for fundraising and membership recruitment. In the 1920s, the independence movement was also divided into nationalist and socialist factions. Lee Sang-jae was appointed as the president of the Chosun Ilbo and, in an effort to promote cooperation between nationalist and socialist factions, he persuaded both sides to form a \"National Cooperative Front.\" Subsequently, he assumed the position of the inaugural chairman of the Shin-gan Society, but in 1927, he passed away in a small attic in Seoul without a home of his own. He was a pillar of the Christian nationalist movement.\n\nHyun, Soon, 현순, 玄楯\n\nBirth/Death: 1880/02/28 (Seoul) ~ 1968/07/11 (Los Angeles, U.S.A.)\n\nEducation: Hyun, Soon initially studied Chinese literature when he was young but later attended a government-run English school to further his education. In 1899, he went to Japan to study at Suncheon Middle School (順天中學, Jun Den Kiu Ko Sa). Due to a lack of funds, he had to give up his dream of attending Imperial University and returned to Korea. However, he converted to Christianity in Japan. Before coming to Japan, he had heard about Christianity through his exposure to the Independence Association and speeches by Yun Chi-ho in Seoul, so he was somewhat familiar with it. Through the evangelism efforts of her friend, Shim Ui-sung, he came to understand the following about Christianity: \"Confucianism teaches ethics, morals, and politics; Buddhism teaches past lives, the present life, and the afterlife; Christianity teaches eternal life\" (Han, 1999, p. 14). Upon his return to Korea, he worked as an interpreter for the East-West Development Co. It was during this time that he met George H. Jones, a Methodist missionary who actively recruited Korean immigrants for Hawaii. This encounter led Hyun, Soon and his family to immigrate to Hawaii in 1903. Upon witnessing the challenging realities of immigrant society, he, along with his colleagues, established the first Korean church in Hawaii, the Honolulu Korean Methodist Church. In 1905, he completed her pastoral training in the local circuit minister's education program on the island of Kauai. Around this time,he reunited with missionary Jones, who was on vacation in the United States, and at his invitation, he worked as an assistant pastor alongside Pastor Choi, Byung-heon at Jungdong Jaeil Church. In 1910, upon his return to Korea, he enrolled in the Methodist affiliated Hyupsung Theological Seminary and graduated in the following year, 1911, officially becoming a Methodist pastor.\n\nContribution\n\n[This part will be moved to 1901-1910 decade later.] Frontier of the Korean Immigrant Church. Upon arriving in Hawaii in 1903, he worked as an interpreter and, at the same time, organized a self-fulfilling association with around 50 Korean laborers. They gathered weekly for worship. First-generation Korean activists like Ahn Jung-su, Im Chi-jeong, Lee Gyo-dam, Hong Seung-ha, Yoon Byung-goo, Park Yoon-seop, and others, under the leadership of Pastor Pearson of the Methodist Church, established the Korean Methodist Church in Honolulu in 1903. In 1905, Hyun, Soon was appointed as a missionary to the farms on the island of Kauai at the request of Pastor Wadman. In this area, he preached the gospel to around 2,000 Korean immigrants, served as an interpreter, and helped mediate conflicts. The aforementioned first-generation leaders remained active in the Korean community's movements in Hawaii until the 1940s, and when Hyun Soon returned to Hawaii, they provided support and strength.\n\n[This part will be moved to 1911--1920 decade later.] Introducing the March 1st movement to other countries. In February 1919, as a result of the February 8th Declaration of Independence, which was led by Korean students studying in Tokyo, Hyun Soon, along with Christian leaders like Lee Seung-hoon, Ryu Jo-dae, Ham Tae-yong, and Shin Hong-sik, planned the March 1st Movement. At this time, he was appointed as a diplomatic envoy and headed to Shanghai with the aim of delivering a letter to President Woodrow Wilson, the advocate of national self-determination at the Paris Peace Conference. In the letter, he advocated for Korea's independence for global reform and the maintenance of peace in the East.\n\nFollowing the March 1st Movement, Korean independence activists gathered in Shanghai and established a temporary office on Bochang Road, which had been leased to France by China. Hyun, Soon was appointed as the secretary-general of this office. He played a crucial role in disseminating the plans and progress of the domestic March 1st Movement to compatriots both domestically and abroad, including in the United States and Canada, to foster unity within the independence movement and lay the foundation for the organization of the Shanghai Provisional Government. After the establishment of the Shanghai Provisional Government on April 10, 1919, he was successively appointed as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission. Additionally, he played a significant role in integrating various provisional governments that had sprung up in different locations, bringing Kim Seong-gyeom and Lee Dong-hwi into the fold. In 1920, he was appointed as the interim chairman of the North American Regional Committee and worked passionately, touring the United States for fundraising campaigns. However, a conflict with the Korean community arose over the establishment of the Korean Embassy in the United States, leading him to return to Shanghai.He was succeeded by Seo Jae-pil as the interim chairman.\n\nIn 1922, he returned as a pastor to the Korean Methodist Church in Honolulu. Drawing on his previous experience with immigration, he dedicated herself to serving Korean labor immigrants and Korean immigrants to Hawaii. He personally visited Korean households, learning about their situations and difficulties. He also participated in education for Koreans, actively contributing to the compilation of English language textbooks for the Korean department of the Methodist Church in the United States, starting in 1923. Additionally, he constructed dormitories for Korean leaders and Methodist Korean students. He also organized evening classes for teaching Chinese characters to Korean students to help them maintain their cultural identity.\n\nStarting in 1923, he also became involved in the independence movement of Korean immigrants in the United States. Hee had long envisioned Hawaii as a supply base for the independence movement and had plans to gather the hearts of Koreans living there, using the media to promote economic, educational, and propaganda activities to complete the \"Great Cause\" (대업). However, it seems he did not join major Korean organizations like the National Association (국민회) or the Association of Comrades (동지회) at that time. His standing within the Korean independence movement community decreased significantly due to the opening of the consulate in 1921 and the submission of the independence petition. Furthermore, he faced rejection from the Korean community and difficulty in developing independence movement plans within organizations influenced by Rhee, Syng-man’s authority. In this context, Hyun Soon began to participate in the \"Great Korean Independence Corps\" (대조선독립단) from 1923 onwards.\n\nThe Independence Corps, one of the two major forces leading the Korean community and in continuous competition with Rhee, Syng-man's faction since its formation in March 1919, provided Hyun, Soon with a political space where he could advance his own ideas for Hawaii's independence movement. Furthermore, it is evident from his strong criticism of Rhee, Syng-man’s delegate administration petition in the name of the \"33 Representatives of the Great Korean Independence Corps\" that he criticized Rhee, Syng-man's independence movement line within the Independence Corps. However, he continued her activities in the \"Supporting Committee for the Provisional Government\" (임시정부 후원회) from 1925, shifting his support towards the Provisional Government. At that time, Rhee, Syng-man was facing impeachment, and Hyun, Soon continued to raise independence movement funds, supporting Kim Gu. However, his active involvement in politics and fundraising created conflicts with the Methodist Church in the 1930s. Whether he had socialist tendencies within Christianity is a topic of debate among historians, but there is no clear evidence. However, he was enthusiastic about the establishment of a unified government through Christian reform. His contributions to the revival of the Korean Christian community and support for the independence movement are being reevaluated by more recent historians of Christian history.\n\n\n이덕주, “최병헌의 생애”, 탁사 최병헌의 목사의 생애와 신학, 정동삼문출판사, 2008, ㅔ. 42-45. \n\n김도훈.

Korean missionaries also initiated a joint movement, but the established Korean churches and their members, who were loyal to their denominations, did not actively respond to this movement. One reason for this was the significant loss of lives and property suffered by the Korean church during the March 1st Movement. Another reason was the failure of the joint church movement in 1905. However, this movement evolved into the \"Korean Church Federal Council\" (조선예수교장감연합협의회) in 1918. In 1924, it decided to merge with the Korean Missionary Association, forming the \"Korean National Christian Council\" (조선예수교연합공의회). The rules adopted at the founding meeting of the Council, with Rev. Chae Jae-myeong as the inaugural chairman, stated the organization's objectives as \"cooperatively promoting the spread of the gospel, the advancement of social ethics, and the dissemination of Christian culture.\"\n\n\nThis Korean National Christian Council can be considered the precursor to the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK). Initially, it had the participation of three Korean churches (Korean Presbyterian Church, Korean Methodist Church, and Korean Southern Presbyterian Church) and six foreign missionary boards, as well as two Christian organizations (British and Foreign Bible Society and Korean Christian Youth Association). The number of Korean representatives (40) surpassed that of missionaries (20), leading to the likelihood of Koreans gaining leadership within the organization. In response to this changing situation, missionaries continued the existence of the Korean Missionary Association, which they had planned to dissolve, to maintain their own separate forum.\n\n\nThe Korean National Christian Council organized mission fields and took over the missionary activities of the Korean Missionary Association in Japan and China. It also managed evangelists' training, rural work, temperance movements, and oversaw media broadcasting for evangelism. In 1921, it played a role in introducing global church trends to the domestic audience in connection with the establishment of the International Missionary Council (IMC) in 1921. In 1925, it actively arranged Dr. John R. Mott's visit to Korea as the president of the IMC. In 1928, it sent representatives to the International Missionary Council in Jerusalem, including Shin Hyung-woo, Yang Ju-sam, Jung In-gwa, and Kim Hwal-ran. This event became a decisive moment for shaping the social consciousness of Korean Christians and led the Korean church to strive for the \"socialization and realization of faith,\" working to reform Korean society and rural communities.\n\n\n임희국.

The YMCA's mission was to promote the intellectual, moral, and physical development of young people and played a role in gathering the scattered thoughts of students under Japanese rule. It also played a significant role in the establishment of the Korean Student Congress.\n\n\nThe Korean Student Congress aimed to avoid the fragmentation that had been seen in previous student activities, such as alumni associations or social clubs, and instead emerged as a consolidated body representing the student community, engaging in multifaceted activities. However, the Japanese authorities did not permit this movement. In 1922, amid the rise of anti-Christian sentiment, the 11th World Student Christian Federation Conference was held in Beijing. Students resolved to combine religion and science in their minds to innovate themselves, reform society, and ultimately eliminate social evils such as poverty and establish true peace based on justice and human equality. The \"Buy-Korean\" campaign was also discussed within the YMCA, and socialist ideas gained prominence. In line with the concept of global reform in the context of civilization and strength not being determined by material standards but by the principles of humanity and justice, the idea of reforming the world was advocated.\n\n\nOn the other hand, discussions within the YMCA student body began to focus on the alliance between socialism and Christianity, as an extension of the theory of global reform. In August 1924, during the 10th Student Congress held in Gaecheon, Chaehadong, the resolution stated that the Student YMCA would carry out the temperance movement, campaign against prostitution, promote thriftiness, and encourage agriculture. This resolution was in line with the concurrent movements for industrial development and temperance. However, in October 1925, as socialist activists intensified their anti-Christian movements, some voices within the Student YMCA shifted their focus toward emphasizing the identity of Christianity, moving away from advocating Christian-socialist alliances.\n\nRural enlightenment movement:  The rural activities of the Student YMCA expanded their scope from initially focusing on basic education to activities such as cooperative association organization, agricultural improvement, and promoting supplementary livelihoods after 1929. These activities were divided into two main categories: during vacation and during the semester.\n\nDuring the vacation period, activities included sending lecture teams to address illiteracy, organizing training sessions, operating children's Bible schools, and rural night schools. These activities aimed to combat illiteracy, lead cooperative associations, promote hygiene awareness, and raise awareness for improved living conditions.\n\nFor instance, the Yeonhee College Student YMCA sent a missionary team to places like Gangneung, Geumcheon, Yonggang, and Ui-ju for a week starting on December 27, 1928. They focused on three major activities: faith issues, the Buy-Korean movement, and rural development, illustrating the multifaceted nature of their activities.\n\nAdditionally, during vacations, regular missionary teams were sent to various regions for rural development activities. As the Chosun Ilbo's literacy campaign (1929-1934) and Dong-a Ilbo's broadcasting campaign (1931-1934) unfolded, using the vacation period for rural enlightenment activities became a common sight in the daily life of students.\n\n\nTable.

The rural activities of the Student YMCA expanded their focus from basic education in the early days to include cooperative association organization, agricultural improvement, and support for supplementary livelihoods after 1929. These activities were broadly categorized into two phases: during vacation and during the semester.\n\nDuring the vacation period, activities included sending lecture teams, organizing training sessions, running children's Bible schools, and rural night schools. These activities aimed to combat illiteracy, provide guidance for cooperative associations, promote hygiene awareness, and raise awareness for improved living conditions. An example of this is the Yeonhee College Student YMCA, which, from December 27, 1928, for one week, dispatched missionary teams to various locations such as Gangneung, Geumcheon, Yonggang, and Ui-ju. They focused on three major activities: addressing faith issues, promoting the Buy-Korean movement, and engaging in rural development activities.\n\nFurthermore, in response to the arrival of the vacation period, they began regularly sending missionary teams to various regions. This culminated in the establishment of the Student YM-YWCA Joint Meeting, which included representatives from 10 male and 10 female schools, and the organization of a Presidents' Leadership Meeting, marking the beginning of their collaborative efforts.\n\nThe joint activities of the Student YM-YWCA took a new turn in August 1927, when they held the First Korean Men's and Women's Student Christian Youth Association Joint Leadership Conference at the residence of Min Young-chan in Seongbuk-dong, Dongso-mun outside of Seoul. This event brought together 76 male and 45 female students from 28 schools, with a total of 121 participants. They engaged in various activities, including lectures and free discussions on topics such as religion and national identity, Christianity and daily life, the determination of modern youth, Christian non-resistance, and rural development, all under the slogan \"Let's Move Forward.\" However, in September 1931, when the Manchurian Incident occurred, the collaborative activities of the student federation faced an unexpected setback. Due to restrictions imposed by the Japanese colonial government on the activities of public organizations, not only social activities but also the proper organization of joint leadership meetings became increasingly challenging.\n\nNevertheless, these various alliances played a significant role in the development of the Gwangju Student Movement in 1929. \n\n\n장규식.

After 1910, many Koreans who had immigrated to China or sought refuge there due to various political, economic, and religious pressures, including the incident involving 105 officials of the Chosun Governor-General's Office, began to increase. According to statistics published in 1921, there were approximately 49,771 Korean immigrants in Manchuria. Since Japan did not permit study abroad in the United States, Korean youth preparing for overseas education also made preparations in China. During this period, China was a battleground for various world powers, and Shanghai, in particular, was the largest international city in Asia. Koreans formed Christian communities with the help of missionaries from various countries around the world. Western political and economic forces concentrated in Shanghai conveyed Woodrow Wilson's principle of self-determination to the members of the New Korea Young Men Association, who in turn propagated it within Korea. Therefore, the New Korea Young Men Association was organized to send representatives to international conferences to appeal for Korea's independence in accordance with the changing global situation.\n\nIndependence Petition. The primary activities of the New Korea Young Men Association (신한청년단) included drafting an independence petition and attempting to deliver it to President Wilson of the United States, as well as sending Kim Kyu-sik as a representative to the Paris Peace Conference. Many domestic papers have overlooked the Christian nature of this organization, but their Christian spirit is evident in the independence petition. Written primarily by Yun Chi-ho, the introduction argued that the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations should discuss the customs of Korea and Japan in accordance with Wilson's principle of self-determination. Japan was criticized for revering military personnel over scholars, acknowledging the Emperor's divine authority, and demanding unquestioning obedience, making it unfit for membership in the League of Nations. It was also suggested that Japan would not hesitate to go to war not only in Asia but also against the United States, posing a threat to world peace. In contrast, Korea, the original Great Empire that succeeded Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, was described as having lost its country to Japan despite its Hongik Ingan (Benefit All Humanity) spirit passing through the ages. Japan's persecution of Korea was first discussed in terms of mental oppression. Japan considered Christianity the biggest obstacle to its rule over Chosun, and thus, it imposed Confucianism, Buddhism, and other religions. Furthermore, it suppressed education, economic activities, political freedom, and freedom of the press while hindering Korea's development. Secondly, Japan's rule through the Hyeonbyeong Police took away property rights and parliamentary debate rights. Thirdly, Japan strictly controlled the economic activities of Koreans, confiscated farmland, and took away resources, making it impossible for Koreans to make a living.\n\nChristian nationalism. The historical significance of the New Korea Young Men Association can be seen in the shift in the goals of the independence movement. Previously, the goal was to establish Emperor Gojong and reclaim Joseon, but now the aim was to establish a democratic nation centered around the United States. Secondly, the Christian-dominated independence movement shifted from being religion-centered to being Christian-centered. Finally, Christianity became the new spiritual model for the nation. Their most important achievement was providing financial and human resources to Korea before the March 1st Movement. As a result, Shanghai is recognized as the birthplace of the March 1st Movement and the center of the independence movement, with the New Korea Young Men Association being credited for its promotion. These individuals became key figures in the provisional government, so the relationship between Christianity and the Shanghai Provisional Government had been planned even before its establishment.\n\n\n이규수.

Between 1907 and 1910, approximately 10,000 people immigrated to Gando each year, and the Korean immigrant population in the Yanbian region, which was 30,000 in 1897, reached 60,000 in 1911.\n\n\nThe Korean Migration in 1910-1930 (Adapted from the High School History Textbook published by Kumsung Publishing, Korea. \n\n\nManchuria and Siberia, also known as the starting point of the March 1st Movement, later became hubs for the independence movement. Apart from the fact that many prominent ethnic leaders in the region of Manchuria and Siberia were Christians, it is significant that, both before and after the March 1st Movement, Christian churches, schools, and church local organizations were often used as points of contact and activity bases for the independence movement.\n\nThe Manchuria region can be divided into three main areas: the southern Manchuria region, centered around Bongcheon and Honggyeong; the eastern Manchuria (Gando) region, centered around Yeongil and Huncheon; and the northern Manchuria region, centered around Gilim, Singyeong, and Harbin. In southern Manchuria, the Presbyterian Church of Pyeongbuk Province and the Presbyterian Church in North America mission departments were primarily involved. In eastern Manchuria, the Presbyterian Church of Hamgyeong Province and the Presbyterian Church in Canada mission departments played a significant role. In northern Manchuria, the Methodist Episcopal Church mission department and the Korean Evangelical Holiness Church were mainly responsible.\n\n\nThe first Presbyterian church in South Manchuria was the Lee Yang-ja Church established in Juean County in 1898. In 1900, the church was destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion, causing great suffering to its members. The following year, missionaries N.C. Whittemore and Ahn, Seung-won were sent to console the congregation and rebuild the church, marking a significant milestone in Korean church missionary work in the South Manchuria region. Around the same time, the Korean Mission of the Northern Presbyterian Church received a request from the Scottish Presbyterian Church Mission for Korean missionaries to be responsible for Korean missionary work in Manchuria. As a result, the Northern Presbyterian Church Mission began sending Korean evangelists in 1901. With the growth of churches in the Manchuria region, the South Manchuria (Namman) Synod was organized on April 21, 1921. The South Manchuria Presbytery also expanded its missionary activities in the region, sending Korean missionaries in 1922 and 1923, who worked throughout Manchuria. However, during this time, they faced challenges due to the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, attacks by bandits, increased surveillance, and oppression by Japan, particularly after the March 1st Movement.\n\nDespite these difficulties, missionary work in the Manchuria region, led by the South Manchuria synod, achieved significant milestones, including the establishment of the Bongcheonho synod in 1936-5 and the Yonggu synod in 1937. Here are the church statistics for the South Manchuria Presbytery from 1921 to 1930.\n\n| Year | Church | NA | NA | Christians | NA | Pastor | Budget(KW) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | Organi-zation | Unorga-nized | Prayer Center | Baptized | Total | NA | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1924 | 19 | 25 | 90 | 2,192 | 4,790 | 5 | 20,493.34 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1925 | 15 | 25 | 43 | 2,387 | 5,136 | 7 | 22,266.57 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1926 | 20 | 34 | 90 | 3,012 | 5,992 | 8 | 20,730.45 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | 16 | 20 | 54 | 2,113 | 3,250 | 12 | 38,153.95 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1928 | 23 | 20 | 52 | 2,766 | 5,415 | 12 | 17,375.00 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1929 | 21 | 38 | 59 | 2,993 | 5,078 | 12 | 14,850.48 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 18 | 38 | 56 | 2,116 | 3,935 | 10 | 20,204.56 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nAdapted by “The History of Christianity in Korea 2,” (2021). p. 119. The Institute of the History of Christianity in Korea. \n\n\nMission to Siberia. It began in 1909 when Pastor Choi Gwan-heum was sent by the Independent Korean Presbyterian Church. After the March 1st Movement, the number of immigrants to the Siberian region increased, and by 1921, there were 32 churches and 1,763 church members. In 1922, there was explosive growth, thanks to the revival led by Pastor Kim Ik-du, leading to the organization of the Siberian Presbytery in 1922. However, due to the Communist Revolution, Pastor Kwon Seung-kyung was arrested and sentenced to death in 1924, and in 1925, the Presbytery was dissolved. Afterward, the South Manchuria Presbytery and the Hamgyeong Presbytery jointly managed this region. In 1929, with a report of 8 churches and over 900 believers, the Siberian mission effectively came to an end.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church's mission in Eastern Manchuria, often referred to as Gando or North Gando, was initiated by the Canadian Presbyterian Mission Board. In 1906, a Chinese church member named Dan Geum, who was in Yongjeong (Longjing, 龍井), came to Wonsan and purchased Christian books to support Korean evangelism in Gando. When this became known, Korean churches started showing interest in missionary work in the Kando region. In 1908, the South Methodist Church dispatched Missionary Lee, Hwa Chun, and in 1907, the Waryongdong Church was established. In 1909, the Myeongdong Church was founded through the efforts of Koreans who had sought refuge in Gando due to their involvement in nationalist activities, such as Kim, Yak-yeon, Kim, Jeong-gyu, Kim, Ha-gyu, Moon, Jeong-ho, Moon, Chi-jeong, and Choi, Bong-gi. In 1908, the Myeongdong (明東) School was established, and the invitation of Christian from Pyeongan Province, Jung, Jae-myeon, as a teacher, served as a catalyst for mass conversion and the establishment of churches. Following explosive growth, by 1911, 24 churches were established.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the South Methodist Mission and the Canadian Presbyterian Mission, which had started missionary work in Kando, reached an agreement in 1909 to allow South Methodist Church to relinquish the Gando region in exchange for the Canadian Presbyterian Mission's territory within Gangwon Province. Subsequently, with significant development, Gando became the cradle of the nationalist movement, especially after the arrival of Yi, Dong-hwi in 1914, who was an exile from Kando, and as nationalist activists continued to join the movement.\n\nOrganizations such as the Yanbian Churchmen's Association (1907) and the National Association brought together community members where Christian leaders gathered to engage in anti-Japanese nationalist and enlightenment activities. Following the March 1st Movement and severe suppression by the Japanese, the churches in the Gando region suffered greatly. Despite this persecution, they established the Gando Synod and, on December 1, 1921, gained independence from the Hamgyeong Synod. In 1925, they changed their name to the Eastern Manchuria Synod.

Black, and others from the Canadian Presbyterian Mission resided and conducted their activities. Missionary institutions operated by the mission, such as Eunjin Middle School in Yongjeong, Myeongshin Women's School, and the Jechang Hospital, left a positive impression on the Korean community in the Gando region. In particular, the founder of the Jechang Hospital, S. H. Martin, devotedly treated Koreans injured in the March 1st Movement and provided support for Korea's independence movement, contributing to a favorable perception of Koreans by offering assistance.\n\nThe Northern Manchuria Mission of the Methodist Church. Before 1930, the Methodist Church of the United States and the Southern Methodist Church of the United States conducted separate missionary efforts. In 1910, Pastor So Jeong-do settled in Harbin, but he was dedicated to the independence movement, including the establishment of the Sinheung Military School, and was arrested. In 1918, he was again sent as a missionary to Manchuria. Around 1921, churches were established in Changchun and Harbin, and several prayer places or chapels were founded. There were reported to be 158 baptized members and a total of 481 church members. In 1923, with the inclusion of the Gilimseong 吉林省region, which was under the administration of the Southern Methodist Church, it experienced growth. From 1923 onwards, it showed even greater growth. The activities of women cannot be overlooked. In 1924, Korean missionary Yang, Woo-rodeoree (梁雨路德) was sent as a missionary. She departed for Manchuria in January 1925 and worked in Harbin, with female missionaries like Nam, Gyeong-soon and Yi, Bae-se participating actively in missionary work until the late 1930s.\n\n| Year | Church | NA | Christians | NA | Pastors | NA | Budget |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | Church | Prayer C | Baptized | Total | Pastor | Assistant | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1923 |  |  | 463 | 1,353 | 2 | 6 | 2,525 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1924 | 18 | 10 | 411 | 1,159 | 4 | 5 | 4,987 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1925 | 19 | 7 | 456 | 1,365 | 4 | 2 | 8,845 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1926 | 17 | 11 | 489 | 1,440 | 4 | 2 | 12,167 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | 19 | 15 | 538 | 1,465 | 4 | - | 9,962 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1928 | 15 | 20 | 475 | 1,302 | 4 | - | 4,333 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1929 | 8 | 10 | 355 | 1,150 | 3 | - | 2,878 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 11 | 6 | 445 | 1,340 | 5 | - | 2,493 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nAdapted by “The History of Christianity in Korea 2,” (2021). p. 126. The Institute of the History of Christianity in Korea. \n\n\nAs the United Methodist Church intensified its missionary activities in the Northern Manchuria region, there were instances of overlap with other denominational missionary efforts. Due to significant overlapping areas with the North Presbyterian Church, in 1924, the \"Presbyterian and Methodist Joint Committee on Missionary Work\" was established. They divided the region along the railway connecting Bongcheon, Changchun, and Harbin. The northwestern part was assigned to the United Methodist Church, while the southeastern part was entrusted to the North Presbyterian Church. In this context, it becomes evident that the missionary division agreements that were applied within Korea were also applied here.\n\nMissionary work in Shandong, China by Korean churches was the first instance of Koreans going abroad for missionary purposes. In 1912, through discussions with the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea, Park Tae-ro and Kim Chan-sung, pastors from Jaeryeong, were sent to Shandong to investigate potential mission sites with the aim of obtaining a \"missionary permit.\" In 1913, the General Assembly officially dispatched Kim Young-hoon, Park Tae-ro, and Sa Byung-soon as missionaries. The General Assembly also decided that \"missionaries should not establish independent churches but collaborate with the local presbytery in that region\" (Records of the First General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea, 1912).\n\nIn 1916, Korean missionaries were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Chinese church. This demonstrated the willingness to affiliate newly established churches in Shandong with the Chinese church, rather than the Korean church. Missionaries sent from Korea were re-affiliated with the Chinese church, and their authority in Korea was limited to that of advisors. This decision was made in consideration of the strong relationships with local Chinese churches and the convenience of missionary work in China.\n\nAfter only three years of missionary work in Shandong, 28 baptisms had taken place, six prayer meeting groups were established, and three schools for Chinese students were founded (Korean Church History Vol. 2, p. 141). However, due to health reasons, the three missionaries returned, and new missionaries were dispatched. In 1923, Dr. Joo Hyeon-cheok, a native of Suncheon, joined the mission and opened a hospital in Jimo.\n\nThere are two methods of evangelism targeted towards Chinese people. The first method is called \"House Church Evangelism 座堂傳道,\" where a house is purchased in a specific location and named the \"Gospel Hall.\" In this place, evangelistic materials and worship facilities are provided. The second method is known as \"Itinerant Evangelism 遊行傳道,\" where a \"Gospel Team\" is organized, carrying tents and equipment as they travel to spread the message. Itinerant evangelism was quite effective, and according to a report in 1928, these teams visited 107 regions, reaching over 50,000 people. They also sold 4,700 copies of the Gospel, resulting in 99 new converts in a year (Korean Christian History, p. 142).\n\n\nThanks to these efforts, the Shandong mission experienced explosive growth within just ten years. Behind this growth, there was active support from Christians in Pyongyang. The growth of churches, congregations, and schools in the Shandong region is as follows:\n\n| Year | Church | NA | Christians | NA | NA | School | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | Church | Place of worship | Baptized for the year | Baptized | Total Registered | School | Student |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | 1 |  | 3 | 12 | 40 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1916 | 1 |  |  | 12 | 40 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1917 | 1 | 6 | 9 | 28 | 50 | 3 | 32 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1918 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 32 | 85 | 3 | 31 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1919 | 2 | 6 | 19 | 49 | 89 | 3 | 35 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1920 | 10 | 8 | 41 | 416 | 520 | 11 | 176 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1921 | 10 | 21 | 31 | 431 | 617 | 13 | 269 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1922 | 9 | 25 | 34 | 494 | 746 | 11 | 289 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1923 | 10 | 25 | 58 | 591 | 815 | 19 | 435 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1924 | 12 | 30 | 26 | 585 | 818 | 13 | 358 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1925 | 12 | 27 | 43 | 652 | 823 | 12 | 315 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1926 | 11 | 26 | 55 | 720 | 884 | 15 | 435 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | 13 | 20 | 42 | 798 | 971 | 12 | 281 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1928 | 13 | 20 | 52 | 898 | 1006 | 12 | 242 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1929 | 15 | 30 | 48 | 902 | 1123 | 9 | 181 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 15 | 34 | 60 | 970 | 1207 | 7 | 160 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1931 | 15 | 36 | 34 | 1004 | 1308 | 6 | 139 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1932 | 16 | 35 | 70 | 1021 | 1292 | 7 | 150 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1933 | 17 | 30 | 73 | 1041 | 1324 | 7 | 169 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1934 | 19 | 30 | 73 | 1090 | 1416 | 9 | 190 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1935 | 21 | 30 | 38 | 1073 | 1400 | 6 | 153 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1936 | 21 | 32 | 31 | 1088 | 1398 | 4 | 107 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1938 |  | 36* | 11 |  | 1352 | 1 | 25 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1939 | 19 | 13 | 37 | 1160 | 1479 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1940 |  | 33* | 61 |  | 1569 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1941 |  | 34* | 116 |  | 1662 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1942 |  | 35* | 101 |  | 1716 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n*Church + Place of worship\n\nIn the table, churches rapidly increased in the early 1920s, and schools also saw growth during the 1920s. However, the growth of both churches and schools was not observed after 1938.During the period of political and social turmoil, including the Mukden Incident in Manchuria in 1931, the Shanghai Incident in 1932, and the large-scale anti-Japanese resistance by Chinese people leading up to the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Korean missionaries and churches found themselves in a peculiar position between the Chinese and the invading Japanese. The resentment held by Chinese people towards Korean missionaries and Korean churches was one significant factor.\n\nIn the 1930s, as the Communist Party gained dominance in its struggle against the Nationalist government, a prevailing atmosphere of anti-religion and anti-Christian sentiment in China led to attacks on Korean churches. From the Chinese perspective, the activities of Korean missionaries could be interpreted as an extension of Japan's aggression in China. As a result, starting from the 1930s, the Shandong mission was gradually brought to a halt. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nEnlightening Movement of Rural Areas\n\n\nJapan initiated the land survey project from the early stages of colonization (1910) and in the 1920s implemented the \"Campaign to increase rice production\" to transform the Korean Peninsula into a strategic source of food and resources for Japan. The colonization of Korea served as a means for Japan to secure essential sustenance and materials as it sought to dominate Asia.\n\nTo achieve this, Japan divided the Korean rural population into tenant farmers and landlords through the land survey project, and it rigorously monitored to prevent the growth of the intermediate class in rural society. The rice harvest, which was 12.7 million suk (䄷, 1 suk  = 144 kg) in 1920, increased to 17.3 million suk by 1928, a growth of 4.6 million suk. However, during the same period, the quantity of rice exported to Japan rose significantly from 1.85 million suk in 1920 to 7.42 million suk in 1928. Consequently, Koreans had their rice production siphoned off to Japan and substituted with millet imported from Manchuria. This, combined with the global economic downturn, led to severe hardship in rural areas.\n\n\nYMCA. The YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) initiated rural social movements. From July 1 to the end of December 1920, they conducted a nationwide tour, sending gospel teams to promote a spirit of challenge among rural youth, encouraging social cohesion, and aiming to improve the economic livelihood of rural communities. They also conducted surveys of rural conditions. The YMCA carried out a restructuring, establishing rural and urban departments within the YMCA Federation in November 1925, appointing five members to each committee. As a result, six city YMCA branches, excluding Pyongyang and Wonsan, collectively initiated rural movements. Among student YMCA branches, institutions like Sungsil School, Youngmyung School (Gongju), Yeongseng School (Hamhung), and Gwangsung High School (Kaeseong) began participating in rural movements.\n\n\nThe YMCA also embarked on a second rural survey. In 1926, Professor Brunner from Columbia University, dispatched by the YMCA International Committee, conducted a one-year survey with Korean scholar Ha Gyeong-deok, culminating in the publication of \"Rural Korea.\" The primary motivations behind this research were to showcase the achievements of the Korean rural movement to the world and to highlight the urgency and importance of rural movements in non-missionary regions. In his research report, Brunner noted, \"The miraculous growth actually began to slow down when the initial rural work became evident.\" He criticized the church for not recognizing the changes in the era, the ideological transformation process of individuals, failure to provide appropriate scientific education, restricting the voice of young individuals, undermining the morale within the church hierarchy, and not understanding the issues and concerns that were spreading among intellectuals. As a result of these criticisms, in 1928, Canadian missionary Barnes, an expert in livestock, horticulture, and poultry, was dispatched along with Clark, a former agricultural administrator. Together with Korean assistants, they engaged in rural enlightenment movements, cooperative association movements, and the training of rural leaders. However, the rural movement faced challenges during the 1930s and 40s due to factors such as the economic depression, constant threats to merge the Korean YMCA into Japan, the imprisonment of prominent leaders like Yun, Chi-ho, and the death of Lee, Sang-jae.\n\n\nYWCA. YWCA's involvement in rural outreach began in 1928 when representatives from the Korean YMCA, including women, participated in the International Missionary Council. This conference marked a turning point in the social consciousness of the Korean church, shifting the focus of Christian activism from urban-centered movements to rural-centered ones. Given that the majority of the Korean population lived in rural areas, and most churchgoers were farmers, this shift in focus was essential.\n\n\nIn the same year, YWCA established its Rural Department, which initiated enlightenment campaigns such as the training of rural women leaders and the promotion of rural women's education. The primary goal of the Rural Women Leaders Training Institute was to elevate the status of rural housewives, instill a sense of their spiritual worth, and promote rational living for the betterment of their communities. The aim was for these women to return to their rural communities, work together with other women, and bring about positive changes in rural life. \n\n\nAnother program was the Rural Women's Education Center, which mainly conducted education through local newspapers. The content of education focused on emotional development, encouragement of industrial cooperatives, and the implementation of home-based supplementary income activities to improve rural economies. The purpose of the rural enlightenment movement was to make rural women realize the urgency of their awakening, as it would lead to the improvement of the rural economy and the preservation of the nation.\n\n\nThis rural movement was particularly exemplified by Choi Yong-sin. The foundation of Choi Yong-sin's rural work was the belief that once illiteracy was eradicated, rural women could raise their level of education through intensive instruction and lectures. This, in turn, would lead to the elevation of the status of rural women, which was essential for the development of the country. Under Choi's guidance, specialized missionary teachers in agriculture, animal husbandry, and poultry farming, such as the Canadian missionary Burns, were dispatched to Korea. They worked alongside Korean assistants to promote rural enlightenment, cooperative movements, and the training of rural leaders.\n\n\nHowever, the rural movement faced challenges during the 1930s and 40s due to factors such as the economic depression, constant threats to merge the Korean YMCA into Japan, the imprisonment of prominent leaders like Yun, Chi-ho, and the death of Lee, Sang-jae.\n\n\nPresbyterian Church. The Presbyterian Church's rural movement began to take shape with a clear social consciousness within the church starting in 1928, following the participation of representatives from the church in the Jerusalem International Missionary Council. In the same year, the church established the Rural Department, initiated the Rural Association, and encouraged children's education in rural areas. In 1929, a conference was held in response to Motte's visit, focusing on topics such as the church's life and work, the need for trained leaders, financial support, spiritual unity, and cooperation in business. Suggestions included more practical preaching of the gospel, Christian ethical commerce, the implementation of the Old Testament, savings, diligence, cooperative associations, and the dispatch of one agricultural specialist missionary to each missionary district. The direction of the Presbyterian Church's rural movement included rural evangelism, rural hygiene, rural education, rural transportation, and rural cooperative movements.\n\n\nMethodist Church.  (This section will be moved to the 1930s decade later.) The Methodist Church had a unique aspect in its rural movement, which was the utilization of unpaid lay preachers. According to statistics from 1937, out of 112 preachers, only 26 were members of the annual conference, another 26 were assistant preachers, and the remaining 60 were unpaid lay preachers. Among these 60, there were 34 farmers, 11 shopkeepers, 6 unemployed individuals, 4 teachers, and 1 each of doctor, agricultural laborer, secretary, and barber. A survey in October 1937 in the Gongju region found that 35 out of 45 worship services were conducted by unpaid lay preachers. Peyton believed that utilizing these individuals could solve the \"economic problem of rural churches.\" In 1931, in villages where 234 churches were located nationwide, two-thirds were supported and developed by such unpaid preachers.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the Methodist Church's rural work was the \"Church Farm Practical Use.\" In 1927, Noble purchased a piece of land to secure church finances. In reality, by 1933, nearly one-third of the 52 Methodist churches had such land, and it was assisting the church finances. Some church lands amounted to 200 jeongbo (1 jeongbo = 3.3 squared meters), while others reached 20,000 jeongbo. On average, each church had about 2 acres of land.\n\n\nThree-quarters of these church lands were leased to tenant farmers, and the rental income contributed to the church budget. The remaining one-quarter was cultivated by church members themselves. The income from these lands was not necessarily substantial; in 1937, the average income was 74 won, which was barely one-fifth of a pastor's annual salary. However, it made a practical contribution to the economic development of rural churches through cash donations, labor contributions, cooperative spirit, and new forms of agricultural improvement and experimentation.\n\n\n  강원돈,\"한국민족민주 운동에 비추어본 한국 기독교(1)\"[신학사상] 1988.봄\n\n  강인규.\"1920년대 반 기독교 운동을 통해서 본 기독교\",[한국기독교사 연구 제9호] .1986.8.\n\n  김병서.\"사회운동의 기독교의 사명\"[기독교사상]1989.5.\n\n 노치준. \"일제하 한국 새신교 운동의 사회학적 연구\", [한국 사회학연구 제 6집]. 1982.6.\n\n\nLiterary Mission Movement\n\nAfter the March 1st Movement, the Japanese colonial government allowed a limited degree of press freedom as a core strategy of \"cultural politics.\" As a result, in the 1920s, newspapers such as Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo, which continue to represent Korea today, were founded. In the Christian community, missionary activities using documents, including newspapers and magazines, became active. The \"Christian Shinbo,\" a joint newspaper founded in 1915 by the Presbyterian and Methodist churches, obtained permission from the colonial government to publish general news articles on politics, diplomacy, society, and more, just like regular newspapers.\n\n\nBefore the March 1st Movement, there were magazines published by missionaries, such as the English magazine \"The Korea Mission Field\" (1905) and denominational magazines like \"Shinhangsegye\" (Theological World) published by the Methodist Hyupsung Theological Seminary (1916) and \"Sinhangjinam\" (Theological South) published by the Presbyterian Pyongyang Theological Seminary (1918). In addition, in the 1920s, magazines like \"Hwalseon\" (1922) from the Holiness Church and \"Sagwan\" (1927) from the Salvation Army were established. Christian organizations also published magazines, including \"Hyundai\" (1920) and \"Jeolmeuni\" (1923) from the Tokyo Chosen YMCA, \"Cheongnyeon\" (1921) from the Seoul YMCA, \"Jooilhakgyojapji\" (Sunday School Magazine) from the Korea Sunday School Union (1925), and \"Jinsaeng\" (1925) from the Christian Endeavor of the Korea United Association. Individual and literary coterie magazines were also actively published.\n\n\nIn the 1910s, there were 21 magazines, in the 1920s, there were 43, in the 1930s, there were 49, and in the 1940s, there were 6, totaling 119 magazines (Han, 1987; Yoon, 2003; The Institute of the History of Christianity in Korea 2, 2019, p. 79). This is evidence that the cultural politics policy of the colonial government influenced the Korean church's interest in missionary work through documents. Leaders of the Korean church, especially figures like Park Seung-bong, Yoo Sung-jun, Yoon Chi-ho, Lee Sang-jae, and Choi Byung-heon of the YMCA, as well as Kim Baek-won, Kim Se-hwan, Kim Chang-jun, Lee Seung-hoon, and Jung No-sik, who played a key role in the March 1st Movement, actively participated in establishing companies specializing in Christian books and the publication of Christian literature.\n\n\nIn 1922, they changed the name from 'Chosun Christian Light Company' to 'Changmunsa' and published magazines like 'Sin Saengmyeong' (New Life) and various books, while actively progressing with the Korean translation of the Bible. In 1925, J.S. Gale and Lee Won-mo jointly translated the 'New Testament' in a way that reflected the contemporary Korean language as much as possible, different from the Bible translated by the Missionary Committee at the time. During this period, the revision and reorganization of the Bible and hymnals also took place actively. 'Gwanju (貫珠, Reference) Seonhanmun Old Testament' (1926) and 'New Testament Commentary' were published for Bible scholars. In 1924, the Korean National Christian Council formed a hymnal committee as its first project and began revising the hymnal published jointly by the Presbyterian and Methodist churches in 1908.\n\n한영재 편, “한국기독교 정기간행물 100년” (기독교문사, 1987), p  25-28\n\n윤춘병, “한국기독교신문, 잡지백년사: 1885-1945” (감리교신학대학교 출판부, 2003). \n\n\nSunday School Movement\n\nThe March 1st Movement sparked significant interest not only among young people but also in child education. Missionary William N. Blair, in particular, focused on the Sunday school movement. In just one year, in 1920, the number of Sunday schools increased from over 10,000 to over 14,000. Additionally, the 1920 World Sunday School Convention held in Japan decided to send world Sunday school leaders to Korea for the next three years to visit and guide Sunday schools nationwide for six months each year, in order to promote the development of Sunday school activities in Korea.\n\nAround the time of the establishment of the Korean Sunday School Union in November 1922, there were three significant events that promoted Sunday school activities in Korea. First, there was the Forward Movement in the Presbyterian Church and the Century Movement in the Methodist Church, both initiated at the denominational level during the September 1919 general assembly, which significantly expanded Sunday school activities in Korea after the March 1st Movement. The 1919 Presbyterian General Assembly decided to carry out a three-year Forward Movement and appointed 36 members, three from each presbytery, to promote the Forward Movement. The goal was to organize in 1919 and achieve remarkable results in the third year, 1921. While not exclusively focused on the Sunday school movement, the key was to rapidly increase church Sunday worship and Sunday school attendance. The explosive growth of Sunday schools after the March 1st Movement was closely related to the Forward Movement and the Century Movement. After the March 1st Movement, the Forward Movement, deeply intertwined with Sunday school activities and revival movements, was conducted nationwide with the Presbyterian Church at its center.\n\nThe Forward Movement was carried out in two periods, from 1919 to 1926 and from 1929 to 1935. The most significant outcome of the Forward Movement was Sunday schools for young people within the church. Over the course of three years from 1920, the Forward Movement provided a crucial foundation for overcoming the crisis in Korea in 1919. During this period, both the number of students and teachers in Korean Presbyterian Sunday schools saw significant growth. After the March 1st Movement, the remarkable growth of Sunday schools in Korea saw a total of 3,899 Sunday schools and 223,732 students in 1921. There was a strong hope among Sunday school activists that through Sunday school education, they could reform the people and expand the church to create a better nation. In this historical context, Sunday schools presented an excellent opportunity to instill Christian values in Korea's youth. The remarkable growth of Sunday schools provided the impetus for attracting young people, who were susceptible to socialist or communist ideologies or moral decay, into the church and offering them new tasks within the church to ignite a new revival movement. Thousands of young people trained in Sunday schools during that era would later grow into outstanding leaders in the Korean church.\n\nAlthough the era of winning new converts had become more challenging, it was believed that \"if Sunday schools prosper, the church will naturally thrive.\" In fact, Yang Joo-sam stated that at the Fourth National Sunday School Convention, 85% of new believers were recruited into the church through Sunday schools. The activation of Sunday schools, in particular, was a response to the contemporary request placed upon the Korean church for effective evangelism and proper education for the upcoming generations.\n\nThe 8th Tokyo World Sunday School Convention and the 1st National Sunday School Convention. The 8th Tokyo World Sunday School Convention held in Japan from October 5th to 14th, 1920, had the \"most direct impact\" on the Sunday school movement in the Korean church. Originally scheduled for 1916, this convention was postponed due to World War I and took place in Tokyo, Japan, in 1920, just one year after the March 1st Movement. Over 300 representatives from various countries who attended the 8th World Sunday School Convention visited Korea to tour and support the Sunday school movement. They traveled to regions with active Sunday schools, including Seoul, Pyongyang, Kaesong, and Daegu, and conducted lectures to promote the Korean Sunday school movement. This atmosphere allowed for the organization of the 1st National Sunday School Convention in 1921, where 960 representatives from all over Korea, including South and North Korea, participated.\n\nThe Establishment and Activities of the Korean Sunday School Union. On November 1, 1922, 27 representatives from 10 organizations gathered at the Episcopal Church meeting room and established the Korean Sunday School Union. The Sunday School Committee, which had existed since 1911, played an important role in the establishment of the Korean Sunday School Union, and the 8th World Sunday School Convention in 1920 and the 1st National Sunday School Convention in 1921 were crucial background events leading to the formation of the Korean Sunday School Union. Among the 27 representatives who attended the founding assembly, there were eight each from the Presbyterian and Northern Methodist Churches, two from the Northern Presbyterian Church Mission, two from the Southern Methodist Church Mission, two from the Northern Methodist Church Mission, one from the Southern Presbyterian Church Mission, one from the Canadian Mission, one from the Australian Presbyterian Mission, one from the Sunday School Union, and one from the Korean Bible Society, totaling 27 members. The president was Oh Cheon-gyeong (Presbyterian), the vice president was Hong Byeong-seon (Methodist), the secretary was Byeon Seong-ok (Methodist), the treasurer was Bang Wi-ryang (Presbyterian). In September 1930, the Korean Sunday School Union also joined the \"World Sunday School Association\" (World Sunday School Association). In 1928, Kim Gwan-sik, Lee Seong-hwi, and Kwak An-ryeon were sent to the World Sunday School Convention held in Los Angeles, USA, strengthening the relationship between the Korean Sunday School Union and the World Sunday School Association. In January 1929, Lacy highly praised the Korean Sunday School Union as follows: \"The Korean Sunday School Union is a growing organization. The number of staff is increasing, and the budget is increasing as well. It has grown from an estimated 9,000 won budgets to over 12,000 won this year. It requests the help and cooperation of many people. The work that the Korean Sunday School Union has prioritized is extensive. In my judgment, the three most important tasks that the Korean Sunday School Union has undertaken before the Liberation War are as follows: First, the publication of documents related to Sunday school education. Second, sending representatives to the World Sunday School Convention to maintain continuous contact with the World Sunday School Association. Third, hosting the National Sunday School Convention in Korea.\"\n\n박용규.

The content of the \"Temperance Movement\" was similar to the \"Moral Reform\" movement that was common at the time and was led by the widespread promotion of temperance, including the Gold-Ju (abstention from alcohol) Movement. It encompassed efforts to abolish gambling, prohibit opium use, and promote moderation in food and clothing. This can be seen as an attempt to overcome the dire socioeconomic conditions by conserving consumption and aligning with the emerging cultural construction, skills development, and spiritual reform movements, all of which were part of the \"Cultural Movement\" that expressed itself through movements such as the \"Cultivation Movement,\" \"Moral Reform Movement,\" and \"Rural Improvement Movement.\"\n\n\nThe Christian temperance ethics, which emphasized abstaining from alcohol and had similarities to Puritanism ethics, were well-suited to the situation where Japan distributed addictive goods like alcohol, tobacco, and opium as part of its economic exploitation through projects like the Land Survey Project and the Increase of Rice Production Project. Japan also introduced state-regulated prostitution known as the \"Gongchang system,\" which encouraged debauchery. Liquor and tobacco taxes were imposed as well. The Christian temperance movement was triggered by these circumstances.\n\n\nThe influence of missionary personnel who held conservative beliefs and promoted temperance, including the prohibition of alcohol and tobacco, played a significant role in the Temperance Movement. American conservative Presbyterian missionaries and World Women's Christian Temperance Union's Christine Isabel Tinling missionaries who received education in believing in Jesus influenced early Korean Christianity. Another influence was the anti-Christian movement in the 1920s. Socialists criticized Christianity as an imperialist tool that enforced acceptance and submission to reality, ignored science, and promoted superstition and falsehoods. In response, within the Korean Christian community, conservative individuals emerged who vehemently opposed socialism. On the other hand, influenced by progressive ideas, Christian nationalists and young people led church reforms. The Rural Enlightenment Movement and Temperance Movement emerged from these developments. Finally, women who were oppressed in the feudal society played a role by organizing organizations like the Chosun YWCA through education and participating in the women's enlightenment movement.\n\n\nThe table below lists some of the temperance movement organizations. Lecture sessions and confinement campaigns were actively conducted, mainly utilizing periods when people gathered in large numbers such as holidays and local markets. They also promoted their cause through Christian newspapers and magazines and worked to enforce temperance and anti-smoking laws among minors. These organizations gathered their strength in a non-denominational manner to carry out nationwide temperance movements.\n\n| Organization | Founded | Constitution | Leaders | Home | Deno. | Career |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Joseon Woman’s Christian Temperance Union | 1924 | Women Christians/ Union & Local Branch leaders | Son, Mary(1885-1963) |  | M |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Lee, Hyo-deok (1895-1978) | Pyongnam | M | 3/1 move.Songjuk-hoe |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Jang, Jeong-sim (1898-1947) | Gaeseong | M | Victory of the Lord |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Kim, Seon | Pyongbuk | M | Joseon Women Education Association |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Choi, Hwal-ran | Incheon | M | Patriotic Women Comrade Society |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Yoo, Gak-gyeong | Seoul | P | YWCA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Joseon Christian Temperance Union | 1932 | Presbyterian men | Song, Sang-seok (1896-1980) | Masan | P |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Chae, Phil-geun (1885-1973 | Pyongnam | P | Daehanmun Incident |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Methodist Church | 1912~ | Temperance office | Kim, Chang-jun (1888-?) | Pyongnam | M |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Kim, Jong-woo (1883-1940) | Ganghwa | M |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Presbyterian Church | No specialized office | Individual churches With the Christian Endeavor  | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nTable was adapted and modified from Yoon (2001). p. 11. \n\n\nIn 1876, as a result of events such as the opening of Korea to the world and the First Sino-Japanese War, many Japanese, including military personnel, began immigrating to Korea. With their arrival, Japanese individuals began engaging in organized prostitution. The first licensed prostitute (공창 licensed prostitute) appeared in Busan in 1902. This marked the emergence of a system where prostitution activities were officially recognized and regulated by the central or local government. As this system became established, the number of licensed prostitutes, which was 6,018 in 1916, increased to 15,623 by 1942. Initially, there were many Japanese hostesses, but later, Koreans became overwhelmingly predominant. One of the reasons for this shift was the worsening economic situation due to Japanese exploitation.\n\n\nThe licensed prostitution system was also closely tied to women's rights issues. Most hostesses were unable to receive the promised wages, suffered from abuse, and accrued debts. They also faced various sexually transmitted diseases. The Purification Movement, which aimed to abolish licensed prostitution, was one of the aspects of the Temperance Movement. It was influenced by international movements, especially the international treaty prohibiting the trafficking of women and children, in which 20 countries participated in 1921. Japan joined the treaty on September 30, 1921, with two reservations.\n\n\nKorean missionaries raised the issue of abolishing the prostitution system along with other religious demands at the Joint Conference of Korean Missionaries held on September 25, 1919. The movement to abolish licensed prostitution by Koreans began in earnest in the mid-1920s. Organizations such as the Society for the Abolition of Licensed Prostitution and the Korean Women's Christian Temperance Union were formed, and activities were conducted not only within denominations but also through inter-denominational collaboration. The Society for the Abolition of Licensed Prostitution soon organized large-scale lecture sessions, published enlightenment and propaganda pamphlets, and established protective agencies. In the following year, they submitted a petition for the abolition of licensed prostitution to the colonial government, jointly with the Foreign Missionaries' Association and the Japanese Christian Youth Association.\n\n\nThe movements conducted independently by the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church, as well as the cooperative efforts with the Christian Endeavor, are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Organizations | Campaign/Activities |\n| --- | --- |\n| Koren Missionary Association | 1919.09.25-29.

L. Swallen through the evangelism efforts of his friend, Park Tae-hwan. During this time, he had a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit. Kim Ik-doo became a Christian and experienced the Holy Spirit through a three-day period of fasting and prayer. His early ministry was centered around Jangryeong Church and Sincheon Church. He began his theological education at Pyongyang Theological Seminary in 1906, was ordained as a pastor in 1910, and subsequently served at various churches. From 1922 to 1927, he ministered at Seoul Nammoon Church, and from 1928 to 1933, he served at Sincheon Church. Starting in 1934, he continued his ministry at Seoul Seungdong Church. Throughout his pastoral career, Kim Ik-doo prayed for the sick, resulting in reported healings. His first documented healing occurred between 1901 and 1903 at Jangryeong Church when he prayed earnestly to heal a gravely ill son of a believer.\n\nHowever, there was a period when he refrained from praying for healing due to discouragement when his prayers for a paralyzed person at Sincheon Church did not yield the desired results. It was only in October 1919, while discussing Mark 16:17-18 with Pastor Jeong Seok-jong of Yeolbae Church in Gangdong County, Pyeongannam-do, that his faith in healing was reignited. Shortly after returning to Sincheon Church, a month later, a healing miracle occurred when he prayed for Hah Kyung-soon, a believer who was seriously ill. From this point on, the manifestation of healing miracles became a significant aspect of Kim Ik-doo's revival movement. Starting in 1920, his healing revival meetings attracted large crowds, sometimes numbering in the thousands. In 1920, a temporary marketplace was set up in Hwanghae Province, Suncheon, due to the massive gathering of people. In Seoul, as many as 5,000 people attended these meetings. Powerful manifestations of the Holy Spirit resulted in numerous healings. During the Busan revival meeting in May 1920, a mute person began to speak, and a paralyzed individual started walking. Initially, Kim Ik-doo prayed for the sick individually. Then, due to the overwhelming number of people seeking healing, they were grouped by specific illnesses and prayed for separately. In the third stage, which began in 1920 during a revival meeting in Seoul, healing occurred primarily through the faith of the sick person, and they were healed simply by looking at Pastor Kim Ik-doo. The healing ministry became a central theme in his revival movement.\n\nKim Ik-doo's healing ministry generated significant interest and controversy in society. Intellectuals, communist activists, and liberal theologians criticized his healing ministry as a departure from the truth of Christianity, accusing him of promoting superstition. Critics harbored strong doubts about the healings and, at times, resorted to physical violence during revival meetings. Communist activists particularly targeted Kim Ik-doo, organizing events like the \"Kim Ik-doo Charlatan Expose Rally,\" where they denounced him as a \"high-level shaman\" and criticized him for his supposed superstitions. The attacks intensified in 1926, reaching a peak during the Yongjeong revival meeting. Communist activists surrounded the church, disrupted Kim Ik-doo's sermons, and even physically assaulted elders and pastors, including A. R. Ross. Church property was vandalized, and several people were injured. In May of the same year, at Iri Church, they faced further challenges during a religious counter-protest organized by local activists in Jeollabuk-do.\n\n\nDespite the controversies and opposition, Kim Ik-doo and his followers understood the healings as evidence of God's ongoing work in the world. Additionally, his healing ministry contributed to the revitalization of the Korean Christian community, which had suffered greatly due to Japanese colonization and exploitation, and helped it expand once again.\n\n양현표.

(Lee, Chan-young. “Misunderstandings and Clarifications about Pastor Kim Ik-du.” Newsletter of the Institute for the History of Korean Christianity, no. 68 (2004): 3–16.)\n\n\nProgressive Creation \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nCheondogyo\n\n\nCheondoism was the largest religious movement in the 1920s, with the most significant following. According to statistics at the time, Cheondoism had approximately 2 million believers. This number of believers was nearly six times larger than the second-ranked Christianity, which had around 350,000 believers. Considering that the Korean population was around 18 million at that time, the fact that Cheondoism had 2 million followers indicates that a significant portion of Koreans believed in Cheondoism. This clearly demonstrates that Cheondoism was the largest single religion in terms of size.\n\nAs the year 1924 approached, colonial Korean society witnessed significant changes in the social landscape. Socialist forces were experiencing rapid growth. In April 1924, socialist forces established the Chosun Youth Alliance, a youth movement organization. The Chosun Youth Alliance was the first nationwide organization of socialist forces, formed through the collaboration of various youth organizations in Seoul, newly emerging youth groups, and the Chosun Youth Federation. The Chosun Youth Alliance attracted significant attention, not only from movement organizations but also culturally, as socialist ideology rapidly spread throughout colonial Korean society.\n\nDue to this changing social atmosphere, Cheondoist forces were also influenced to some extent by socialist ideology. First, there was an increase in the introduction of socialist movements and ideologies through the pages of progressive journals, and individuals with socialist tendencies within the Cheondoist ranks gradually strengthened their beliefs. From 1924 onwards, socialist influences began to be increasingly noticeable within the claims and statements made by Cheondoist forces. In March 1924, Yi Don-hwa published an article titled \"Differences Between the Three Major World Religions and the Daily Life of Cheondoists\" in the Kaebek E, where he quoted Kroptkin, asserting that the root cause of human misconduct lay in the social system. He believed that by completely reforming the social system, the evils of human society could be eliminated.\n\nThe changing consciousness within Cheondoist forces also extended to religious issues. They began to move beyond the broad concept of criticizing \"established religions\" and started to develop more specific content. Critiques began to target the religions among the \"established religions\" that were most closely associated with social problems. These criticisms started emerging from 1924, and one of the chosen targets of Cheondoist criticism was Christianity.\n\nAt the time, Christianity was the largest among the officially recognized religions in terms of size. It had close political ties with the Korean Government-General and, economically, had established foundations with considerable assets. Therefore, Christianity was positioned closely to the socioeconomic elite of society. Prominent Christians, such as Sin Heung-woo, although not entirely denouncing Christianity as capitalism, did acknowledge that it was being exploited by the capitalist class. Cheondoism sharply criticized the problems associated with Christianity, as they saw it as a significant part of the social issues present at that time. However, Cheondoism did not criticize Christianity as a religion itself, as doing so would have implied potential backlash towards their own beliefs. Thus, Cheondoism's opposition to religion by religious forces remained primarily an intellectual movement through the pages of the Kaebek E rather than a comprehensive mass movement.\n\n최보민.

Prior to 1925, there had been declarations of opposition to religion by socialist forces, but they were mostly of a theoretical nature aimed at religion in general. However, at the 1925 conference, Christianity as a religion was explicitly mentioned, distinguishing it from previous declarations. Although the conference was not allowed to take place due to interference from the Japanese police, the confiscated documents included statements criticizing capitalism and imperialism, with a central focus on criticizing Christianity.\n\nThe close association of Christianity with the capitalist class was a significant reason for socialist opposition. Particularly, the socialist forces, including those who formed the Chosun Communist Party, held radical views. The Chosun Communist Party advocated for a direct proletarian revolution that skipped the stage of national revolution, emphasizing a thorough class revolution centered on laborers and peasants. Given this radical stance, it was only natural for the Chosun Communist Party to criticize Christianity, which was closely associated with the capitalist class.\n\nHowever, in addition to the influence of radical revolutionary views, another factor to consider is the policy of the Korean Communist Party related to the National Unification Front. During its founding in 1925, the Korean Communist Party adhered to the principle of rejecting \"compromising\" or \"reformist\" elements within the National Unification Front. Similarly, the Korean Communist Party and the Communist Youth League held similar policies. They advocated forming a National Unification Front with \"revolutionary\" elements and identified Cheondoism as one of the revolutionary forces that could be part of the Unification Front. However, they believed that Christianity needed to be exposed for its true nature.\n\nIn 1925, at the Third Regular Meeting, the New Youth League adopted its action plan, which included a resolution regarding religious issues as the seventh item. The resolution, similar to those discussed in the People's Movement Activists Conference, criticized religion, particularly Christianity, as an institution that supported the capitalist class. The execution of this plan was entrusted to the Intelligence Committee.\n\nIn September 1925, during the Fourth Regular Meeting, the New Youth League established its plan for an anti-Christian movement. They decided to create and distribute pamphlets against Christianity and organize large and small gatherings to promote the movement. Through propaganda and rallies, they aimed to expand the anti-Christian movement.\n\nHowever, the plans adopted at the Fourth Regular Meeting were not implemented effectively due to intense pressure from the Japanese authorities. The colonial authorities were highly sensitive to the activities of socialist individuals related to religion. The police prohibited the dissemination of information related to the anti-Christian movement based on the resolution of the Third Regular Meeting. The reasons given for these measures were that they could harm public morals, revealing the colonial authorities' determination to prevent any issues that could become social problems.\n\nNevertheless, on October 7, 1925, news spread through newspapers that the Second All-Korea Sunday School Conference was going to be held. In response, a large-scale anti-Christian movement was planned. The Han-yang Youth League was the main organizer of this movement. Formed in early August 1925, the Han-yang Youth League was a coalition organization of youth groups in the vicinity of Keijo (now Seoul). On October 21, 1925, the Second All-Korea Sunday School Conference took place, attracting thousands of Christians from across the nation. The exact number of attendees was reported to be around 3,000. To accommodate the large crowd, the conference was divided into two locations: Insadong and Jongno. It was a significant event with various activities such as lectures on psychology, teaching methods, and religious sermons.\n\nDuring the conference, anti-Christian sermons were banned by the police. When the Han-yang Youth League's anti-Christian lecture meeting was canceled, it caused a social uproar, leading to public opinion forming in favor of Japanese protection of Christianity. These oppressive measures by the Japanese authorities only fueled the enthusiasm for the anti-Christian movement.\n\nMotivated by this enthusiasm, the Han-yang Youth League designated December 25th as \"Anti-Christian Day\" and resolved to continue various large and small activities, including creating pamphlets and conducting thorough anti-Christian propaganda. However, these efforts by the Han-yang Youth League did not succeed. The reasons included the intense suppression following the Sinuiju Incident, which led to the arrest of most of the Central Executive Committee members of the Communist Youth League, as well as the Korean Communist Party. This practically brought their organizations to the brink of collapse.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Communist Party issued a directive to form a more populist National Unification Front, and a new leadership approved it. The anti-Christian movement came into conflict with the popular National Unification Front, and, in effect, the anti-Christian movement disappeared after 1926. \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nAnti-Missionary Campaign\n\n\nThrough the March 1st Movement (3.1 Movement), the Korean Government-General realized the influence that religious groups, including Christianity, had. After the March 1st Movement, the Korean Government-General aimed to reduce the influence of religious groups as a key policy direction. However, due to the presence of foreign missionaries with ties to Western powers, especially the United States, they could not suppress Christianity forcefully. Therefore, the Korean Government-General had no choice but to weaken the influence of Christianity through a policy of conciliation rather than oppression. The primary target of this conciliation policy was the foreign missionaries who had a significant impact on nearly 90% of Christian believers. However, until 1920, the Korean Government-General had not established a harmonious relationship with foreign missionaries. At that time, foreign missionaries were dissatisfied with the religious policies of the Korean Government-General. In 1915, the Korean Government-General promulgated the Evangelization Regulations, which allowed them to control religion in Korea. These regulations, issued on August 16, 1915, required strict government approval for individuals, facilities, and activities related to religious evangelization. In other words, these regulations restricted any religious organization from engaging in evangelization activities freely without the approval of the Korean Government-General.\n\nAs restrictions on missionary activities increased through the Evangelization Regulations, the dissatisfaction of missionaries grew. This dissatisfaction was expressed during the All-Korea Missionaries Conference held in September 1919, attended by almost all missionary organizations active in Korea at that time. Foreign missionaries submitted a petition to the Korean Government-General during this conference, making suggestions in six areas. Their suggestions were mainly focused on relaxing excessive regulations on missionary activities and guaranteeing freedom for their evangelization efforts. The Korean Government-General began to quickly implement these demands made by foreign missionaries. By 1920, there were some relaxations in the Evangelization Regulations. The Korean Government-General significantly reduced the documentation required for government approval and eliminated fines for violations. While these amendments did not grant complete freedom, they represented a significant relaxation compared to previous restrictions. \n\nThrough the amendments to the Evangelization Regulations, the Korean Government-General partially eased the constraints on missionaries, leading to the approval of missionary organizations as foundations. Starting with the establishment of the Methodist Missionary Society on December 18, 1920, various Christian organizations established their own foundations, and the Korean Government-General granted approval to these foundations. Approval of foundations had long been a goal for Korean Christian organizations as it would legally recognize their rights over the properties they acquired. Thus, the Korean Government-General actively sought to align itself with foreign missionaries through policy changes. The Korean Government-General's active policy changes soon led to the expansion of Christianity. According to statistics from the Korean Government-General, the number of Christian believers, which was 296,487 at the end of 1919, increased to 323,574 by the end of 1920, representing an increase of 27,087 believers within a year. This trend of Christian growth continued beyond 1920. As the Korean Government-General's policies changed, the influence of foreign missionaries grew rapidly.\n\nInitially, foreign missionaries were hesitant to get deeply involved in sensitive political issues. The earlier mentioned dissatisfaction of missionaries primarily focused on the constraints on their missionary activities rather than outright opposition to Japanese rule in Korea. Therefore, when the Korean Government-General implemented more conciliatory policies, foreign missionaries also became more cooperative, aligning themselves with the Korean Government-General. As foreign missionaries gradually aligned with the Korean Government-General, the resentment of Koreans who had previously viewed them very favorably began to grow. Koreans' changing perceptions of foreign missionaries were particularly evident in the schools they operated. In October 1922, a boycott occurred at a private missionary school in Keijo (Seoul). Over 100 students, enrolled in regular and supplementary courses, went on strike, citing excessive oppression, authoritarian school management, and outdated education methods. The students were determined to continue the boycott, even if it meant expulsion.\n\nThe school administration responded harshly to the students' actions. On October 20, 1922, they expelled 30 students who had led the boycott and dismissed teachers who had supported the strike. They also sent most of the remaining students back to their hometowns. At that time, the situation was well understood by Samuel A. Moffett, who remarked, \"Those westerners who have been looking at Korea for thirty or forty years have given them the kind of education that was not appropriate for the times.\" In other words, this criticism attributed the causes of the incident to the foreign missionaries who managed the school. This indicates that Koreans were no longer viewing foreign missionaries in a purely positive light.\n\nThe incidents resulting from the racial and discriminatory prejudices of missionaries occurred consecutively, with the 'Hasymer Incident' being a prominent example. In 1925, C. A. Hasymer, a medical missionary affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, operated a hospital in Sunan, Pyeongan Province. That summer, a 12-year-old Korean child from the mission station ate apples from Hasymer's orchard and, as a form of punishment, Hasymer etched the word 'thief' onto the child's cheeks using nitric acid, leaving permanent scars. A year later, a Japanese prosecutor filed charges against Hasymer for this incident, leading to protests and condemnation from Korean Christian youth groups. Eventually, Hasymer was dismissed by the Adventist Church and deported in December of that year. The incident was reported as potentially being used by Japan to promote anti-missionary policies. Consequently, right-wing Japanese organizations began supporting anti-missionary movements. Similar incidents continued, and on December 28-29, 1925, J.R. Mott, the General Secretary of the YMCA, arrived in Seoul with the aim of resolving conflicts between missionaries and Koreans. A meeting called the 'Council of Korean Christian Workers' was held with representatives from both sides, consisting of 31 missionaries and 31 Koreans. This meeting served to ease tensions but also reignited discussions about the need for church reform. A. W. Wasson summarized that during this meeting, \"According to the request of Paul, who said 'be all things to all men,' the missionaries were asked to become more Korean.\" This conflict hindered the growth of the Korean church in the 1920s and 1930s, and the Japanese authorities used it as an excuse to promote anti-missionary policies. This ultimately paved the way for the merger of Korean Christianity with Japanese Christianity. \n\n한규무.
