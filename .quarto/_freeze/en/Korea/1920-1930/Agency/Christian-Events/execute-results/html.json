The colonization of Korea served as a means for Japan to secure essential sustenance and materials as it sought to dominate Asia.\n\nTo achieve this, Japan divided the Korean rural population into tenant farmers and landlords through the land survey project, and it rigorously monitored to prevent the growth of the intermediate class in rural society. The rice harvest, which was 12.7 million suk (䄷, 1 suk  = 144 kg) in 1920, increased to 17.3 million suk by 1928, a growth of 4.6 million suk. However, during the same period, the quantity of rice exported to Japan rose significantly from 1.85 million suk in 1920 to 7.42 million suk in 1928. Consequently, Koreans had their rice production siphoned off to Japan and substituted with millet imported from Manchuria. This, combined with the global economic downturn, led to severe hardship in rural areas.\n\n\nYMCA. The YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) initiated rural social movements. From July 1 to the end of December 1920, they conducted a nationwide tour, sending gospel teams to promote a spirit of challenge among rural youth, encouraging social cohesion, and aiming to improve the economic livelihood of rural communities. They also conducted surveys of rural conditions. The YMCA carried out a restructuring, establishing rural and urban departments within the YMCA Federation in November 1925, appointing five members to each committee. As a result, six city YMCA branches, excluding Pyongyang and Wonsan, collectively initiated rural movements. Among student YMCA branches, institutions like Sungsil School, Youngmyung School (Gongju), Yeongseng School (Hamhung), and Gwangsung High School (Kaeseong) began participating in rural movements.\n\n\nThe YMCA also embarked on a second rural survey. In 1926, Professor Brunner from Columbia University, dispatched by the YMCA International Committee, conducted a one-year survey with Korean scholar Ha Gyeong-deok, culminating in the publication of \"Rural Korea.\" The primary motivations behind this research were to showcase the achievements of the Korean rural movement to the world and to highlight the urgency and importance of rural movements in non-missionary regions. In his research report, Brunner noted, \"The miraculous growth actually began to slow down when the initial rural work became evident.\" He criticized the church for not recognizing the changes in the era, the ideological transformation process of individuals, failure to provide appropriate scientific education, restricting the voice of young individuals, undermining the morale within the church hierarchy, and not understanding the issues and concerns that were spreading among intellectuals. As a result of these criticisms, in 1928, Canadian missionary Barnes, an expert in livestock, horticulture, and poultry, was dispatched along with Clark, a former agricultural administrator. Together with Korean assistants, they engaged in rural enlightenment movements, cooperative association movements, and the training of rural leaders. However, the rural movement faced challenges during the 1930s and 40s due to factors such as the economic depression, constant threats to merge the Korean YMCA into Japan, the imprisonment of prominent leaders like Yun, Chi-ho, and the death of Lee, Sang-jae.\n\n\nYWCA. YWCA's involvement in rural outreach began in 1928 when representatives from the Korean YMCA, including women, participated in the International Missionary Council. This conference marked a turning point in the social consciousness of the Korean church, shifting the focus of Christian activism from urban-centered movements to rural-centered ones. Given that the majority of the Korean population lived in rural areas, and most churchgoers were farmers, this shift in focus was essential.\n\n\nIn the same year, YWCA established its Rural Department, which initiated enlightenment campaigns such as the training of rural women leaders and the promotion of rural women's education. The primary goal of the Rural Women Leaders Training Institute was to elevate the status of rural housewives, instill a sense of their spiritual worth, and promote rational living for the betterment of their communities. The aim was for these women to return to their rural communities, work together with other women, and bring about positive changes in rural life. \n\n\nAnother program was the Rural Women's Education Center, which mainly conducted education through local newspapers. The content of education focused on emotional development, encouragement of industrial cooperatives, and the implementation of home-based supplementary income activities to improve rural economies. The purpose of the rural enlightenment movement was to make rural women realize the urgency of their awakening, as it would lead to the improvement of the rural economy and the preservation of the nation.\n\n\nThis rural movement was particularly exemplified by Choi Yong-sin. The foundation of Choi Yong-sin's rural work was the belief that once illiteracy was eradicated, rural women could raise their level of education through intensive instruction and lectures. This, in turn, would lead to the elevation of the status of rural women, which was essential for the development of the country. Under Choi's guidance, specialized missionary teachers in agriculture, animal husbandry, and poultry farming, such as the Canadian missionary Burns, were dispatched to Korea. They worked alongside Korean assistants to promote rural enlightenment, cooperative movements, and the training of rural leaders.\n\n\nHowever, the rural movement faced challenges during the 1930s and 40s due to factors such as the economic depression, constant threats to merge the Korean YMCA into Japan, the imprisonment of prominent leaders like Yun, Chi-ho, and the death of Lee, Sang-jae.\n\n\nPresbyterian Church. The Presbyterian Church's rural movement began to take shape with a clear social consciousness within the church starting in 1928, following the participation of representatives from the church in the Jerusalem International Missionary Council. In the same year, the church established the Rural Department, initiated the Rural Association, and encouraged children's education in rural areas. In 1929, a conference was held in response to Motte's visit, focusing on topics such as the church's life and work, the need for trained leaders, financial support, spiritual unity, and cooperation in business. Suggestions included more practical preaching of the gospel, Christian ethical commerce, the implementation of the Old Testament, savings, diligence, cooperative associations, and the dispatch of one agricultural specialist missionary to each missionary district. The direction of the Presbyterian Church's rural movement included rural evangelism, rural hygiene, rural education, rural transportation, and rural cooperative movements.\n\n\nMethodist Church.  (This section will be moved to the 1930s decade later.) The Methodist Church had a unique aspect in its rural movement, which was the utilization of unpaid lay preachers. According to statistics from 1937, out of 112 preachers, only 26 were members of the annual conference, another 26 were assistant preachers, and the remaining 60 were unpaid lay preachers. Among these 60, there were 34 farmers, 11 shopkeepers, 6 unemployed individuals, 4 teachers, and 1 each of doctor, agricultural laborer, secretary, and barber. A survey in October 1937 in the Gongju region found that 35 out of 45 worship services were conducted by unpaid lay preachers. Peyton believed that utilizing these individuals could solve the \"economic problem of rural churches.\" In 1931, in villages where 234 churches were located nationwide, two-thirds were supported and developed by such unpaid preachers.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the Methodist Church's rural work was the \"Church Farm Practical Use.\" In 1927, Noble purchased a piece of land to secure church finances. In reality, by 1933, nearly one-third of the 52 Methodist churches had such land, and it was assisting the church finances. Some church lands amounted to 200 jeongbo (1 jeongbo = 3.3 squared meters), while others reached 20,000 jeongbo. On average, each church had about 2 acres of land.\n\n\nThree-quarters of these church lands were leased to tenant farmers, and the rental income contributed to the church budget. The remaining one-quarter was cultivated by church members themselves. The income from these lands was not necessarily substantial; in 1937, the average income was 74 won, which was barely one-fifth of a pastor's annual salary. However, it made a practical contribution to the economic development of rural churches through cash donations, labor contributions, cooperative spirit, and new forms of agricultural improvement and experimentation.\n\n\n  강원돈,\"한국민족민주 운동에 비추어본 한국 기독교(1)\"[신학사상] 1988.봄\n\n  강인규.\"1920년대 반 기독교 운동을 통해서 본 기독교\",[한국기독교사 연구 제9호] .1986.8.\n\n  김병서.\"사회운동의 기독교의 사명\"[기독교사상]1989.5.\n\n 노치준. \"일제하 한국 새신교 운동의 사회학적 연구\", [한국 사회학연구 제 6집]. 1982.6.\n\n\nLiterary Mission Movement\n\nAfter the March 1st Movement, the Japanese colonial government allowed a limited degree of press freedom as a core strategy of \"cultural politics.\" As a result, in the 1920s, newspapers such as Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo, which continue to represent Korea today, were founded. In the Christian community, missionary activities using documents, including newspapers and magazines, became active. The \"Christian Shinbo,\" a joint newspaper founded in 1915 by the Presbyterian and Methodist churches, obtained permission from the colonial government to publish general news articles on politics, diplomacy, society, and more, just like regular newspapers.\n\n\nBefore the March 1st Movement, there were magazines published by missionaries, such as the English magazine \"The Korea Mission Field\" (1905) and denominational magazines like \"Shinhangsegye\" (Theological World) published by the Methodist Hyupsung Theological Seminary (1916) and \"Sinhangjinam\" (Theological South) published by the Presbyterian Pyongyang Theological Seminary (1918). In addition, in the 1920s, magazines like \"Hwalseon\" (1922) from the Holiness Church and \"Sagwan\" (1927) from the Salvation Army were established. Christian organizations also published magazines, including \"Hyundai\" (1920) and \"Jeolmeuni\" (1923) from the Tokyo Chosen YMCA, \"Cheongnyeon\" (1921) from the Seoul YMCA, \"Jooilhakgyojapji\" (Sunday School Magazine) from the Korea Sunday School Union (1925), and \"Jinsaeng\" (1925) from the Christian Endeavor of the Korea United Association. Individual and literary coterie magazines were also actively published.\n\n\nIn the 1910s, there were 21 magazines, in the 1920s, there were 43, in the 1930s, there were 49, and in the 1940s, there were 6, totaling 119 magazines (Han, 1987; Yoon, 2003; The Institute of the History of Christianity in Korea 2, 2019, p. 79). This is evidence that the cultural politics policy of the colonial government influenced the Korean church's interest in missionary work through documents. Leaders of the Korean church, especially figures like Park Seung-bong, Yoo Sung-jun, Yoon Chi-ho, Lee Sang-jae, and Choi Byung-heon of the YMCA, as well as Kim Baek-won, Kim Se-hwan, Kim Chang-jun, Lee Seung-hoon, and Jung No-sik, who played a key role in the March 1st Movement, actively participated in establishing companies specializing in Christian books and the publication of Christian literature.\n\n\nIn 1922, they changed the name from 'Chosun Christian Light Company' to 'Changmunsa' and published magazines like 'Sin Saengmyeong' (New Life) and various books, while actively progressing with the Korean translation of the Bible. In 1925, J.S. Gale and Lee Won-mo jointly translated the 'New Testament' in a way that reflected the contemporary Korean language as much as possible, different from the Bible translated by the Missionary Committee at the time. During this period, the revision and reorganization of the Bible and hymnals also took place actively. 'Gwanju (貫珠, Reference) Seonhanmun Old Testament' (1926) and 'New Testament Commentary' were published for Bible scholars. In 1924, the Korean National Christian Council formed a hymnal committee as its first project and began revising the hymnal published jointly by the Presbyterian and Methodist churches in 1908.\n\n한영재 편, “한국기독교 정기간행물 100년” (기독교문사, 1987), p  25-28\n\n윤춘병, “한국기독교신문, 잡지백년사: 1885-1945” (감리교신학대학교 출판부, 2003). \n\n\nSunday School Movement\n\nThe March 1st Movement sparked significant interest not only among young people but also in child education. Missionary William N. Blair, in particular, focused on the Sunday school movement. In just one year, in 1920, the number of Sunday schools increased from over 10,000 to over 14,000. Additionally, the 1920 World Sunday School Convention held in Japan decided to send world Sunday school leaders to Korea for the next three years to visit and guide Sunday schools nationwide for six months each year, in order to promote the development of Sunday school activities in Korea.\n\nAround the time of the establishment of the Korean Sunday School Union in November 1922, there were three significant events that promoted Sunday school activities in Korea. First, there was the Forward Movement in the Presbyterian Church and the Century Movement in the Methodist Church, both initiated at the denominational level during the September 1919 general assembly, which significantly expanded Sunday school activities in Korea after the March 1st Movement. The 1919 Presbyterian General Assembly decided to carry out a three-year Forward Movement and appointed 36 members, three from each presbytery, to promote the Forward Movement. The goal was to organize in 1919 and achieve remarkable results in the third year, 1921. While not exclusively focused on the Sunday school movement, the key was to rapidly increase church Sunday worship and Sunday school attendance. The explosive growth of Sunday schools after the March 1st Movement was closely related to the Forward Movement and the Century Movement. After the March 1st Movement, the Forward Movement, deeply intertwined with Sunday school activities and revival movements, was conducted nationwide with the Presbyterian Church at its center.\n\nThe Forward Movement was carried out in two periods, from 1919 to 1926 and from 1929 to 1935. The most significant outcome of the Forward Movement was Sunday schools for young people within the church. Over the course of three years from 1920, the Forward Movement provided a crucial foundation for overcoming the crisis in Korea in 1919. During this period, both the number of students and teachers in Korean Presbyterian Sunday schools saw significant growth. After the March 1st Movement, the remarkable growth of Sunday schools in Korea saw a total of 3,899 Sunday schools and 223,732 students in 1921. There was a strong hope among Sunday school activists that through Sunday school education, they could reform the people and expand the church to create a better nation. In this historical context, Sunday schools presented an excellent opportunity to instill Christian values in Korea's youth. The remarkable growth of Sunday schools provided the impetus for attracting young people, who were susceptible to socialist or communist ideologies or moral decay, into the church and offering them new tasks within the church to ignite a new revival movement. Thousands of young people trained in Sunday schools during that era would later grow into outstanding leaders in the Korean church.\n\nAlthough the era of winning new converts had become more challenging, it was believed that \"if Sunday schools prosper, the church will naturally thrive.\" In fact, Yang Joo-sam stated that at the Fourth National Sunday School Convention, 85% of new believers were recruited into the church through Sunday schools. The activation of Sunday schools, in particular, was a response to the contemporary request placed upon the Korean church for effective evangelism and proper education for the upcoming generations.\n\nThe 8th Tokyo World Sunday School Convention and the 1st National Sunday School Convention. The 8th Tokyo World Sunday School Convention held in Japan from October 5th to 14th, 1920, had the \"most direct impact\" on the Sunday school movement in the Korean church. Originally scheduled for 1916, this convention was postponed due to World War I and took place in Tokyo, Japan, in 1920, just one year after the March 1st Movement. Over 300 representatives from various countries who attended the 8th World Sunday School Convention visited Korea to tour and support the Sunday school movement. They traveled to regions with active Sunday schools, including Seoul, Pyongyang, Kaesong, and Daegu, and conducted lectures to promote the Korean Sunday school movement. This atmosphere allowed for the organization of the 1st National Sunday School Convention in 1921, where 960 representatives from all over Korea, including South and North Korea, participated.\n\nThe Establishment and Activities of the Korean Sunday School Union. On November 1, 1922, 27 representatives from 10 organizations gathered at the Episcopal Church meeting room and established the Korean Sunday School Union. The Sunday School Committee, which had existed since 1911, played an important role in the establishment of the Korean Sunday School Union, and the 8th World Sunday School Convention in 1920 and the 1st National Sunday School Convention in 1921 were crucial background events leading to the formation of the Korean Sunday School Union. Among the 27 representatives who attended the founding assembly, there were eight each from the Presbyterian and Northern Methodist Churches, two from the Northern Presbyterian Church Mission, two from the Southern Methodist Church Mission, two from the Northern Methodist Church Mission, one from the Southern Presbyterian Church Mission, one from the Canadian Mission, one from the Australian Presbyterian Mission, one from the Sunday School Union, and one from the Korean Bible Society, totaling 27 members. The president was Oh Cheon-gyeong (Presbyterian), the vice president was Hong Byeong-seon (Methodist), the secretary was Byeon Seong-ok (Methodist), the treasurer was Bang Wi-ryang (Presbyterian). In September 1930, the Korean Sunday School Union also joined the \"World Sunday School Association\" (World Sunday School Association). In 1928, Kim Gwan-sik, Lee Seong-hwi, and Kwak An-ryeon were sent to the World Sunday School Convention held in Los Angeles, USA, strengthening the relationship between the Korean Sunday School Union and the World Sunday School Association. In January 1929, Lacy highly praised the Korean Sunday School Union as follows: \"The Korean Sunday School Union is a growing organization. The number of staff is increasing, and the budget is increasing as well. It has grown from an estimated 9,000 won budgets to over 12,000 won this year. It requests the help and cooperation of many people. The work that the Korean Sunday School Union has prioritized is extensive. In my judgment, the three most important tasks that the Korean Sunday School Union has undertaken before the Liberation War are as follows: First, the publication of documents related to Sunday school education. Second, sending representatives to the World Sunday School Convention to maintain continuous contact with the World Sunday School Association. Third, hosting the National Sunday School Convention in Korea.\"\n\n박용규.

The content of the \"Temperance Movement\" was similar to the \"Moral Reform\" movement that was common at the time and was led by the widespread promotion of temperance, including the Gold-Ju (abstention from alcohol) Movement. It encompassed efforts to abolish gambling, prohibit opium use, and promote moderation in food and clothing. This can be seen as an attempt to overcome the dire socioeconomic conditions by conserving consumption and aligning with the emerging cultural construction, skills development, and spiritual reform movements, all of which were part of the \"Cultural Movement\" that expressed itself through movements such as the \"Cultivation Movement,\" \"Moral Reform Movement,\" and \"Rural Improvement Movement.\"\n\n\nThe Christian temperance ethics, which emphasized abstaining from alcohol and had similarities to Puritanism ethics, were well-suited to the situation where Japan distributed addictive goods like alcohol, tobacco, and opium as part of its economic exploitation through projects like the Land Survey Project and the Increase of Rice Production Project. Japan also introduced state-regulated prostitution known as the \"Gongchang system,\" which encouraged debauchery. Liquor and tobacco taxes were imposed as well. The Christian temperance movement was triggered by these circumstances.\n\n\nThe influence of missionary personnel who held conservative beliefs and promoted temperance, including the prohibition of alcohol and tobacco, played a significant role in the Temperance Movement. American conservative Presbyterian missionaries and World Women's Christian Temperance Union's Christine Isabel Tinling missionaries who received education in believing in Jesus influenced early Korean Christianity. Another influence was the anti-Christian movement in the 1920s. Socialists criticized Christianity as an imperialist tool that enforced acceptance and submission to reality, ignored science, and promoted superstition and falsehoods. In response, within the Korean Christian community, conservative individuals emerged who vehemently opposed socialism. On the other hand, influenced by progressive ideas, Christian nationalists and young people led church reforms. The Rural Enlightenment Movement and Temperance Movement emerged from these developments. Finally, women who were oppressed in the feudal society played a role by organizing organizations like the Chosun YWCA through education and participating in the women's enlightenment movement.\n\n\nThe table below lists some of the temperance movement organizations. Lecture sessions and confinement campaigns were actively conducted, mainly utilizing periods when people gathered in large numbers such as holidays and local markets. They also promoted their cause through Christian newspapers and magazines and worked to enforce temperance and anti-smoking laws among minors. These organizations gathered their strength in a non-denominational manner to carry out nationwide temperance movements.\n\n| Organization | Founded | Constitution | Leaders | Home | Deno. | Career |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Joseon Woman’s Christian Temperance Union | 1924 | Women Christians/ Union & Local Branch leaders | Son, Mary(1885-1963) |  | M |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Lee, Hyo-deok (1895-1978) | Pyongnam | M | 3/1 move.Songjuk-hoe |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Jang, Jeong-sim (1898-1947) | Gaeseong | M | Victory of the Lord |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Kim, Seon | Pyongbuk | M | Joseon Women Education Association |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Choi, Hwal-ran | Incheon | M | Patriotic Women Comrade Society |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Yoo, Gak-gyeong | Seoul | P | YWCA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Joseon Christian Temperance Union | 1932 | Presbyterian men | Song, Sang-seok (1896-1980) | Masan | P |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Chae, Phil-geun (1885-1973 | Pyongnam | P | Daehanmun Incident |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Methodist Church | 1912~ | Temperance office | Kim, Chang-jun (1888-?) | Pyongnam | M |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NA | NA | NA | Kim, Jong-woo (1883-1940) | Ganghwa | M |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Presbyterian Church | No specialized office | Individual churches With the Christian Endeavor  | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nTable was adapted and modified from Yoon (2001). p. 11. \n\n\nIn 1876, as a result of events such as the opening of Korea to the world and the First Sino-Japanese War, many Japanese, including military personnel, began immigrating to Korea. With their arrival, Japanese individuals began engaging in organized prostitution. The first licensed prostitute (공창 licensed prostitute) appeared in Busan in 1902. This marked the emergence of a system where prostitution activities were officially recognized and regulated by the central or local government. As this system became established, the number of licensed prostitutes, which was 6,018 in 1916, increased to 15,623 by 1942. Initially, there were many Japanese hostesses, but later, Koreans became overwhelmingly predominant. One of the reasons for this shift was the worsening economic situation due to Japanese exploitation.\n\n\nThe licensed prostitution system was also closely tied to women's rights issues. Most hostesses were unable to receive the promised wages, suffered from abuse, and accrued debts. They also faced various sexually transmitted diseases. The Purification Movement, which aimed to abolish licensed prostitution, was one of the aspects of the Temperance Movement. It was influenced by international movements, especially the international treaty prohibiting the trafficking of women and children, in which 20 countries participated in 1921. Japan joined the treaty on September 30, 1921, with two reservations.\n\n\nKorean missionaries raised the issue of abolishing the prostitution system along with other religious demands at the Joint Conference of Korean Missionaries held on September 25, 1919. The movement to abolish licensed prostitution by Koreans began in earnest in the mid-1920s. Organizations such as the Society for the Abolition of Licensed Prostitution and the Korean Women's Christian Temperance Union were formed, and activities were conducted not only within denominations but also through inter-denominational collaboration. The Society for the Abolition of Licensed Prostitution soon organized large-scale lecture sessions, published enlightenment and propaganda pamphlets, and established protective agencies. In the following year, they submitted a petition for the abolition of licensed prostitution to the colonial government, jointly with the Foreign Missionaries' Association and the Japanese Christian Youth Association.\n\n\nThe movements conducted independently by the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church, as well as the cooperative efforts with the Christian Endeavor, are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Organizations | Campaign/Activities |\n| --- | --- |\n| Koren Missionary Association | 1919.09.25-29.
