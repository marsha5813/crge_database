L. Swallen through the evangelism efforts of his friend, Park Tae-hwan. During this time, he had a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit. Kim Ik-doo became a Christian and experienced the Holy Spirit through a three-day period of fasting and prayer. His early ministry was centered around Jangryeong Church and Sincheon Church. He began his theological education at Pyongyang Theological Seminary in 1906, was ordained as a pastor in 1910, and subsequently served at various churches. From 1922 to 1927, he ministered at Seoul Nammoon Church, and from 1928 to 1933, he served at Sincheon Church. Starting in 1934, he continued his ministry at Seoul Seungdong Church. Throughout his pastoral career, Kim Ik-doo prayed for the sick, resulting in reported healings. His first documented healing occurred between 1901 and 1903 at Jangryeong Church when he prayed earnestly to heal a gravely ill son of a believer.\n\nHowever, there was a period when he refrained from praying for healing due to discouragement when his prayers for a paralyzed person at Sincheon Church did not yield the desired results. It was only in October 1919, while discussing Mark 16:17-18 with Pastor Jeong Seok-jong of Yeolbae Church in Gangdong County, Pyeongannam-do, that his faith in healing was reignited. Shortly after returning to Sincheon Church, a month later, a healing miracle occurred when he prayed for Hah Kyung-soon, a believer who was seriously ill. From this point on, the manifestation of healing miracles became a significant aspect of Kim Ik-doo's revival movement. Starting in 1920, his healing revival meetings attracted large crowds, sometimes numbering in the thousands. In 1920, a temporary marketplace was set up in Hwanghae Province, Suncheon, due to the massive gathering of people. In Seoul, as many as 5,000 people attended these meetings. Powerful manifestations of the Holy Spirit resulted in numerous healings. During the Busan revival meeting in May 1920, a mute person began to speak, and a paralyzed individual started walking. Initially, Kim Ik-doo prayed for the sick individually. Then, due to the overwhelming number of people seeking healing, they were grouped by specific illnesses and prayed for separately. In the third stage, which began in 1920 during a revival meeting in Seoul, healing occurred primarily through the faith of the sick person, and they were healed simply by looking at Pastor Kim Ik-doo. The healing ministry became a central theme in his revival movement.\n\nKim Ik-doo's healing ministry generated significant interest and controversy in society. Intellectuals, communist activists, and liberal theologians criticized his healing ministry as a departure from the truth of Christianity, accusing him of promoting superstition. Critics harbored strong doubts about the healings and, at times, resorted to physical violence during revival meetings. Communist activists particularly targeted Kim Ik-doo, organizing events like the \"Kim Ik-doo Charlatan Expose Rally,\" where they denounced him as a \"high-level shaman\" and criticized him for his supposed superstitions. The attacks intensified in 1926, reaching a peak during the Yongjeong revival meeting. Communist activists surrounded the church, disrupted Kim Ik-doo's sermons, and even physically assaulted elders and pastors, including A. R. Ross. Church property was vandalized, and several people were injured. In May of the same year, at Iri Church, they faced further challenges during a religious counter-protest organized by local activists in Jeollabuk-do.\n\n\nDespite the controversies and opposition, Kim Ik-doo and his followers understood the healings as evidence of God's ongoing work in the world. Additionally, his healing ministry contributed to the revitalization of the Korean Christian community, which had suffered greatly due to Japanese colonization and exploitation, and helped it expand once again.\n\n양현표.
