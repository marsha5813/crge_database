The Provisional Government's diplomatic efforts focused on forging ties with key global powers, particularly China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, although these efforts met with varying degrees of success. \n\n\nThe Provisional Government established its base in Shanghai, a city that offered a degree of political autonomy under the Chinese Republic, and it benefited from the relatively tolerant stance of the Chinese government toward Korean exiles. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party), offered moral support to the Korean independence cause. However, China's own internal struggles, including the warlord era and the rise of the Communist Party, limited its ability to offer significant material support.\n\n\nThe Provisional Government made considerable efforts to engage with the United States, largely through the Korean National Association and Korean-Americans who lobbied the U.S. government for recognition of Korean independence. Syngman Rhee, one of the key figures of the Provisional Government, sought to garner U.S. support by appealing to the principles of democracy and self-determination espoused by President Woodrow Wilson. However, the U.S. government, prioritizing its relations with Japan and focusing on post-World War I reconstruction, was reluctant to antagonize Japan and did not officially recognize the Provisional Government.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom, like the United States, had significant geopolitical interests in East Asia and was generally supportive of Japan's role in the region following World War I. The British government, therefore, was cautious in its approach to the Korean independence movement and did not extend formal recognition to the Provisional Government. British policy during this time was characterized by a desire to maintain stability and its own colonial interests rather than support independence movements in Asia.\n\n\nThe Provisional Government of Korea had a mixed relationship with the Soviet Union. While some factions within the Korean independence movement were sympathetic to communist ideas, others were wary of aligning too closely with the Soviets due to ideological differences and fears of Soviet domination. The Soviet Union, for its part, offered some support to Korean independence fighters, particularly those who were aligned with communist ideals, but this support was inconsistent and often influenced by the Soviets' shifting priorities in East Asia.\n\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Soviet Union provided refuge to some Korean independence activists and allowed them to organize and train within its borders. This included support for armed resistance groups operating in the Russian Far East and Manchuria. However, the relationship was often strained, as the Soviet Union's primary focus was on consolidating its own power and spreading communism, rather than supporting Korean nationalism per se.\n\n\nDespite the lack of formal recognition from these major powers, the diplomatic efforts of the Provisional Government in the 1920s laid the groundwork for future international advocacy. The Provisional Government's persistent appeals to global powers helped keep the issue of Korean independence alive in international forums, even if tangible support was limited during this period.\n\n ",
