This period saw a relaxation of thought control through religion in Japan due to the influx of liberal democratic ideas. The Japanese government's efforts to control public thought through religion and to maximize the social role of religion led to the proposal of the Religious Bill (宗敎法案) in 1898. However, it was shelved due to opposition from the religious community, only to resurface in the late 1920s in connection with the Great Kanto Earthquake (1923) and the global economic depression.\n\n\nConcerned that the implementation of this Religious Bill in Japan would inevitably affect Korea, the Korean Christian community, led by Pastor Han Kyung-jik (쏟 general Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Kore, 朝鮮耶蘇敎長老會), submitted a petition to the Government-General of Korea opposing the enactment of the bill (1926). A vigorous opposition movement also developed in Japan. Nevertheless, Japan's efforts to control public thought were not absent. In 1923, the \"Imperial Rescript on the Promotion of National Spirit\" and, in April 1925, the \"Peace Preservation Law\" were enacted to strengthen control over public thought in Japan. In Korea, following the March 1st Movement, missionaries and Korean church leaders were wary of religion becoming a tool for thought control.\n\n\nChristian private schools were the core of secret societies, organizing and spreading the independence movement across the nation. Influenced by the principle of national self-determination, the harsh suppression of Korea's independence movement at the Paris Peace Conference, and negative views on colonial rule, there was a shift in religious and private school policies. This marked the beginning of the so-called 'Cultural Rule' era. \n\nIronically, perhaps due to the relaxation policy, this was also the period when the most pro-Japanese collaborators emerged and advanced into society.\n\n\nIn 1919, the union missionary conference submitted a petition to the Governor-General with the following six requests:\n\nFirst, regarding the promotion of missionary work, the following modifications are requested from the Government-General:\n\nRelax the control over churches and missionaries.\n\nEnsure that officials of the Government-General do not discriminate against Christianity and Christians.\n\nEncourage the Government-General to uphold the rights of petition and appeal.\n\n\nSecond, regarding educational activities, the following modifications are requested from the Government-General:\n\nAllow Bible teaching and religious ceremonies to be included in the curriculum of private schools operated by Christian principles.\n\nAbolish restrictions on the use of the Korean language.\n\nProvide more freedom than currently given in the management of private schools and eliminate unnecessary interference by government officials.\n\nRecognize the freedom of conscience for students.\n\nProvide Koreans with equal educational opportunities as Japanese and grant more freedom in the selection of textbooks, as well as lift restrictions on teaching Korean and world history.\n\nGrant the same privileges to graduates of private schools approved by the Government-General as those given to graduates of corresponding public schools.\n\nCease excessive property demands on private schools.\n\n\nThird, regarding healthcare activities, request changes in the Government-General's stance:\n\nDelegate the detailed management of private hospitals to the hospital staff and avoid interference by the Government-General.\n\n\nFourth, regarding religion and literature:\n\nAbolish censorship of Christian-related books.\n\nAllow Christian newspapers, magazines, and other publications to cover not only church-related matters but also broader religious literature, removing the restrictions of the 1911 \"Publication Ordinance.\"\n\nEnsure that local authorities do not interfere with the sale of Bibles, pamphlets, and other Christian literature by peddlers and businesses.\n\n\nFifth, regarding property ownership and financial matters:\n\nAllow Korean churches and missionary groups to own and register property in their names by granting them corporate status.\n\nRelax the current strict regulations on obtaining permits for collecting donations for hospitals, schools, and charitable activities.\n\nDraw attention to the destruction of churches and other properties by officials of the Government-General without compensation to this day.\n\n\nSixth, regarding moral improvements:\n\nOppose the laws regarding the establishment of licensed quarters.\n\nDemand amendments to laws affecting the production, manufacture, and sale of opium and morphine.\n\nRevise the laws on the sale of alcohol and restore traditional local options, allowing communities to prohibit the establishment of bars according to their wishes.\n\nApply the age restrictions for minors on smoking to Korean minors as well.\n\nEnact laws to restrict child labor and improve conditions for workers in factories and mines.\n\nEnsure that Christian inmates in prison are not forced to work on Sundays or engage in tasks against their conscience.\n\nGrant privileges that aid the religious and moral improvement of inmates.\n\n\nIn March 1920, the 'Private School Regulations' were revised, and the previous provision (Article 6-2), which prohibited the addition of courses beyond those prescribed in the regulations for ordinary, higher ordinary, girls' higher ordinary, vocational, and specialized schools, was deleted. This allowed missionaries to teach the Bible as a subject, a proposal they had made in 1919.\n\n\nThe Propagation Regulations were also revised in April 1920. The amount of required information to be reported was minimized, and penalties were reduced. However, the newly established authority of the Governor-General to suspends or prohibit the use of religious facilities' indicated that, despite the appearance of relaxation, control was actually strengthened.\n\n\nA key issue during this period was the incorporation 財團法人 of religious organizations. In 1920, the Korean Civil Ordinance 朝鮮民事令was revised to permit foundations established for the purpose of religious propagation to be recognized as public interest corporations and domestic legal entities. This was very important because, in Korea, once religious organizations obtained corporate status, they could manage and maintain their basic assets. The Catholic Church was the first to achieve incorporation, unlike the Protestant Church, which did not openly express opposition to the Governor-General of Korea. The Catholic Church also continuously worked within its community to protect its assets. Protestant denominations founded their own incorporated foundations as below. While this could be seen as a softening of Christian policy through dialogue with missionaries, it can also be viewed as placing church and school assets under the control of the Governor-General of Korea. Although 'Cultural Rule' was promoted, ostensibly relaxing control over religious education and missionary activities, the legal restrictions on church assets and the freedom of assembly were actually tightened.\n\n\nTable 1.
