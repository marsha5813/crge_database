Upon arrival, Rhee immediately emerged as a central political figure and expressed his vision for a Christian-based nation. At his first official service at Jeongdong First Methodist Church, he declared his intent to “build a new nation upon the Word of the Bible,” revealing a governing philosophy rooted in Protestant Christian ideals rather than mere personal faith.\n\nSoon after his return, Rhee organized a political base centered on Protestant leadership, forming the Korean National Independence Promotion Association with prominent pastors and church elders such as Lee Yoon-young and Bae Eun-hee. He also forged close ties with U.S. intelligence networks and Protestant figures affiliated with the OSS. During this time, Rhee portrayed communism as synonymous with atheism, strategically aligning anti-communism with Christian faith as a unified national ideology.\n\nIn 1948, as the Republic of Korea was established and Rhee was elected its first president, his religious orientation became explicitly embedded in state rituals. The first National Assembly was opened with a Christian prayer by Pastor Lee Yoon-young, and Rhee’s inaugural address included a pledge “before God and the people,” reaffirming the theological legitimacy of his rule. His initial cabinet was heavily weighted with Protestants, reflecting an effort to establish Christian principles at the core of national governance.\n\nThis religious inclination also appeared in social and economic policies. Most notably, land reform efforts were interpreted by Rhee as the realization of biblical justice. Article 86 of the 1948 Constitution, which mandated the redistribution of land to tenant farmers, was framed not only as a countermeasure to communist reform but also as an expression of Christian socio-economic ethics—an attempt to embody justice and stewardship through state policy\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 intensified Rhee’s anti-communist posture and his reliance on Christianity as a moral and ideological pillar. Stories of persecution of Christians in North Korea, including the martyrdom of Pastor Sohn Yang-won and Elder Cho Man-sik, were highlighted to portray Christianity as a defender of national freedom. During the war, Rhee institutionalized Christian influence through the establishment of military chaplaincy and prison chaplaincy systems. He also supported the founding of Christian media such as CBS (1954) and Far East Broadcasting Company (1956) and even modified national rituals by replacing compulsory flag salutes with a “gaze of respect,” aligning with Christian objections to idolatry. However, Rhee’s religious policy extended beyond favoritism toward Protestant Christianity; it also entailed direct intervention in and control over other religions. In the 1954–60 period, the government became involved in internal religious conflicts, exacerbating divisions and using them to assert control.\n\nIn Buddhism, Rhee issued the so-called Jeonghwa Yusi (“Purification Edict”) in 1954 during a heated dispute between celibate monks (bigu) and married priests (daechoseung). Although the edict played a role in restructuring the Buddhist order under celibate leadership, it violated the National Assembly’s resolution prohibiting state interference in religion. While some later interpreted the edict as a corrective reform, it also became the origin of prolonged division and violence within Korean Buddhism.\n\nIn Confucian circles, Rhee sided with the Nong-eun faction and was nominated as head of the Confucian Association, marginalizing the traditionalist Jeongtong faction led by Kim Chang-sook. This move strengthened his political influence while weakening Confucian autonomy. Meanwhile, new religious movements were often labeled as pseudo-religions or cults, with their leaders arrested—indicating a substantial infringement on constitutionally guaranteed religious freedom.\n\nAs Rhee’s rule grew increasingly authoritarian, Christianity was no longer just a foundational ideal but an instrument of governance. His 1952 constitutional amendment to allow direct presidential elections, the 1954 third-term amendment, and the centralization of power around Protestant aides like Lee Ki-boong and Lee Gap-seong illustrated how religion and power were tightly intertwined. However, the 1960 March 15 rigged election provoked nationwide protests, culminating in the April 19 Revolution. Rhee eventually stepped down, declaring he was yielding to the “will of the people.” His resignation marked the end of a political-religious experiment in using Christianity as a state ideology.\n\n\nTable 1.

Han Kyung-jik responded promptly with both religious and humanitarian action. In August of the same year, he established the Christian National Salvation Association (기독교구국회) in Busan. This organization provided relief for refugees, supported soldiers, and organized national prayer rallies. For Han, these efforts were not simply emergency responses—they were expressions of a theological conviction that the church must serve as a moral and institutional anchor for the Korean nation in times of crisis​.\n\nHan's work during this period cannot be separated from his central theological and political idea: the Doctrine of Nation-Building through Evangelization (傳道立國論, Jeondo-Ipgukron). First developed in the immediate aftermath of Korea’s liberation in 1945, this concept held that the church—modeled on the representative system of Presbyterian governance—could produce democratic citizens through its evangelistic and educational functions. The more churches were planted, Han believed, the more people would be trained in democratic principles, thus enabling the establishment of a Christian democratic nation. He famously declared that “evangelism is the greatest political movement,” emphasizing the church’s ability to guide national development not only spiritually but also socially and politically​.\n\nIn the 1950s, Han Kyung-jik put this doctrine into action, particularly through the development of Youngnak Church in Seoul. The church, founded to serve war refugees from North Korea, became a base for a wide range of ministries, including orphanages, hospitals, schools, and welfare organizations. These activities reflected Han’s commitment to a form of Christian mission that was not limited to preaching but also included the structural reconstruction of society. His theological commitment to serving the poor and vulnerable was deepened during a period of personal illness in the U.S., where he drew inspiration from figures like St. Francis of Assisi and Leo Tolstoy. This influence led him to prioritize social service and compassion as core elements of his pastoral and theological identity​​.\n\nPolitically, Han did not remain on the sidelines. In the 1952 presidential election, he played a key role in rallying Protestant support for Syngman Rhee, whom he described as a Christian president. Furthermore, he endorsed Pastor Ham Tae-young for the vice presidency. These endorsements reflected Han’s belief that political engagement was not only permissible but necessary for Christians in Korea. Contrary to the abstract notion of the separation of church and state, Han advocated what might be called a public theology of engagement. As Kim Do-hyung observes, Han saw the church’s participation in politics not merely as a right but as a duty in the face of national and ideological crisis​.\n\nIn 1955, Han was elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea, a position that cemented his leadership in the broader Protestant community. From this position, he expanded his influence not only in evangelism but also in education, social reform, and national policy. Throughout this time, anti-communism was central to his theology and public messaging. Based on his traumatic experience in North Korea before his defection, Han viewed communism not simply as a political alternative but as a spiritual enemy—a satanic force that threatened both the church and the nation. In sermons and publications, he often described communism as the “red dragon,” echoing apocalyptic imagery from the Book of Revelation. This theological framing gave moral urgency to the church’s resistance to communism and legitimized its support for South Korea’s anti-communist regime​​.\n\nHan’s anti-communist stance also reflected his alignment with the Christian nationalist movement that emerged during the post-liberation period. Alongside leaders like Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, and Syngman Rhee, he argued that Christianity should serve as the moral foundation of the newly forming Korean state. This belief was articulated most clearly in his 1949 sermon collection Christianity and Nation-Building (건국과 기독교), which was compiled from messages delivered at Youngnak Church between 1946 and 1947. In these sermons, Han contrasted Christian democracy with atheistic republicanism and communism, emphasizing the former as Korea’s best and only option for a just and free future​.\n\nThrough these efforts, Han Kyung-jik contributed not only to the physical reconstruction of postwar Korea but also to the shaping of its ideological and moral foundations. His synthesis of evangelism, welfare, anti-communism, and political activism laid the groundwork for what would become the dominant orientation of Korean conservative Protestantism in the second half of the 20th century. His influence extended to right-wing youth movements such as the Northwest Youth Association (서북청년단) and played a role in entrenching Christian anti-communism as a major force in national politics​.\n\nIn sum, Han Kyung-jik in the 1950s and 1960s was far more than a pastor—he was a nation-builder, a public theologian, and a moral leader. His thought and actions illustrate a uniquely Korean model of Christian political theology in which spiritual and national redemption were deeply intertwined. His legacy—though increasingly contested in recent years—continues to shape how many in the Korean Protestant community understand the relationship between church and nation.\n\n\n손양원 孫良源 Yang Won Son\n\n07/07/1902 ~ 09/28/1950\n\nSon Yang-won (1902–1950) was a prominent Christian martyr in Korea, whose life was marked by unwavering faith and sacrificial love. From the Japanese colonial period to the outbreak of the Korean War, he lived among the afflicted, especially those suffering from Hansen’s disease, embodying the gospel through every aspect of his life. His journey culminated in what has been called a \"life prepared for martyrdom.\" After Korea’s liberation in 1945, Son returned to the Aeyangwon leprosy sanatorium in Yeosu. For him, Aeyangwon was not merely a medical institution but a community of faith. He lived like family with more than a thousand residents, breaking down social barriers, shaking their hands, eating with them, entering the intensive care units, and even using his mouth to draw out pus from infected wounds when needed. Each day, he prayed, “Lord, help me truly love Aeyangwon,” asking to love them more than his own family. His ministry was not based on pity, but on the incarnational love of Christ made visible. During this time, he traveled throughout Korea to preach at revivals, emphasizing repentance, the return of Christ, and spiritual purity. His messages were not merely words—they were lived sermons. Many testified that they encountered God through his life as much as his preaching.\n\nIn 1948, the Yeosu-Suncheon Incident brought Son perhaps his greatest trial: the martyrdom of his two sons, Dong-in and Dong-shin, at the hands of leftist student rebels. In a shocking act of forgiveness, Son rescued the murderer, Kang Chul-min, from execution and adopted him as his son. At a time when the country was gripped by vengeance and political hatred, Son’s act of love and reconciliation demonstrated the gospel’s power to transcend ideology. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, many Christian leaders and missionaries fled south. But Son refused to leave his flock behind. Instead, he held a special service titled “Let Us Die Well,” where he declared, “First is martyrdom, second is martyrdom, and third is martyrdom. Be ready to die well.” He longed to become a sacrificial offering, saying, “If the Lord permits, I wish to become a sacrifice this time.” Despite numerous pleas for him to escape, Son eventually returned alone to Aeyangwon. On September 13, 1950, he was arrested by Communist forces. He willingly gave himself up to protect the leprosy patients, having heard that unless he surrendered, they would all be massacred. During his fifteen days of detention in the Yeosu Police Station, Son continued his ministry. He prayed every morning during re-education sessions, shared his meager meals with weaker prisoners, and insisted on taking punishment in place of others. He preached tirelessly in word and deed, even under extreme duress.\n\nOn September 28, 1950, while being transferred to Suncheon, he was executed in a peach orchard in Yeosu. According to witnesses, he encouraged his fellow prisoners to pray until the end and even preached to the guards escorting him. His mouth was crushed—reportedly because he kept proclaiming the name of Jesus until his final breath. Son’s death was not that of a mere anti-Communist. While some have labeled him a nationalist or anti-Communist martyr, such ideological interpretations fall short of the depth and integrity of his witness. His life and death were not politically motivated but were deeply rooted in the imitation of Christ. He forgave, loved, and reconciled across enemy lines. He detested ideological divisions and embraced anyone who sought to follow Christ sincerely, regardless of political affiliation. Son Yang-won was, as his children described, “addicted to Jesus.” His martyrdom was not an accident, but the natural outcome of a life wholly consecrated to Christ. As the “Atomic Bomb of Love,” he exploded the power of the gospel—love, forgiveness, and peace—into a society torn by hatred and war. Even today, his life continues to challenge and inspire those who ask what it truly means to live and die as a follower of Christ.\n\n\n김양선 목사  金良善Yang Seon Kim\n\n1907 ~ 10/11/1970\n\nIn the 1950s, Kim Yang-seon emerged as a practical intellectual who deeply reflected on the historical responsibility and mission of the Korean church amid the political and social turmoil following national liberation. In particular, he sought to critically examine how Christianity had functioned in post-liberation Korea and how the church could contribute to society and the nation. His 1956 publication, The Ten-Year History of Korean Christianity After Liberation (韓國基督敎解放十年史), is regarded as a work that best reveals his historical awareness. This book was the first to comprehensively document the movements and developments of Korean Christianity from 1945 to 1955 in a chronological and thematic structure. More importantly, it represented a pioneering effort to position Christianity within the broader context of national history.\n\nIn this work, Kim directly named individuals who had participated in the Japanese-imposed Shinto shrine worship and criticized the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church for its failure to take moral responsibility. He argued that the church must engage in self-reflection and repentance for its historical wrongdoings. This bold critique caused considerable backlash among conservative figures in the denomination, culminating in a 1958 resolution by the General Assembly to ban the publication of his book. However, the controversy sparked by this ban served as a critical turning point in Korean church history, marking one of the earliest calls for ethical reflection and historical responsibility from within the church.\n\nBeyond his critical writings, Kim was also an active educator and revivalist. He taught church history at the Central Theological Seminary for over a decade and worked as a teacher at Soongsil Middle School, where he instilled in students a sense of national and spiritual identity. At the same time, he committed himself to Sunday school education and nationwide revival campaigns. His activities—such as organizing fasting prayers, cooperative evangelism, and lay leadership training—demonstrated his conviction that the gospel must extend beyond individual salvation to serve as a transformative force for society.\n\nHis dedication to Christian education was recognized at the institutional level. In 1958, he received a commendation from the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church for his contributions to educational ministry. In the following year, he served as the director of Sunday school education under the General Assembly’s Department of Education and played a major role in organizing the 44th General Assembly. During this period, he worked to systematize Sunday school programs nationwide, develop educational materials, and train teachers, thereby laying the foundation for Christian education in postwar Korea.\n\nUltimately, the 1950s represent a period in which Kim Yang-seon simultaneously pursued historical insight and practical engagement. Through his writings, he advocated for ethical historiography in the church, while his educational and organizational efforts pointed to a vision of the church grounded in both truth-telling and future-building. For these reasons, he is remembered as a rare figure who combined historical critique with constructive leadership in Korean Christian history.\n\n\n김기창 金基昶 Ki-chang Kim\n\n02/18/1913 ~ 01/23/2001\n\nUnbo Kim Ki-chang (1914–2001) emerged as a pioneer of indigenized Christian art in Korea during the 1950s. Amid the social turmoil and spiritual devastation following the Korean War, Kim dedicated himself to translating the language of faith into visual form. His art became a channel for expressing the suffering, identity, and hope of the Korean people within the framework of the biblical narrative. The 1950s mark a critical turning point in his artistic journey, especially as seen in his magnum opus, The Life of Jesus, which exemplifies the confluence of Eastern and Western aesthetics, personal spiritual reflection, and a strong sense of national consciousness.\n\nThe Life of Jesus, a 30-painting series begun in 1952 and refined through the 1970s, presents the story of Jesus not in its original historical setting, but rather within the context of late Joseon Korea. In these paintings, Jesus appears as a Confucian scholar in traditional attire, and other biblical figures are similarly dressed as Koreans from the 18th or 19th centuries. This bold reimagining is not mere anachronism—it reflects Kim’s theological and artistic attempt to contextualize the Gospel within Korean history and culture. Through this localization, he sought not only to make Christianity more accessible to Koreans but also to offer comfort and hope to a war-torn people.\n\nKim employed traditional Eastern painting techniques, particularly ink-and-wash and elements of Korean folk painting (minhwa), while also preserving the compositional structure and narrative clarity often found in Western religious art. His portrayal of Jesus avoids overt emotionalism and instead relies on restrained lines, minimal color palettes, and meditative spatial balance, inviting deep contemplation. These stylistic choices echo Kim’s own personal story—having lost his hearing due to a childhood illness, he communicated and experienced the world largely through visual perception. Thus, his artistic vision reflects a search for “the language of silence,” and his work becomes a spiritual exercise in visual theology.\n\nThis visual reinterpretation of the Gospel coincided with the Korean people’s urgent need for a restored sense of identity in the aftermath of Japanese colonialism and the Korean War. By portraying Jesus as a figure resembling a Korean nobleman, Kim fused Christian values with Korean ideals of moral leadership and scholarly dignity. While the “yangban Jesus” might suggest social elitism, in Kim’s interpretation, it emphasizes wisdom, virtue, and spiritual authority. In this way, Kim’s art bridges the universality of the Christian message with the specificity of Korean cultural values.\n\nHis work earned him the nickname “Korea’s Rembrandt,” not simply due to artistic skill but because, like Rembrandt who painted Jesus with a Jewish face, Kim depicted Jesus with a Korean face. This move is profoundly theological as well as cultural—it asserts that the incarnation can be meaningfully expressed through every people’s history and visage. Rather than relying on European iconography, Kim reclaims the biblical story from a Korean visual standpoint. His restrained and introspective Jesus contrasts sharply with the dramatic, ornate figures common in Western religious painting, thus conveying a spirituality grounded in silence and suffering.\n\nInternationally, The Life of Jesus series drew attention in exhibitions and Christian art circles as a model of indigenous theology through visual art. Critics noted that Kim's reinterpretation of the Gospel was neither derivative nor exoticized, but a sincere and creative translation of Christian faith into Korean idioms. His work illustrates that Christian art need not imitate the West to be considered authentic; it can instead express the Gospel's truth in a culturally faithful manner. Through this project, Kim demonstrated that art could indeed preach the Gospel in a language beyond words.\n\nIn essence, Kim Ki-chang’s Christian art of the 1950s represents a remarkable integration of traditional Korean aesthetics, modern theology, and personal piety. The Life of Jesus is not merely a series of religious paintings but a profound expression of what it means to encounter the divine in the midst of historical suffering. Kim’s visual theology showed that Jesus’ life could be told as “our story”—the story of the Korean people. His artistic vision continues to resonate in Korean churches, seminaries, and art circles, offering a lasting model of how faith, culture, and creativity can come together in powerful harmony.381011156970\n\n\nAmong the paintings in The Life of Jesus series (https://www.catholictimes.org/article/200304200070438_\n\n\nWilliam Hamilton Shaw \n\n06/05/1922 ~ 09/22/1950\n\nWilliam Hamilton Shaw (Korean name: Seo Wi-ryeom) was born on June 5, 1922, in Pyongyang to American Methodist missionaries William Earl Shaw and Adeline Hamilton Shaw. His parents were key figures in the early Christian mission efforts in Korea, contributing to the establishment of seminaries and hospitals in Pyongyang. Raised in this missionary context, Shaw became fluent in Korean and deeply familiar with Korean life and culture. He graduated from Pyongyang Foreign School and later attended Ohio Wesleyan University in the United States. He eventually enrolled in the doctoral program in East Asian Studies at Harvard University. At the center of his life was always his Christian faith, which manifested itself in his love for others, his willingness to serve, and ultimately, in his self-sacrifice.\n\nDuring World War II, Shaw served as an officer in the United States Navy, participating in the European theater and taking part in the Normandy landings. After the war, from 1946 to 1947, he returned to Korea as an instructor at the Korea Maritime Police Academy in Jinhae (now the Republic of Korea Naval Academy), under the U.S. military government. There, he trained cadets not only in navigation and military tactics but also instilled in them a sense of responsibility and service. Many of his students later became foundational leaders of the South Korean Navy. His contribution was not merely technical; it represented a leadership style rooted in Christian ethics, providing a model of how faith-informed education could shape a newly emerging nation.\n\nWhen the Korean War broke out in 1950, Shaw was pursuing his doctoral studies at Harvard. He voluntarily withdrew from the program and reenlisted in the U.S. Navy. In a letter to his mother, he wrote, “Korea is my home. If the people are fighting for freedom and I am not there with them, I could not live with myself.” This was more than a personal sentiment; it reflected his Christian worldview, his moral conviction, and his understanding of historical responsibility. He identified himself not only as an American or a Korean but ultimately as a citizen of the Kingdom of God, choosing to stand with those who suffered. Thanks to his fluency in Korean and his knowledge of local geography, Shaw was appointed as an intelligence officer under General MacArthur’s command. He participated in the Incheon Landing Operation and soon joined the campaign to recapture Seoul. On September 22, 1950, while operating in the Nokbeon-dong area of Eunpyeong District, he was killed in action during an ambush by North Korean forces. At the time, Shaw was warning civilians to evacuate before an impending artillery strike. He died while attempting to save others, his final act embodying the Christian ideal of laying down one’s life for one’s friends—a form of martyrdom by any theological standard. The U.S. Navy posthumously awarded Shaw the Silver Star, and the South Korean government presented him with the Eulji Order of Military Merit in 1956 and the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit in 2019. Originally buried in Yokosuka, Japan, his remains were relocated to the Yanghwajin Foreign Missionary Cemetery in Seoul in accordance with his mother’s wishes. His gravestone is inscribed with John 15:13: “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” This verse encapsulates his life and faith—a model of a Christian who followed the path of Christ to the end.\n\nToday, Shaw is remembered as a symbol of the Korea–U.S. alliance, with statues erected at the Naval Academy and Peace Park in Eunpyeong, Seoul. However, his legacy should not be confined to military or diplomatic symbolism. Shaw was a missionary’s son who followed the gospel, a disciple of Christ who obeyed God’s calling and gave his life for others. His devotion represents a powerful testimony of how freedom, justice, and faith can be harmonized. His story raises a timeless question for Christians: “For whom, and by what faith, are you living your life today?” William Hamilton Shaw projected the values of the gospel throughout every aspect of his life. He did not regard “freedom” merely as a political concept, nor nation”as an expression of nationalism. His vision was grounded in the love and justice of the Kingdom of God, and for that cause, he willingly gave of himself. His life transcends the Korean War, offering an enduring model of Christian witness across cultures, nations, and generations.\n\n\nHarold Voelkel\n\n02/14/1898 ~ 1975\n\nOne of the most historically significant episodes in the postwar ministry of Harold Voelkel was his pivotal role in the release of anti-communist prisoners of war (POWs) in 1953. As a chaplain at the Geoje Island POW camp during the Korean War, Voelkel dedicated himself to nurturing spiritual freedom and hope through the Gospel among North Korean and Chinese POWs. He supported Christian prisoners who, under grave threat of forced repatriation to the North, wrote blood letters stating “We resolutely oppose repatriation,” which they wore on their foreheads as headbands. Voelkel, moved to tears by their faith and determination, personally delivered one of these blood letters to President Syngman Rhee, leveraging his shared alma mater, Princeton University, to bridge communication. This powerful gesture deeply impressed President Rhee, who was thereby convinced of the strong Christian and pro-democratic presence among the POWs. This event became the catalyst for Rhee’s bold decision to release over 27,000 anti-communist POWs, a move that not only challenged U.S. and UN policies at the time but also precipitated the signing of the Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty just prior to the ceasefire. Voelkel’s role transcended that of a humanitarian or religious figure; his work had tangible geopolitical consequences, shaping postwar diplomacy and national security policy. His commitment to faith-based support within the camps facilitated the creation of Christian communities that mirrored the early church—characterized by shared suffering, encouragement, and fervent prayer. Former POWs testified that they held worship services twice daily, evangelized among fellow prisoners, and experienced spiritual revival under Voelkel’s leadership. In an environment devoid of possessions or comfort, only faith and brotherhood remained.\n\nFollowing the war, Voelkel continued his support for the released Christian POWs. Many, such as Rev. Kim Chang-sik, received scholarships from Voelkel and pursued theological education. Kim would later graduate from Seoul Theological University, become an ordained minister, plant churches in both Korea and the United States, and serve as a professor in seminary education. Such stories illustrate how Voelkel’s postwar ministry extended beyond relief work to the development of Christian leadership in South Korea. His ministry was neither accidental nor merely reactive. Voelkel was part of a wider evangelical movement that aligned Christian values with anti-communist ideology and South Korea’s national identity. His mission reflected a strategic vision that integrated theology, politics, and humanitarian care. Through rebuilding churches, reestablishing seminaries, and fostering U.S.-Korean church relations, Voelkel helped establish the institutional and ideological foundations of modern Korean Protestantism. Voelkel’s postwar legacy continues to resonate not only in theological institutions and congregations but also in the ideological DNA of Korean Christianity—particularly its resistance to communism, alignment with democracy, and emphasis on education. His life serves as a vivid example of how faith, courage, and conviction can shape the destiny of both individuals and nations.\n\n\n함석헌 咸錫憲 Seok-heon Ham\n\n03/13/1901 ~ 02/04/1989In the 1950s, Ham Seok-heon played a pivotal role as a public intellectual and religious thinker in redefining the meaning of freedom and reorienting the role of religion in a rapidly transforming Korean society. This was a period marked by the Korean War, ideological polarization between communism and liberal democracy, and the entrenchment of Cold War politics on the Korean peninsula. Within this context, Ham refused to align himself with either the authoritarian South Korean regime or the hegemonic influence of U.S.-style anti-communism. Instead, he proposed a third way rooted in conscience, spirituality, and ethical responsibility.\n\nHam’s understanding of freedom diverged sharply from the dominant Christian right of the time, which had largely equated freedom with anti-communism and loyalty to Western democracy. For Ham, freedom was not just a political right or opposition to communism—it was an inner moral and spiritual awakening that led individuals to live ethically, to think independently, and to act courageously in the face of oppression. He wrote: “We are not free because we oppose communism or support democracy. We are only free when we recognize our moral duty and stand before God and history with a clean conscience.” His critique extended to the institutional church. He condemned what he saw as the moral collapse of Korean Christianity, which, in his view, had sold out to power and wealth, becoming complicit in the systems of oppression. In his influential 1956 essay, What Is Korean Christianity Doing?, published in Sasang-gye magazine, he asked sharply why the church remained silent amid political corruption, poverty, and suffering. This article not only triggered fierce debates within the Christian community but also signaled Ham’s emergence as a leading prophetic voice.\n\nIt was during this time that Ham began developing his concept of the “Ssi-al” (씨알)—literally \"seed grain,\" but symbolically referring to the common people as bearers of spiritual and historical agency. He believed that the Ssi-al represented the conscience of the nation, the hidden vitality of history, and the only true basis for a just society. This idea was revolutionary in a time when national identity was largely framed through elites, political ideologies, or military strength. Ham’s vision of freedom and the Ssi-al intersected in his critique of power. He saw both communism and capitalism as materialist ideologies that reduced the human being to a tool of production or control. In contrast, he advocated for a human-centered society rooted in spiritual dignity, moral struggle, and personal responsibility. He also increasingly distanced himself from doctrinaire Christian exclusivism. Although deeply shaped by Christianity, Ham began to express religious pluralism in the 1950s. He read Hindu texts, engaged with Buddhist ideas, and studied Taoist and Confucian thought. His move toward a post-denominational and transcultural spirituality marked a turning point in his intellectual journey and prepared the ground for his embrace of Quakerism in the following decade.\n\nFurthermore, the 1950s saw Ham acting not only as a theorist but also as a public educator. He delivered lectures and sermons across Korea, seeking to awaken what he called the “sleeping conscience of the people.” He held that democratic revolution was only possible when ordinary people began to think critically and act morally. For Ham, this required education, inner transformation, and ethical leadership—not military coups or foreign intervention. By the end of the 1950s, Ham Seok-heon had effectively laid the foundation for a Korean democratic spirituality—a fusion of prophetic religion, ethical philosophy, and participatory social vision. His ideas directly influenced the democratic uprisings of the 1960s and later shaped the theological foundations of Korea’s minjung (people’s) movement in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\n김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim\n\n09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987\n\nThe 1950s marked Kim Jae-jun’s transformation from theologian to ecclesiastical reformer and public intellectual. In the aftermath of liberation from Japanese colonial rule and amid the traumatic consequences of the Korean War, the Korean Protestant Church was largely dominated by neo-orthodox conservatism. Kim opposed what he viewed as an \"anti-historical and anti-cultural orthodoxy,\" calling instead for a theology that was historically responsible, nationally conscious, and morally engaged with society.\n\nAfter the liberation in 1945, Kim resumed his leadership of Chosun Theological Seminary, which he had co-founded in 1940. Unlike the newly established Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Namsan, led by Park Hyung-ryong, Chosun Seminary embraced liberal theology and welcomed the historical-critical approach to biblical interpretation. Kim's insistence on biblical fallibility (biblical errancy) and theological openness led to increasing tension with conservative factions within the Presbyterian General Assembly. The controversy culminated in 1947 during the 33rd General Assembly with the so-called \"Statement of 51\" incident, in which 51 delegates submitted a petition denouncing Kim’s theology. Despite the theological nature of the dispute, the conflict became mired in regionalism and power struggles between northern and southern church leaders. The situation escalated when the General Assembly approved a new seminary (the Presbyterian Seminary) under Park Hyung-ryong in 1949, resulting in two rival seminaries under the same denomination.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the conflict intensified. In May 1952, the 37th General Assembly revoked the status of both seminaries as official theological institutions and instead decided to establish a new seminary in Daegu. However, the resolution collapsed amid protests from Chosun Seminary supporters. The Assembly refrained from formally disciplining Kim, instead delegating the decision to his regional presbytery. The presbytery, however, refused to comply and issued a public statement rejecting the General Assembly's ruling as unconstitutional. This rebellion against ecclesiastical authority received tacit support from foreign missions, including the Canadian Presbyterian Mission and the American Southern Presbyterian Mission. In 1952, amid growing polarization, Kim resumed publication of The Crusader (Sipjagun), a theological and socio-political magazine. It became a platform for articulating not only religious liberty and theological openness but also critiques of authoritarianism, social inequality, and reactionary nationalism. The Crusader positioned itself at the intersection of faith, conscience, and historical responsibility. \n\nIn 1953, at the 38th General Assembly in Daegu, Kim Jae-jun was officially defrocked on the grounds that he continued to promote “biblical errancy.” In response, Kim and his supporters formally separated and founded the Korean Christian Church (Kijang) in 1954 at the newly established Korea Theological College in Dongja-dong, Seoul. This was not merely a denominational split but a symbolic declaration of the right to religious conscience and theological freedom in the face of conservative church orthodoxy. Kim’s rejection of both reactionary nationalism and Cold War anti-communism set him apart from both the mainstream church and the state. Instead, he emphasized a vision of freedom rooted not in Western liberal ideology per se, but in a theological anthropology that centered on the dignity of the individual conscience before God. The founding of Kijang therefore institutionalized a church that sought to be prophetic rather than popular, free rather than doctrinally controlled, and socially responsible rather than spiritually escapist.\n\nThese struggles in the 1950s would lay the foundation for Kim’s subsequent development of a participatory theology and his leading role in Korea’s religious-based democratization movement in the decades that followed.\n\n\nPaul Roh Ki-nam 盧基南 노기남\n\n01/22/1902 ~ 06/25/1984\n\nDuring the 1950s, Archbishop Nogi Nam stood as a central figure not only in the Korean Catholic Church but also in the broader context of modern Korean history. With the Korean War erupting in 1950, he actively interpreted the conflict not simply as a civil war, but as an ideological struggle between communism and liberal democracy. This interpretation shaped his call for the faithful to resist communism with the spirit of martyrdom, framing the war as a battle for religious freedom and national identity.\n\nArchbishop Nam took a hands-on approach in politics, forming close ties with the U.S. military government and the South Korean government. He helped select political candidates, recommended right-wing leaders to the U.S. military, and played a critical role in the post-liberation ideological alignment of South Korea. He also utilized the Catholic press—particularly the revival of Kyunghyang Magazine and Kyunghyang Newspaper—as tools to promote anti-communist ideology and support the establishment of a democratic government.\n\nFollowing the Korean War, the Catholic population in Korea surged from approximately 170,000 in 1953 to over 530,000 by 1962. This was not only due to war-related displacement and the search for spiritual comfort but also to the Church’s increasingly visible role in national affairs. Archbishop Nam led efforts to expand the Church's structure by elevating vicariates to dioceses and founding educational institutions, most notably Sogang University. Despite his contributions, he faced political backlash, particularly from President Rhee Syngman's regime. Tensions with Rhee escalated due to Nam's support for Jang Myeon and his government's opposition. This culminated in the forced closure of Kyunghyang Newspaper in 1959. Nevertheless, Nam’s influence endured through the early 1960s, especially during the Second Republic and even after the 1961 military coup led by Park Chung-hee.\n\nIn essence, Archbishop Nogi Nam’s leadership in the 1950s laid the foundation for the Catholic Church’s growth and public presence in Korea. His pragmatic approach to social participation shaped the Church as not only a spiritual community but also a moral and ideological force in Korea’s nation-building era.\n\n\nTable 2.

Born in 1913 in Sycamore, Illinois, to Swedish immigrant parents, Swanson experienced a religious conversion at the Queen Anne Baptist Church in Seattle in 1923. He later became a traveling revivalist and served as a Baptist pastor for over a decade in Washington and Chicago. In July 1950, he resigned from his church to pursue a global evangelistic calling, which led him to war-torn Korea during the Korean War.\n\nHis encounter with the tragedy of war orphans in Korea became a turning point in his ministry. After visiting Daegu in 1952 and witnessing orphaned children suffering from hunger and neglect, Swanson felt compelled to act. A local missionary challenged him, saying, “Swanson, you’ve seen the need and the opportunities here—what will you do about it?” That question haunted him throughout his return flight to the U.S., leading him to vow his support for Korean children. \n\nRather than building a conventional missionary organization, Swanson envisioned a method of direct support. In 1952, he sent $1,000 through a local missionary to purchase a house in Bukpyeong, Gangwon Province—this became the first orphanage he supported, named Shin Ae Won (House of New Love). Over the next few years, he established or funded numerous other orphanages, often converting missionaries’ homes or church properties into shelters. By 1961, the number of orphanages he supported had grown to 113, aiding over 4,500 children. \n\nA transformative moment in Swanson’s work came in 1954, when he introduced the innovative \"one-to-one sponsorship\" model. This allowed an American family to directly sponsor a Korean child, providing $4 monthly for food, clothing, education, and spiritual care. Swanson wrote in his diary that he realized supporting an orphanage was not enough—\"we must invest in the whole person\"—and thus began to focus on holistic child development. \n\nIn 1956, Swanson formalized his work by establishing the Everett Swanson Evangelistic Association (ESEA), headquartered in Chicago. The organization, later renamed Compassion in 1963, reflected its new mission of “releasing children from poverty in Jesus’ name.” Inspired by Matthew 15:32, the name Compassion emphasized empathy and active care rather than institutional charity alone. \n\nCompassion’s work extended far beyond orphanage construction. The organization offered:\n\nMedical aid, including shipment of $1 million in supplies annually and direct medical support from staff nurses. \n\nVocational education, with schools for boys (farming in Gimpo) and girls (sewing, crafts, and English typing at the Youngjin Center). \n\nHigher education scholarships and study abroad programs, especially through partnerships with American evangelical foundations. \n\nSupport for local pastors, particularly those in remote areas or special ministries, reflecting the belief that strengthening the Korean church was essential for community rebuilding. \n\nThe WARM (Winter Aid Relief Money) project, which provided long coats and winter clothing to help children participate in normal seasonal activities, such as skating and snow play. \n\nAdoption assistance, which included screening adoptive parents for spiritual maturity. Compassion emphasized that adoptive parents be “born-again Christians.” \n\nSwanson died in November 1965 after a short battle with a brain tumor. His wife Miriam and missionary Henry Harvey continued the leadership of Compassion, which by then had become one of the “big four” Christian relief agencies in Korea alongside World Vision, CCF, and OMS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n김용기 金容基Yong-ki Kim\n\n09/05/1909 ~ 08/01/1988\n\n\nElder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers’ School, which became more than a school — it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.\n\nKim's background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim’s lifelong compass: “The intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.” This wasn’t simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.\n\nKim’s household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one’s responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the \"Canaan community\" — a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.\n\nFrom this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers’ School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: diligence, service, and sacrifice. Labor, in Kim’s view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. \"Those who do not work shall not eat,\" he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.\n\nIn 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school’s influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea’s Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim’s core values — self-help, self-reliance, cooperation — were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school’s training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.\n\nFurthermore, Kim’s insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement’s community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki’s Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim's influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.\n\nUltimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki’s 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers’ School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‘city on a hill’ where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer’s hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.\n\n\n한경직 韓景職 Kyung-Chik Han\n\n12/29/1902 ~ 04/19/2000\n\n\nThe 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev. Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation’s humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.\n\n\nNationwide Evangelization Movement: \"Thirty Million to Christ\"\n\nIn 1965, Rev. Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of \"Evangelism in Depth\". Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.\n\nThe campaign’s slogan, “Thirty Million to Christ”, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han's radical vision to reshape Korea’s societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev. Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.\n\n\nGospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction\n\nHan’s vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, “Become a New Person, Build a New Nation”. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea’s rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley’s role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.\n\nHe envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.\n\n\nTable 1. 1960s Evangelism & North Korea-Related Ministry of Han Kyung-Jik\n\n| Year | Event | Summary |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1962 | Presbyterian Jubilee Sermon | Han declares the vision of national evangelism: “The gospel must reach all 30 million people.” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1964 | Evangelization roundtable | Han introduces the “Evangelism in Depth” strategy at a church leaders' meeting with Kim Hwal-lan. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1965 | Nationwide Evangelization Movement | Begins Korea’s first large-scale, interdenominational gospel campaign: “Thirty Million to Christ.” Emphasizes culture-wide evangelism using media. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1966 | Berlin World Evangelism Conference | Learns the “Golden Harvest” model, leading to focus on evangelism in the military and industrial sectors. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1967–1969 | Support for North Korea | Suggests humanitarian aid campaigns and frames them as gospel responsibilities. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970 | “Spiritual Revolution” Evangelistic Rally | Calls for national repentance, ethical reform, and spiritual rebirth under the slogan: “A New Person, A New Nation.” |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nNorth Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel\n\nAnother defining element of Rev. Han’s ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han’s approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action — advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.\n\n\n김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim\n\n09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987\n\n\nThe 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev. Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community’s progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.\n\nIn 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government’s normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan’s colonial rule, was in his eyes “an insult to history and a dishonest act before God.” He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, “Normalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.” Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the “National Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,” which resisted President Park’s unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, “Those who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people’s sovereignty but also God’s justice.” His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church’s sole mission is “saving souls,” which he called “a retreat from reality.” He stressed that “the church must declare God’s will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.” This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.\n\n\n장준하  張俊河 Chun-ha Chang\n\n08/27/1918 ~ 08/17/1975\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a “Christian martyr spirit.” During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called “Pastor Jang” by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.\n\nThese values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine Sasanggye (사상계), which Jang founded and edited. Sasanggye was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang’s spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, “We are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck... At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.” This statement reflects the gravity of Sasanggye’s role as more than a publication—it was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime’s oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, “Political freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.” Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.\n\nAt the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that “if the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.” He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.\n\nFor Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as Sasanggye was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a \"mouthpiece of the people,\" demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.\n\n\n함석헌 咸錫憲 Seok-heon Ham\n\n03/13/1901 ~ 02/04/1989\n\n\nThe 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of \"the people\" and \"Ssi’al\" at the center of his intellectual resistance.\n\nFor Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, “The people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham's theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.” This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham’s distinctive philosophy of Ssi’al. He stated, “He found Ssi’al-ness in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‘resistance’ was simultaneously the individual’s process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.” The Ssi’al are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth—seeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee’s administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, “Rather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.” This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ham's spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (mugyohoe) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, “For me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.” He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a “militant pacifist.” His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. “Although he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.” While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for “liberal democracy through the political subjectification of the Ssi’al.” Thus, Ham’s work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship—it was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the Ssi’al philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.\n\n\nGeorge Ogle\n\n01/27/1929 ~ 11/17/2020\n\n\nRev. George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers' rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that “the gospel cannot remain confined within church walls—it must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.”\n\nBeginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon’s poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job—gestures that gradually earned their trust. Influenced by the French \"Worker-Priest\" movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a “working clergy” program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers’ experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, “Don’t go there thinking you’re going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.”\n\nOgle’s mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers’ organization and political awareness, insisting that “democracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.” The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women’s labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle’s activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called “People’s Revolutionary Party Incident,” he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: “Rev. Ogle, farewell… Most of us know that you worked for our country’s true freedom and democracy… Your name will remain in history.”\n\nRev. George Ogle’s work was more than religious ministry—it was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.\n\n\n장기려 張起呂Gi-ryeo Jang\n\n10/05/1911 ~ 12/25/1995\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, Dr. Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea's medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: “to serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.” This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that “he would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor”—a vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.\n\nEntering the 1960s, Dr. Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the “Busan Meeting,” which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr. Jang recalled, “I had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.” This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.\n\nThe Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968—well before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name “Blue Cross” was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American “Blue Cross” system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well. The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr. Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that “love for one’s neighbor” could be understood as a form of “cooperative spirit.” This was not merely metaphorical—Christian theology shaped the Union’s policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.\n\nThe Blue Cross was also Korea’s first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea’s eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr. Jang’s work transcended hospital management—it became a model of faith-driven social reform.\n\nHis life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards—including the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize—he often humbly said, “I am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.” Dr. Jang’s activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a “good doctor,” but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.\n\n\n서병호 徐丙浩 Byeong-ho Seo\n\n07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972Seo Byung-ho (徐丙浩, 1885–1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School—founded by his father—and Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.\n\nDuring his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.\n\nThe Korean Red Cross, under Seo's leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.\n\nSeo once stated, \"Christ is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,\" emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization—under his guidance—emerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.\n\nAfter Korea’s liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.\n\nIn the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea’s political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement.\n\nSeo’s activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea’s modern history.\n\n\n박형규 朴炯圭Hyung-kyu Park\n\n08/25/1923 ~ 08/18/2018\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, Rev. Hyung-kyu Park’s activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.\n\nThe April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: “When I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.” He goes on to state, “I vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.”\n\nFollowing this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, “To achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.” From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of \"church democratization\" and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.\n\nThe anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity’s engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled “Our View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,” with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.\n\nIn 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee’s attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the “National Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,” he sharply criticized the regime in Christian Thought magazine, writing, “The Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.” He proclaimed, “The forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.” From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled “The Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,” he asserted that “the presence of Christians” meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless. In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan “Go to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,” the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of Christian Thought magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine’s focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.⁶\n\nIn the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul's shantytowns, supported by Park’s team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, “National modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.\n\nIn summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action—a church truly becoming the church in the world.\n\n\n조용기 趙鏞基David Yonggi Cho \n\n02/14/1936 ~ 09/14/2021\n\n\nThe ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea’s post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called “hope in the midst of despair.”\n\nCho’s ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God's urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, “The movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church’s journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.”\n\nDespite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea’s mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation. Yet Cho’s message had already gained widespread popularity. “He understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,” Park notes. Cho’s sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to “enjoy God’s blessings in the here and now,” giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences. His “Threefold Blessing” message—salvation, physical healing, and material prosperity—spoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.\n\nUnlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology. This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that “differences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.” Cho’s theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations—Presbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist—gathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as “a space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.”\n\nIt is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. “If Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,” Cho once wrote. Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a “gendered division of spiritual labor” in early Korean Pentecostalism.\n\nIn conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho’s ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be “evangelical” in Korea’s modern religious landscape.\n\n\n장면 張勉 John M. Chang\n\n\nJang Myeon (John Chang, 1899–1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang’s life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, “He was a ‘Catholic politician’ who sought to act according to Christian principles” even after entering political life.\n\nBefore his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College. Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was The Faith of Our Fathers, which he chose, as he put it, because “it became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.”\n\nThis background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea’s liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government’s advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that “the foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.” Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea’s first constitution and introduced a provision on “the sanctity and protection of marriage” to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women's rights. He later reflected, “This clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.”\n\nThe 1950s marked Jang’s rise on the international stage. As Korea’s first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, “After working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.”\n\nThis trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea’s newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as “an extension of faith and a service to the people,” spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy. However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a “former politician,” he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, “Politics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.”\n\nJang’s role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n한경직 韓景職 Kyung-Chik Han\n\n12/29/1902 ~ 04/19/2000\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Rev. Kyung-Chik Han’s activities extended beyond mere evangelism or church growth. He stood at the center of a nationwide evangelization movement that was deeply entangled with the national agenda. Alongside Hwal-lan Kim, Han launched the National Evangelization Movement in 1965, shifting the focus from church-based outreach to a nationwide strategy grounded in interdenominational unity. In 1973, he played a leading role in organizing the Billy Graham Crusade and the Centennial Mission Conference, symbolizing a unifying force based on moderate evangelical ecumenism. Han introduced the concept of Evangelism in Depth, emphasizing that “evangelistic witness must be complete, profound, and continuous,” and that it must “be embodied in daily life, aiming for a universal and cosmic impact.” This approach extended the church's mission beyond traditional preaching to a more embedded and transformative presence in everyday life, targeting national evangelization as a long-term goal.\n\nHan’s evangelistic movement was not limited to personal conversion but was closely linked with a vision for constructing a Christian-based national ethos. From the post-liberation period onward, Han proclaimed that “the basic spirit of Christianity—human dignity, freedom, and equality—must serve as the foundation for the newborn Republic of Korea.” He once preached, “If we launch a gospel movement with Christian ideals to reform the ideology of the Korean people, I am confident that a righteous, independent Christian Korea will be swiftly realized.” These convictions resonated with President Syngman Rhee’s liberal democratic philosophy and contributed to shaping the foundational ideology of the Republic. Han once stated, “The Republic of Korea must be built upon the spirit of Christianity, and the church must function as the nation’s spiritual leadership institution.”\n\nIn alignment with Cold War anti-communist ideology, Han led the “Total Military Evangelization Movement,” aimed at converting soldiers to Christianity, and received official support from the government and military authorities. This represented a practical form of evangelical nationalism during an era of close church-state relations. However, his industrial mission faced setbacks as it conflicted with labor rights and social justice issues. In 1983, Youngnak Church ultimately withdrew support for the industrial mission, illustrating the difficulty of reconciling Han’s moderate evangelicalism with the more radical demands of labor activism.\n\nIn sum, Han’s ministry in the 1970s evolved from an individual-focused evangelicalism to a comprehensive vision encompassing church unity, nation-building, and structural social transformation. His efforts represent an unprecedented fusion of religious and social engagement in the history of modern Korean Christianity.\n\n\n장준하 張俊河 Chun-ha Chang\n\n08/27/1918 ~ 08/17/1975\n\n\nThe 1970s were not merely a period of resistance against the Yushin regime for Jang Jun-ha—they were the culmination of his intellectual struggle and the stage for his martyrdom. Through the monthly journal Sasangge (Thought World), which he founded in 1953, he declared, “Our people must end the history of slavish submission and recover our own tradition and freedom,” embracing journalism as a moral mission to realize the public good. Sasangge was not merely a publication—it was a living forum of public discourse through which Jang shared his political philosophy, nationalism, and democratic ideals with the public. When Sasangge was forcibly shut down by the Park Chung-hee regime, Jang saw it not just as an act of censorship, but as an assault on critical intellectual space and liberal-nationalist discourse. He stated that it was “time to change our method of struggle against the perpetrators of May 16 [the 1961 coup],” and shifted fully into the realm of active politics. The closure of Sasangge represented not merely the silencing of a journal but the violent suppression of a free and ethical public sphere.\n\nAs a Christian, Jang Jun-ha integrated his faith with his political ethics. While studying at a theological seminary in Tokyo, he was conscripted into the Japanese army as a student soldier. However, unable to endure the humiliation and racial discrimination, he defected and joined the Korean Liberation Army. His decision was rooted not only in nationalism but also in a spiritual conscience. “My life only has value from this moment onward,” he resolved, equating martyr-like faith with national awakening. To him, the idea that “a Christian cannot remain silent in the face of falsehood and oppression” was not a metaphor—it was a conviction. Throughout his writings and speeches, the themes of “conscience” and “justice” repeatedly appear, grounded in theological vision. He declared, “If the life of the nation is cut off, then my own life has no meaning. A self that exists apart from a suffering people is no longer truly a self.” In this way, he understood the realization of the self as a spiritual act of communal solidarity—one could not stand before God without standing with the people. Christian faith, for Jang, was the basis for a public calling. He believed “the press is the weapon of civil rights, and its mission is like that of salt and light,” seeing journalism not simply as reporting, but as prophetic testimony. His resistance to the Yushin regime in the 1970s was not merely political rationalism—it was a moral imperative, born of a Christian commitment to truth and righteousness. In this regard, he is remembered not only as a nationalist but as a prophetic intellectual rooted in the Christian theology of justice.\n\nEven in his final years, Jang maintained strong ties to Christian communities. After his death in 1975 under suspicious circumstances at Yaksa Peak in Pocheon, many in the Korean Protestant world mourned him as “a modern-day Amos.” His death was not viewed as a political incident alone, but as a form of martyrdom—an embodiment of Christian conscience and sacrificial spirit.\n\n\n김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim\n\n09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987\n\n\nKim Jae-jun emerged in the 1970s as a symbol of Christian resistance grounded in liberal theology amidst the oppressive Yushin regime in South Korea. From the anti-third-term amendment movement in 1969 to his role as a representative of the National Council for the Protection of Democracy in 1971 and his outspoken opposition to the 1972 Yushin Constitution, Kim persistently confronted dictatorship. His actions drew increasing scrutiny from the state, leading to prolonged house arrest and surveillance. In March 1974, at the age of 74, he departed for Toronto, Canada, under the pretense of a brief stay. However, this departure effectively became a decade-long political exile. As he later recalled, he initially intended to stay abroad “only for two to three months,” but circumstances forced him into a prolonged absence from his homeland.\n\nHis exile was not an escape but a strategic relocation that opened a new front in the democratization struggle through international solidarity. Shortly after his arrival in Canada, Kim joined the Washington-based Korean Congress for Democracy and Unification (Hanmin-tong), an overseas organization that championed Kim Dae-jung’s “Democracy First, Unification Later” policy. Kim offered theological and moral legitimacy to the organization’s mission. He argued, “Justice without freedom undermines the essence of humanity,” affirming that political liberty was an extension of his theological convictions. His involvement symbolized a powerful convergence between liberal Christianity and democratic political ideals and served to strengthen the international network supporting Korea’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nKim’s political vision shifted in the 1970s from Cold War anti-communism to a human-centered historical consciousness. As a North Korean refugee and staunch anti-communist, he initially resonated with conservative nationalist views. However, he came to believe that “the suffering of the Korean people cannot be confined within the dichotomy of regime confrontation.” This realization led him to reframe the unification issue not merely as a geopolitical struggle but as a question of human rights and social justice. In line with Kim Dae-jung’s three-stage unification proposal, Kim emphasized that democracy and human dignity must precede any political reunification.\n\nThough Kim did not explicitly label himself a proponent of Minjung theology, his theology of participation laid the groundwork for it. He was deeply critical of the escapist tendencies of Korean Christianity, famously stating, “The slogan ‘Believe in Jesus and go to heaven’ ultimately promotes indifference to social reality or even encourages retreat from it”. He emphasized that the church must act as “salt and leaven” in society and that theology must be lived through the pursuit of justice, freedom, and human dignity. “The church,” he wrote, “must declare God's will by engaging in political critique, participation, action, supporting the best possible political models, and raising consciousness among clergy, laity, and those outside the church alike”. From this theological foundation, Kim advanced the concept of “theology of humanization,” in which the preservation of human freedom and dignity supersedes all political systems. His liberalism was not merely an importation of Western democratic ideals but a contextual theological response to Korea’s divided and repressive realities. His declaration that “the state has no reason to exist unless it guarantees human freedom and welfare” reflects his unwavering resistance to totalitarian rule.\n\nKim Jae-jun’s activities in the 1970s were not merely anti-Yushin protests but a holistic engagement that wove together theology and politics, domestic and global alliances, resistance and participation. He simultaneously pursued church reform and societal democratization, anchoring his work in a theological commitment to human liberation, national reconciliation, and moral responsibility. His life exemplified how Christian theology could be a driving force in the fight for justice and democracy.\n\n\n문익환 文益煥 Ik-hwan Moon\n\n06/01/1918 ~ 01/18/1994\n\n\nMoon Ik-hwan's life was theology itself, and his theology was the language of participation and obedience to the suffering people of his time. He was remembered as “a man who stormed against unjust power like a hurricane, yet approached bare-handed workers and the socially marginalized with the gentleness of a lamb,” and someone who “carried a more delicate and humble sensibility than a sprig of baby’s breath in his heart” as a pastor and spiritual leader. These seemingly contradictory qualities were not disjointed but rather a dialectical fruit of his lived theology.\n\nHis theological praxis took public form when he became the chair of the joint translation committee for the Old and New Testaments of the Bible under the Korean Bible Society in 1968. He did not view this as an academic task but as a transformative spiritual experience, stating that it was like “witnessing the collapse of three Jericho walls: the wall between Protestants and Catholics, the wall of theological prejudice, and the wall between Hebrew and Korean ways of thinking.” He resigned from his professorship and pastoral post to devote himself fully to this mission, and in the process, began writing poetry. He once confessed, “I did not start writing poetry to be judged as a poet but to discover myself. I sensed that this poetic activity might mark a turning point in my theological thinking.” His poetry carried the rhythm of the Hebrew Psalms and gradually evolved into a prophetic language of consolation and awakening for the Korean people. As one article noted, Moon was \"the one who planted the language of the Bible into the Korean Peninsula,\" making the Word of God accessible through the Korean language.In his translation, for instance, the Hebrew term shalom was not merely rendered as “peace,” but as a comprehensive reality of justice, completeness, life, and communion.\n\nA turning point in his public engagement came in 1975 with the suspicious death of Jang Jun-ha, a fellow democracy activist. “At the very moment of his burial,” Moon later recalled, “I vowed to live out his life in his place.” This resolution led to the drafting and public reading of the March 1st Declaration for National Salvation in 1976. But this transition did not emerge from a vacuum; he had already been involved in workers’ advocacy after the 1970 self-immolation of laborer Jeon Tae-il. He frequently visited the Cheonggye union to support and console workers. Jeon’s mother, Lee So-seon, remembered Moon as “a father figure who protected us with his entire being.”\n\nMoon radically reimagined the church. In a sermon, he declared, “The church is not a place that drugs people with religion and quietly sends them off to the next world—it must be a place that brings people to life.” He added, “We don’t need dead Christians who only whimper their way into heaven; we need churches overflowing with creative believers whose eyes shine with moral power, like a living, breathing body.” At the core of his theology was a structural integration of love, justice, peace, and life. “Justice,” he wrote, “is love erupting in anger. It is the social expression of love. Biblical peace is not mere calm but the fullness of life. Perfection, as Christ commanded, is perfection in love.” Peace (shalom), therefore, was not merely an eschatological hope but a historical mandate grounded in solidarity and resistance.\n\nUnification for Moon was not a political option but a theological imperative. He recalled his father’s words: “My father used to mutter even on his deathbed, ‘For our nation to be unified, the church must be united first.’” For Moon, nationalism was never to be confused with state ideology but understood as a “people-centered nationalism.” He believed “the common people, unlike those with vested interests, are naturally peace-oriented because they have nothing to defend with war.” His final major work, A History of the Hebrew People, was a theological and poetic retelling of the Bible from the perspective of the oppressed, connecting the exodus of the Hebrews with the aspirations of the Korean people. It has been evaluated as “a theological testimony of the feet that walked the path of liberation,” and a cornerstone of Korean Minjung theology.\n\n\n장기려 張起呂Gi-ryeo Jang\n\n10/05/1911 ~ 12/25/1995\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dr. Chang Kee-Ryo stood at the intersection of medicine, faith, and social justice. As a surgeon, educator, and Christian, he pioneered liver disease treatment in Korea and laid the groundwork for equitable health coverage through the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative. His holistic approach to healthcare—anchored in Christian ethics and civic responsibility—defined a new model of medical professionalism in postwar Korea.\n\nDr. Chang was the first in Korea to perform successful liver resections for liver cancer, initially in 1943, and later a large-volume hepatectomy in 1959. These groundbreaking procedures were not only clinical milestones but also reflections of his deep-seated belief in the healing ministry of medicine. As one colleague testified, “Dr. Chang believed that the body is governed by natural laws and that disease was a deviation from physiological order… this belief enabled him to succeed in what was then considered an impossible liver surgery”. In 1974, he founded the Korean Liver Research Association and served as its first president, institutionalizing his commitment to advancing hepatic medicine. However, Dr. Chang's work extended beyond operating rooms and laboratories. His founding of the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative in 1968 was a pivotal moment in Korea’s social welfare history. This nonprofit health insurance model was built on egalitarian principles: monthly premiums were flat regardless of age or health status, and no one was excluded from enrollment. At a time when the national health insurance law (1963) was still nominal and unenforceable due to lack of government funding, Dr. Chang’s initiative filled a critical gap. The Cooperative was deeply rooted in Christian values. Weekly Bible studies, known as the “Busan Meeting,” provided the intellectual and spiritual foundation for the insurance scheme. Dr. Chang described Christian love as “a spirit of cooperation” and sought to embody this in the Cooperative’s operations. He viewed healing not only as a clinical act but as an expression of divine compassion, once writing, “I believe the essence of medical practice lies in identifying with the suffering of the patient as if I were the patient myself”.\n\nEven more striking was his personal lifestyle: he refused to own property, lived in a small hospital dormitory after retirement, and once quietly opened a back door to let a patient without money “escape” hospital billing. When the national health insurance program began in 1989, Dr. Chang voluntarily dissolved the Cooperative and handed over its resources to the state—a gesture that epitomized his commitment to public good over institutional survival. Dr. Chang's professionalism extended into his teaching. He inspired generations of students with an almost ascetic devotion to truth and precision. One of his most famous declarations was: “A physician who does not leave behind written reflections on both success and failure is no more than a parasite among his peers”. Despite physical decline after a stroke, he continued correcting errors in his publications from his hospital bed.\n\nTo understand his legacy fully, one must see that Dr. Chang practiced medicine not as a commercial contract but as a sacred calling. He once declared, “From the day I became a doctor, I have never forgotten my promise to care for patients who cannot afford treatment. This is the yardstick by which I measure whether my life has been a success or a failure”.\n\n\n서남동 徐南同 Nam-dong Seo\n\n07/05/118 ~ 07/19/1984\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Reverend Seo Nam-dong emerged as a leading intellectual and practitioner who reshaped the landscape of Korean Christian theology. At the center of the Korean Association of Christian Professors (KACP), Seo played a pivotal role in articulating the theological foundations of ecumenical development theology and was instrumental in laying the groundwork for minjung theology—a theology rooted in the lived experiences and struggles of the oppressed.\n\nIn 1971, during the 9th KACP Annual Conference, Seo presented a seminal paper titled “The Humanization of Modern Science and Technology,” where he critically examined how technological advancement contributed to the alienation of human beings. He proposed that the path to humanization in the era of scientific and technological development lay in achieving balance and resonance between “technology and humanity, ideas and material, intuition and labor”. This reflects Seo’s effort to forge a theological response not just to spiritual questions but to the socio-material conditions of modern industrial life.\n\nThe Korean Association of Christian Professors, inspired by the World Council of Churches (WCC), developed the concept of the “Theology of Humanization” in line with global ecumenical missions. It sought to counteract the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and urbanization by restoring human dignity and agency. As a central leader and organizer of KACP, Seo contributed significantly to framing modernization not as a purely material project, but as a process rooted in human desire for liberation from poverty and oppression. He stated that modernization stemmed from “a fundamental longing for the liberation of human autonomy and creativity”.\n\nSeo's influence extended internationally. In 1973, although initially denied a travel visa, he was listed as a participant in several ecumenical conferences abroad and later preached the closing sermon at the joint Korea-Japan Christian Professors' Conference. His role in KACP was not only theological but also deeply political. In 1975, under Emergency Measure No. 9, he was forced into early retirement from Yonsei University. This act of political repression exemplified the state's crackdown on Christian intellectuals, including KACP's presidents, general secretaries, and leading thinkers.\n\nSeo Nam-dong’s theology was especially attentive to the concept of han—the deep sorrow and resentment of the oppressed in Korean cultural consciousness. He argued that theology must begin by responding to the wailing of the minjung (the people) and the groans of women. For Seo, the voices of the suffering were not just subjects of compassion but the very manifestation of God’s presence. As one article put it, “He heard the voice of God in their tears”. Hence, his radical declaration that “the minjung is Christ” underscored a profound theological shift: God is present not in the powers of the church or state, but in the depths of the people’s pain and struggle. Rather than confining his work to church reform, Seo advanced a liberative theology that confronted the structural violence of the South Korean state. He became known as a priest of han, embodying the pain and resistance of the oppressed. His theology was not abstract theorizing but a lived response to the urgent question, “Whose voice does theology listen to?” As one scholar observed, “Seo Nam-dong’s entire life was theology itself, and his theology was a cry for life and liberation”.\n\nIn conclusion, Seo Nam-dong was not only a theologian but also a prophetic public intellectual whose work shaped the Korean democratization movement and ecumenical theology of the 1970s. His thought continues to resonate today, urging theologians and Christians alike to engage with the cries of the marginalized and the demands of justice.\n\n\n지학순  池學淳  Daniel Ji Hak-soon\n\n09/09/1921 ~ 03/12/1993\n\n\nBishop Ji Hak-sun’s defiance of authoritarian rule in 1970s South Korea was not only an act of political courage but a theological embodiment of the Church’s mission to stand with the oppressed. His resistance emerged from the crossroads of global Catholic reform and Korea’s escalating dictatorship, culminating in a life that blurred the boundary between priesthood and prophetic activism.\n\nHaving studied canon law in Rome and ordained as bishop of the newly established Diocese of Wonju in 1965, Ji returned to Korea deeply influenced by the Second Vatican Council, which called the Church to recognize the “joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties” of all people, especially the poor and afflicted, as its own concerns. He later declared, “Priests must concretely practice the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social teachings of Popes John XXIII and Paul VI”. For Ji, these were not abstract exhortations but marching orders.\n\nHis pastoral leadership quickly collided with the growing repression of the Park Chung-hee regime. South Korea’s rapid industrialization, managed through crony capitalism and military control, led to deepening inequality, rural impoverishment, and urban labor exploitation. The people under Ji’s pastoral care—including coal miners, poor farmers, and factory workers—were among the most vulnerable. In this context, Ji came to see his role not merely as shepherd of souls, but as a defender of their dignity and survival. The moment of radical transformation came in 1970, when Ji confronted corruption in the establishment of Wonju MBC, a regional broadcasting station. Despite holding a minority share, his diocese faced stonewalling and disregard from the majority owner, the 5.16 Scholarship Foundation—a regime-aligned entity. Ji later reflected: “If a bishop is treated like this, what hope is there for ordinary people?”. This realization marked his shift from moral concern to civic resistance. Ji responded by organizing street marches and public protests to denounce institutionalized corruption, launching the Church into open confrontation with the state. This marked the first time a sitting bishop had taken such direct action against state authority in modern Korean history. The Park regime labeled his actions subversive, linking him to communist sympathizers merely because he advocated for human rights and defended figures like Kim Ji-ha, a poet and activist affiliated with Ji’s diocese.\n\nThe confrontation reached its apex in March 1974, when Ji signed the “3.1 Declaration for National Salvation,” a multi-faith statement condemning the Yushin Constitution and demanding democratic reforms. His participation was unprecedented: “I could no longer remain silent,” Ji explained later, describing his act as a “conscience declaration” in line with his priestly calling. This led to his arrest by the Korean CIA, imprisonment, and military trial. The Vatican expressed concern, and even U.S. diplomatic records show that his detention alarmed foreign observers, with one official warning that “a trial of a high-ranking clergyman would backfire internationally”. Yet Ji’s imprisonment ignited a powerful movement. His arrest became the catalyst for the formation of the Catholic Priests' Association for Justice, signaling a historic shift in the Korean Catholic Church’s posture—from cautious neutrality to prophetic engagement. As one scholar noted, “Ji’s suffering awakened the conscience of the Korean Church, showing that faith without justice was empty”.\n\nTheologically, Ji’s activism was grounded in what he called a “Christ-centered principle.” He viewed his ministry as a continuation of Christ’s suffering love for the world. “Like Christ carrying the cross, I too am resolved to suffer,” he wrote in his episcopal motto. His social engagement, including support for cooperatives, flood victims, and political prisoners, was an extension of this conviction that the Church must serve as “a sacrament of Christ in the world”.\n\nBishop Ji’s legacy in the 1970s lies not only in his personal resistance but in his transformation of the Korean Catholic Church into a voice of conscience in public life. By refusing to separate faith from justice, he redefined what it meant to be a bishop—not an administrator of rituals, but a witness to truth in the face of tyranny.\n\n\n김지하 金芝河 Ji-ha Kim\n\n02/04/1941 ~ 05/08/2022\n\n\nKim Ji-ha was not merely a poet in the 1970s, but a prophetic voice who confronted dictatorship with literature, faith, and philosophy. His works traversed the realms of literature, religion, and politics, giving expression to the suffering and resistance of the Korean people while shaping new theological and ecological discourse.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Kim Ji-ha made a powerful intervention into public discourse through his satirical poem Ojeok (The Five Bandits), a direct attack on the corruption of the Park Chung-hee regime. “After being imprisoned for his opposition to the 1964 Korea-Japan Treaty, Kim began articulating the suffering of the people through poetry”. His works were politically charged enough to provoke state suppression. For instance, his 1972 poem Bieo (Rumors), published in the Catholic monthly Creation, was immediately censored by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. The magazine was forced to shut down, and its editor and publisher had to resign.\n\nYet Kim's thought evolved through prison confinement, culminating in a spiritual awakening that redefined his philosophical trajectory. While incarcerated, he encountered The Phenomenon of Man by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a reading that proved transformative. He later recalled, “From that day, I realized I was no longer merely a believer of Cheondoism, but was returning to the original Donghak (Eastern Learning) of my ancestors”. This realization, which he called “a lopsided balance,” became the foundation for his new cosmic vision of life, which sought to integrate Eastern spirituality and Western evolutionary theology.\n\nKim did not see his newfound life philosophy as a retreat from politics. Rather, he framed it as a radical reinterpretation of the people’s struggle. He argued that “‘life,’ ‘ecology,’ and ‘the people’ are not separate concepts but interchangeable terms within the same discursive lineage”. In his poem Museun (What), he writes, “Thinking and thinking, and blocked in thought, I suddenly realized my life isn’t simple,” describing the universe not as distant but alive and teeming within him. Through this “biospiritual” poetics, he pushed beyond anthropocentrism and embraced a universal communion of beings. This transition influenced not only literature but also Korean theology. Kim Ji-ha’s poetry provided vital inspiration to theologian Suh Nam-dong, a founding figure of Korean minjung theology. “Suh Nam-dong even referred to Kim as a minjung theologian,” recognizing the deep theological significance of his literary imagination. Suh, who introduced Teilhard’s theology and the concept of Christian biopolitics to Korea, found in Kim’s life-centered poetry a theological language for liberation.\n\nMeanwhile, Kim was also deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching. Under the guidance of Chang Il-soon and Bishop Ji Hak-soon in the Diocese of Wonju, he studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and several papal encyclicals. “Kim Ji-ha recalled studying encyclicals and council documents while staying at Chang Il-soon’s home in 1970–71”. His play The Crowned Jesus embodies this synthesis: in a key scene, a nun rebukes a priest’s political apathy by invoking Catholic teachings—“Mother and Teacher, Peace on Earth, all the decisions of the Council, the words of the Pope, and the bishops’ calls for social justice”—in what is essentially Kim’s own voice speaking through her⁷. What makes The Crowned Jesus especially striking is that Kim’s critique did not merely rely on doctrine but reimagined the mutual agency of Jesus and the oppressed. In one scene, Jesus tells a leper: “You must liberate me. Only you can. Your poverty, wisdom, and courage against injustice are what free me. You have opened my mouth”. This reciprocal soteriology, in which the oppressed also save the Savior, reflects Kim’s theological innovation grounded in the Korean context.\n\nKim Ji-ha’s 1970s journey was thus not only literary and political but also theological and cosmological. His fusion of Catholic teaching, Donghak, Teilhardian evolution, and minjung consciousness rendered him not just a protest poet but a radical thinker seeking new foundations for humanity, justice, and creation itself.\n\n\n이우정 李愚貞 Woo-jung Lee\n\n08/01/1923 ~ 05/30/2002\n\n\nLee Woo-jung (1923–2002) was a leading Christian women’s rights activist in 1970s Korea, who bridged faith and action to address gender inequality, dictatorship, and systemic injustice. Her life and work exemplified a deeply theological commitment to human dignity, rooted in personal experience, Christian ethics, and resistance to the patriarchal and authoritarian structures of her time.\n\nBorn in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Lee was raised in a household shaped by contrasting influences: her grandfather Lee Hae-jo was a progressive educator who emphasized modern learning, while her father adhered strictly to Confucian values. Her early experiences of gender discrimination—such as being denied educational opportunities afforded to her brother—awakened her sensitivity to injustice. As a high school student, she even attempted to run away from home to avoid being conscripted into the Japanese military sexual slavery system. Eventually, her encounter with Christianity at a “Religion Church” in Seoul and her studies at Chosun Theological Seminary brought her into the orbit of influential figures like Kim Jae-jun and Moon Ik-hwan. Kim, in particular, emphasized the theological view that “in God there is no male or female,” affirming Lee’s dignity and instilling confidence in her.\n\nIn the 1970s, Lee emerged as a key figure in the Christian women’s movement. As president of the newly established Korean Church Women United (KCWU), she led efforts to confront state-condoned sex tourism targeting Japanese male visitors to Korea. Outraged by the exploitation of Korean women for foreign exchange, she declared: “We grieve over the reality that our daughters are being defiled under the excuse of earning foreign currency. We must protect our daughters”. She famously challenged the government by stating, “If prostitutes are the vanguard of earning foreign currency, then offer up your own daughters first”. Her leadership was instrumental in organizing education programs for women, lobbying government officials, and forming solidarity networks with Japanese and international women’s groups.\n\nLee’s feminism was grounded in a Christian anthropology of human dignity. She believed that women’s liberation was not simply about equal rights but about recovering their full humanity. “Women are oppressed in the family and workplace from a perspective that fundamentally denies their equal personhood,” she wrote, identifying sexism as a deeply embedded cultural structure. This philosophy undergirded her involvement in the 1976 March 1st Declaration for National Salvation, where she joined religious and political leaders in publicly denouncing President Park Chung-hee’s authoritarian regime. During her trial, she stated, “I participated out of a desire to defend freedom of religion and to call attention to injustice,” and declared, “I hope our society becomes one where people are treated as human beings”.\n\nHer political awakening was deepened by the death of labor activist Jeon Tae-il in 1970, which she described as “a moment that burdened my heart with a sense of debt to the workers, especially women workers”. Rather than turning away, she moved toward the suffering, engaging in labor rights advocacy, urban poor movements, and anti-torture campaigns throughout the decade. Lee later became a pioneer in Korean feminist theology. She advocated for a re-reading of Scripture through women’s eyes and criticized male-dominated theological frameworks. “True minjung theology must include the issue of women,” she emphasized, calling for a theology where women could participate freely in God’s salvific work. Her theological work was not merely academic but connected to grassroots activism, including support for unjustly fired female workers and campaigns for the rights of comfort women, factory workers, and displaced residents.\n\nLee Woo-jung’s legacy is a testament to a faith that walks alongside the oppressed and insists on their full humanity. She refused to separate theological reflection from lived reality, declaring through word and deed that “a single human being is more precious than the entire universe.”\n\n\n계의돈 Robert L. Goette\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dr. Robert L. Goette (Korean name: Gye Eui-don) emerged as a pivotal figure in evangelical higher education missions in Korea. As a lay educational missionary sent by the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), he realized an integrated model of mission that combined scientific education and gospel proclamation, primarily through his work at Hannam University. The 1970s marked a turning point in his ministry, as he transformed from a chemistry professor into a born-again evangelist committed to campus evangelization.\n\nHis spiritual renewal took place during a sabbatical in the United States in 1970, when he attended a Leadership Training Course (LTC) led by Dr. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC). There, he heard the verse, “For by grace you have been saved through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8–9). He confessed that this led him to repent of his misguided belief that salvation could be earned through good deeds, and he received assurance of salvation. From that point forward, he declared, “Teaching chemistry alone cannot transform people—only the Word of God can truly change lives.”\n\nUpon returning to Korea in 1971, his ministry focus shifted entirely. Goette regarded everyone—students, faculty, and alumni—as targets of evangelism, and prioritized personal evangelism and discipleship over programs or events. “His ministry focused not on events or programs, but on the salvation of individual souls,” noted a colleague. Inspired by 2 Timothy 2:2, he practiced spiritual multiplication by training faithful students who would, in turn, share the gospel with others.\n\nOne of his most distinctive contributions in the 1970s was institutionalizing creation science education. Beginning in 1976, he pioneered Korea’s first accredited university course on the topic, titled Bible and Science. At a time when Korean society was heavily influenced by scientific materialism and evolution, he taught that “many Koreans rejected the Bible because they had been falsely taught that evolution was factual and the Bible was wrong.” During a sabbatical, he collected educational materials—including films, books, and audio tapes—from the U.S. and translated them into Korean. He also wrote the Korean preface for the translated edition of Scientific Creationism by Henry Morris. Goette’s creation science class became foundational to the development of Christian worldview studies at Hannam University and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) in 1981. His course eventually enrolled close to 10,000 students and was adopted by other universities throughout Korea.\n\nHis evangelism extended beyond the classroom. In 1973, he opened a Christian Book Service Center on campus, providing free or low-cost access to Bibles and Christian literature in both English and Korean. He also practiced an ecumenical, holistic model of mission that integrated gospel witness with social responsibility. For example, he paid for surgery for a disabled female student and supported a hit-and-run victim’s recovery by giving him work as a groundskeeper and paying him a dignified salary.\n\nDr. Goette’s 1970s ministry exemplified a holistic, Christ-centered witness that combined intellectual rigor with personal piety and compassionate service. His legacy extends far beyond Hannam University’s chemistry department; it represents a model of evangelical mission that transformed lives, institutions, and ultimately, the trajectory of Christian higher education in Korea.\n\n\n김수환 추기경 金壽煥 Stephen Kim Sou-hwan\n\n07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009\n\n\nCardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan was a pivotal figure in redefining the Catholic Church’s role in Korean society during the turbulent 1970s. Drawing on the reformist spirit of the Second Vatican Council, he led the Korean Catholic Church toward becoming a “Church in the world,” grounded in justice and human dignity. Even under the authoritarian regime of President Park Chung Hee, he never relinquished the Church’s commitment to truth and compassion. When Bishop Ji Hak-sun was arrested in connection with the Mincheonghakryeon (National Democratic Youth and Student Federation) case in 1974, Cardinal Kim took the extraordinary step of directly meeting President Park to request Ji’s release. As one scholar notes, “Cardinal Kim made it clear that the Church could no longer remain silent,” and the incident marked a critical turning point in the Church’s engagement with social and political issues.\n\nCardinal Kim’s social involvement stemmed not from political ambition but from theological conviction. He declared, “Now the Church must give everything to serve society and become a Church in the world,” making it clear that faith must engage the public sphere. Under his leadership, Myeongdong Cathedral became not only a space of worship but also a symbol of democracy. He welcomed interreligious dialogue, inviting leaders of Buddhism, Protestantism, and other traditions to build peace and unity. Responding to a rapidly changing society, he emphasized, “Society demands that we bear witness to the Christ you profess by the way you live.” Cardinal Kim’s leadership stood out most clearly in his cautious but firm stance toward the Park regime. He did not openly attack the Yushin Constitution, yet he questioned the legitimacy of a system that trampled on human rights and dignity. When Bishop Ji was re-arrested after his \"Declaration of Conscience,\" Cardinal Kim avoided inflammatory rhetoric but articulated the Church’s position through quiet yet clear statements. His prudence allowed him to serve as a mediator between the radical priests of the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice and the institutional Church, preventing fragmentation while maintaining the Church’s moral credibility.\n\nAt a time when Korea was racing toward industrial development, Cardinal Kim raised urgent concerns about the cost of progress. As early as the 1970s, he stated, “Today’s society is clearly unhealthy. It is filled with spiritual and material pollution,” warning that Korea’s drive for modernization was eroding human dignity. “In the midst of material growth, humanity is deteriorating,” he argued, pointing to a system where spiritual poverty prevailed despite economic expansion. His critique was not merely economic or political—it was deeply ecological and theological. He saw the suffering of farmers, workers, and the urban poor as a sign of a deeper crisis: the loss of humanity and harmony with creation.\n\nCardinal Kim skillfully avoided politicizing religion while consistently affirming the Church’s moral responsibility. He believed that “religion should not be a place of escape from the world, but a source of hope for the world,” and his actions proved this belief. He upheld the view that the Church must stand with the people, not with power. While he rarely clashed directly with the Park regime, he used the moral authority of the Church to push for justice and human rights. His leadership not only reformed the Church in the 1970s but laid the ethical groundwork for Korea’s democratization in the following decades.\n\n\n조용기 趙鏞基David Yonggi Cho \n\n02/14/1936 ~ 09/14/2021\n\n\nPastor David Yonggi Cho’s activities during the 1970s marked a pivotal transformation in both the theology and social practice of the Korean church. During this time, as Yoido Full Gospel Church entered a period of rapid expansion, he systematized Pentecostal pneumatology while placing the care for marginalized populations at the heart of his ministry. On September 23, 1973, Yoido Full Gospel Church dedicated a 10,000-seat main sanctuary and hosted the 10th World Pentecostal Conference in Seoul, rising to global prominence within the Pentecostal movement. At this event, Cho declared, “Through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit... the church shall march on unhindered”.\n\nPastor Cho’s ministry directly confronted the social realities of South Korea’s rapid industrialization and urbanization, which produced significant social instability. Amid political repression and economic disparity, he envisioned the church as a “healing community offering hope to the poor.” His theological framework—expressed through the “Fivefold Gospel” and “Threefold Blessing”—went beyond doctrinal systems to function as a “spiritual and practical faith that simultaneously offers assurance of salvation and life transformation”. Reflecting on the desperation he witnessed, Cho recalled, “They were people in despair. The solution was to give them hope. I preached messages of hope from Genesis to Revelation based on 3 John 1:2. As a result, people were transformed, and those in despair began to smile again”.\n\nThis practical theology was implemented through a structured ministry strategy. In the 1970s, Cho introduced the cell group system, which enabled small community units within the church to provide prayer, counseling, and service—not only to church members but also to those in surrounding communities. Each cell group identified those in need, reported cases to the upper pastoral leadership, and ensured sustained support. Cho emphasized that “care must not be a one-time act, but continued until full restoration is achieved”.\n\nBeyond spiritual care and church growth, Cho stood at the center of Korea’s most contentious theological debates. His Pentecostal theology—which emphasized spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues, healing, and prophecy—was met with strong opposition from Reformed theologians, especially within Presbyterian circles. Park Hyung-ryong, in particular, published criticisms in the Shinhak Jinan journal, asserting that “regeneration and Spirit baptism are one and the same and occur only once.” In response, Cho defended his view through articles in Shinang-gye, stating, “Tongues are a powerful outward sign of Spirit-filled experience,” though he also sought to defuse tensions by clarifying, “I do not say that tongues are Spirit baptism itself”.\n\nTo further clarify and legitimize his theology, Cho published The Holy Spirit in 1971, a work widely regarded as “a compelling guidebook with an expansive interdenominational readership.” This book explained gifts of the Spirit such as tongues, healing, and power in systematic terms and argued that Pentecostal faith did not contradict evangelical orthodoxy. He also cited the 1970 decision of the United Presbyterian Church in the USA to affirm the biblical validity of glossolalia, using this to demonstrate that “Pentecostal pneumatology can be theologically embraced within the evangelical tradition”. Additionally, Cho sought out dialogue with progressive theologians and religious scholars to widen academic understanding of religious experience beyond confessional boundaries.\n\nThus, Pastor Cho’s 1970s ministry was not merely about institutional expansion but redefined the role of the Korean church in both spiritual and social dimensions. He offered a vision of Pentecostal revival that validated spiritual experience while compelling the church to respond to the cries of society’s most vulnerable. His church became a refuge for the urban poor, women, and the disenfranchised, and his theology empowered a new religious imagination that continues to shape global Pentecostalism.\n\n\n 김준곤 金俊坤  Jun Gon Kim\n\n03/2/1925 ~ 09/29/2000\n\n\nRev. Joon Gon Kim's ministry in the 1970s was one of the most comprehensive religious campaigns in modern Korean Christianity, intertwining evangelism, national renewal, and social transformation. Rather than limiting his efforts to preaching the gospel, Kim envisioned a full-scale evangelization of the Korean people—spiritual, cultural, and political—through a theological lens shaped by personal suffering and reformist convictions. His national evangelization movement emerged as a strategic response to the historical and political challenges of postwar Korea, including its authoritarian modernization under President Park Chung-hee.\n\nRev. Kim publicly launched the National Evangelization Movement on December 31, 1970, during a special year-end broadcast on CBS. He had already proposed the idea to President Park Chung-hee, and by February 1970, the movement had begun with state-level approval. As noted, “Rev. Joon Gon Kim initiated the National Believer Movement in February 1970, following his proposal to President Park in 1969.” This marked the beginning of a collaboration—albeit uneasy at times—between evangelical leaders and state power during Korea’s Yushin period.\n\nThe partnership between Kim and the Park regime was a calculated attempt to expand the reach of the gospel across Korean society. He did not shy away from working with political authorities to amplify the evangelical message. The mass revival rally EXPLO '74, which drew hundreds of thousands to Yeouido, Seoul, demonstrated Kim’s willingness to utilize state infrastructure to pursue spiritual goals. However, this alignment also provoked criticism. Observers accused the movement of “blurring the line between the gospel and nationalism,” especially in its use of state language and nationalistic rhetoric. Nonetheless, Kim’s approach reflected a pragmatic theology—one that prioritized the evangelization of the nation over political neutrality. In his own words, “Rather than clinging to political neutrality, the church must engage even unbelievers for the sake of the gospel. We are called to be the light of the world, not to isolate ourselves.”\n\nKim’s sense of mission was deeply rooted in his personal history of suffering. Born in 1925 in Shinan County, Jeolla Province, he grew up in poverty and witnessed multiple family tragedies. “He saw his cousin freeze to death, another sibling die from burns, and another struck dead by a falling tree,” and later, during the Korean War, his father and wife were killed by communist forces. These experiences, rather than crushing him, solidified his commitment to a divine vision: “It was then that I fully gave my life to the Lord and received the vision of national evangelization as my personal mission.” This vision was sharpened during his time in Manchuria in 1944, where, in hiding from Japanese conscription, he encountered Kim In-seok, a holiness pastor with a personal library of over 2,000 volumes. There, Kim combined fasting and study, forming a theology that was both intellectually rigorous and spiritually fervent. He later stated that “evangelization means giving every person a chance to believe in Jesus, discipling believers to become disciple-makers, and allowing the gospel to transform culture, society, and the nation.”\n\nKim’s theological grounding was also shaped by his resistance to liberal theology. Initially enrolled at Chosun Theological Seminary, he left due to its modernist tendencies and transferred to Korea Theological Seminary in Busan, where he studied under Dr. Hyung Ryong Park. Kim became a staunch proponent of Reformed evangelicalism, upholding “the authority of Scripture and the sovereignty of Christ.” This theological foundation later informed the structure of CCC’s national and global missions.\n\nThe 1970s also saw Kim develop two distinctive strategies for realizing his vision: the Holy City Movement (Sungshihwa) and EXPLO '74. The Holy City Movement, launched in Chuncheon in 1972, was inspired by two models: John Calvin’s Geneva and the martyr-evangelist Moon Jun-gyeong. Kim envisioned the church as a \"moral city center\" that would meet both the spiritual and material needs of citizens. He stated, “Chuncheon should become a model city where God’s sovereignty reaches every domain—like Calvin’s Geneva.” Moon’s example of sacrificial ministry among the poor and unchurched deeply shaped Kim’s belief that the church should serve the entire city, not just its members.\n\nThus, Kim’s national evangelization strategy fused rigorous theology, personal tragedy, and a profound vision of national redemption. It sought to turn Korea into a “Jesus nation,” not through coercion, but through discipleship, spiritual renewal, and social transformation. His message was one of total gospelization—a cultural, national, and global campaign in which the gospel of Jesus Christ would reign over every sphere of life.\n\n\n안병무  安炳茂  Byung-mu Ahn\n\n06/23/1922 ~ 10/19/1996\n\n\nAhn Byung-mu emerged in the 1970s as a theological revolutionary who faced the Yushin regime and military dictatorship head-on. In 1972, his short article “Jesus and Minjung” introduced ochlos (ὄχλος) as a theological category, boldly declaring that the minjung are the true historical subject and that Jesus is found among them. He recalled, “I did not see the suffering of the minjung as individual suffering, but as collective. Under the dictatorship, I thought everyone was minjung.”\n\nIn 1975, with the publication of The Liberator Jesus, he made his theology of minjung more explicit, confronting state violence and reclaiming the narrative of Jesus not as a metaphysical savior, but as a historical event of liberation. In 1976, Ahn was arrested for participating in the March 1st Declaration for National Salvation, underscoring the indivisibility of his theology and political praxis.\n\nHis theological praxis was grounded in institutional and intellectual strategy. During this decade, Ahn founded the Korea Theological Study Institute, which served as the base for organizing and expanding minjung theology. It was not simply a research center but a “space that not only led theological discourse in the 1970s and 1980s but also created a unique tradition of Korean academic theology that could be presented globally.”\n\nAhn’s concept of minjung transcended time and place. He regarded the colonized under Japanese rule, postwar rural migrants, and those oppressed under the Yushin regime as all expressions of the same historical subject. As he explained, minjung represented “those who suffer across historical contexts—collectively bearing the burden of history.” The Ahn of the 1970s was not merely a thinker but a prophetic voice—one who bridged faith, resistance, and the suffering people.\n\n \n\n\n\n문익환 文益煥 Ik-hwan Moon\n\n06/01/1918 ~ 01/18/1994\n\n\nThe 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan’s vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea’s authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.\n\nRaised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev. Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, “Solving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,” acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.\n\nIn the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled “Human Rights of 50 Million Koreans.” The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement—“Jeon Tae-il’s death is not a grave, not the end of life—it is a resurrection that brings new hope”—reflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation's conscience. Moon’s activism found fuller expression during South Korea’s pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (민통련), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the “economic democratization of everyday life,” arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor.\n\nBut the most defining moment of Moon’s prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North’s regime: “The most serious obstacle to reunification from the South’s point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn’t Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?” Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. “I did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,” he told Kim.\n\nThis encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4·2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:\n\nThe three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity\n\nThat Korea, despite its division, is “one nation and one state”\n\nA shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions\n\nA consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately\n\nThis framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a “loose federal system.” Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society—and the Christian community in particular—was starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely “Mr. Moon Ik-hwan” to deny his clerical identity. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.\n\nIn contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon’s visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality.\n\nDespite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that “reunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.” His vision transcended the binary of \"reunification first\" or \"democratization first,\" instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon’s legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as “a reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.”\n\n\nTable 1.  Moon’s Key Activities\n\n| Year | Activity/Event | Type | Significance/Reaction |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Start of activities in the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification | Politics · Reunification | Institutionalization of civilian-led reunification efforts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1983 | Elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall | Human Rights · Memorial | Inheriting the legacy of the labor movement and expanding public support |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987 | Participation in the June Democratic Uprising | Democratization | Participation in mass civil resistance; mixed response from religious communities |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989 | Visit to Pyongyang and meeting with Kim Il-sung | Reunification · Religion | Historic civilian inter-Korean dialogue; arrested upon return |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n김수환 추기경 金壽煥 Stephen Kim Sou-hwan\n\n07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009\n\n\nCardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike. \n\nHis moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. “If the government sends troops to Gwangju,” he warned, “it will be an unforgivable sin in Korea’s modern history”. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.\n\nThe defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them—but protected them. “The Church must remain a place of peace,” he said. “Violence cannot coexist with the Church”. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.\n\nHe recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. “Justice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,” he declared. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.\n\nHe never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: “What truly damages the people’s dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it”. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‘apolitical,’ he challenged that notion, stating, “Whenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.”\n\nKim’s resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. “If there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,” he said. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. “Through suffering,” one widow told him years after her husband’s death, “I drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.”\n\nCardinal Kim’s greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him—not out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.\n\nHe believed that the Church must not only answer to God—it must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.\n\n\nTable 2.

Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea’s authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No. 9, he became convinced that “personal goodness was powerless before structural evil” and expanded his pastoral practice “from saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.”\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled “The Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots” delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a “murderer,” accused the U.S. of “complicity in the massacre,” and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent. This was more than a spiritual message—it was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.\n\nKo emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized “democratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.”\n\nFrom the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (비전향 장기수), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come “after democratization” and that Christian reunification must be rooted in “love as the foundation.” Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their “conversion, human rights, and faith transformation” as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, “opened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.”\n\nWithin the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof. Choi Young-geun noted, Ko’s theology was “a lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,” grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.\n\nHis consistent proclamation—that true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed—remains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.\n\n\nTable 3. Key Activities\n\n\n| Year | Activity | Type | Description and Significance | Outcome |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Kim Jae-gyu Clemency Campaign | Human Rights / Political Resistance | Advocated for clemency for the man who assassinated Park Chung-hee.

During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.\n\nOne of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, “It was an obedience to the mission given by God.” He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance.\n\nHis hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a “man of faith in politics,” and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, “Let the river of freedom flow.” This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life.\n\nChristian media and national outlets portrayed Kim’s actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the “Presbyterian president” in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics.\n\nMoreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim’s actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.\n\nIn summary, Kim Young-sam’s political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea’s democratization.\n\n\n한경직 韓景職 Kyung-Chik Han\n\n12/29/1902 ~ 04/19/2000\n\n\nDuring the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.\n\nHis presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a “movement of national purification through the gospel”. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.\n\nWhen the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea’s burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han’s reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.\n\nHe redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea’s “Golden Fishing Ground” for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.\n\nHan’s leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church—especially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches—Han served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han’s message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps.\n\nPerhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987–88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid—carried out through church networks rather than government agencies—demonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel's call to love enemies and feed the hungry. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.\n\nThroughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church’s vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women’s shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that “the church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins”. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han’s ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.\n\nIn all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik’s legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force—firm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.\n\n\nTable 4.

Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the “Seoul Spring.” Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan’s military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.\n\nOn May 17, 1980, Chun’s military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This “Kim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case” was the centerpiece of Chun’s strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, “The two distinct events—Kim’s alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre—were deliberately linked by the military regime’s fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance”.\n\nThrough military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but “a political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship”. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States\n\nDuring his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his Letters from Prison, Kim wrote, “Following Jesus means bearing the cross—that is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged”. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as “the liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner”.\n\nHis prison writings articulate a theology of “social salvation” grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. “True Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,” he wrote. “Without both, we cannot claim to have real faith”. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: “If Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well”.\n\nHis return to Korea in 1985—despite the threat of renewed repression—marked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.\n\nTo the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. “If there were no God,” he once said, “there would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to”. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, “Kim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation—precisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives”.\n\nIn retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung’s theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology—a discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.\n\n\nKim Dae-jung vs. Kim Young-sam in the 1980s\n\nThe inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung’s long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea’s democratic transition—one marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.\n\nTo highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam’s major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea’s path to democracy—revealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.\n\n\nTable 5.

More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho’s innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers.\n\nAt the heart of Cho’s theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public's longing for restoration and wholeness. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho’s teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho’s doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology’s understanding of regeneration. Cho’s sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. “The message of 3 John 1:2,” he often said, “declares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers”. His leadership style was transcendental—based on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit’s indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy.\n\nIn 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho’s theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an “occult healing” gospel. Others labeled his theology as “New Age Christianity.” Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful.\n\nDespite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho’s ministry into the Protestant mainstream. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach.\n\nIn sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy—massive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.\n\n\nTable 7.

Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea’s ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Rev. Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology. \n\nIn 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic “Declaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace” (commonly known as the “’88 Declaration”), which Rev. Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation. \n\nThe apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev. Kwon and Dr. Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev. Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled “Jesus Christ Who Makes Us One,” based on Ephesians 2:13–18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995. Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev. Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events. \n\nThese were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul’s shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea’s rapidly industrializing society. \n\nDuring his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev. Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform. \n\nRev. Kwon’s 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony—“What remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope”—continues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today. \n\n\n최성묵 목사 Sung-mook Choi\n\n11/11/1930 ~ 03/22/1992\n\n\nRev. Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church’s youth group—a movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising).\n\nThe Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime—marking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system’s survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting “Abolish Yushin!” and soon clashed with police and government buildings. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee’s assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.\n\nIn response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising’s ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.\n\nRev. Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea’s Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising—a clear example of the regime’s ideological paranoia. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute – Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as “a social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,” advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism.\n\nChoi’s initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens’ Council (1985) and later the Citizens' Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan’s civic and democratic infrastructure.\n\n\n박형규 목사 \n\n08/25/1923 ~ 08/18/2016\n\n\nRev. Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation—they became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.\n\nFollowing the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime’s nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as Kukbon) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.\n\nIn June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations—including labor groups, teachers’ unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances—Park provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. “Prayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,” he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.\n\nPark’s participation was not merely political—it was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, “Jesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.” In his sermons, he often declared, “Peace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.” Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.\n\nTheologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park’s contributions by noting that “as a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,” and that his efforts “had a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.” Park’s solidarity was not simply a political choice—it was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.\n\n\n지학순 주교 池學淳 Daniel Tji Hak-soun\n\n09/09/1921 ~ 05/12/1993\n\n\nBishop Tji Hak-soun’s activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church’s model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become “the face of Christ” in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.\n\nHis imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church’s calling in an oppressive era. It was said that “he offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,” showing that the Church’s neutrality could yield to the demand for justice. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church’s active role in Korea’s democratization movement throughout the 1980s.\n\nHis commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, “Priests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year’s pastoral goals”. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council’s call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world.\n\nHe opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.\n\nAmong his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers’ Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, “Bishop Tji, along with Fr. Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread”.\n\nHis activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of \"Integral Human Development,\" which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded “ecological conversion” that changes one’s lifestyle. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis’s teaching on integral ecology in Laudato Si’.\n\nTji’s theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for “the decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity”. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ’s love in the world.\n\nBishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church’s vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice—seeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.\n\n\nTable 8. Key Activities and Significance of Bishop Tji\n\n| Year / Period | Activity | Significance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 (early) | Led Masses and public statements for justice, peace, and human rights | Offered a model of faith-based resistance to political oppression and reaffirmed the Church’s social mission. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1984 | Participated in Catholic Farmers’ Movement and life-based ecology activism | Implemented Catholic social teaching through life-centered agriculture and ecological justice. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1985 | Promoted urban-rural direct trade networks | Proposed an alternative community model through solidarity between producers and consumers. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1986 | Organized cooperatives and founded grassroots schools | Helped the marginalized gain self-reliance, turning the Church into a center for education and economic development. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mid-1980s | Supported and spread the early Hansalim Movement | Provided theological and organizational grounding for a consumer-led life and justice movement. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1985–1989 | Advocated for decentered ecclesiology | Provided theological foundation for a Church that serves Christ and humanity rather than institutional self-preservation. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1986–1989 | Initiated the founding of the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) | Played a pivotal role in systematizing the Korean Catholic Church’s involvement in democratization movements. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987 | Participated in democratization campaigns post-June Struggle | Supported democratic transition with spiritual leadership and civic solidarity. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Late 1980s | Embodied Vatican II teachings in local Church reforms | Deeply understood and implemented the Church’s role in the modern world, promoting decentralization and reform. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n김지하 金芝河 Ji-ha Kim\n\n02/04/1941 ~ 05/08/2022\n\n\nThe 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941–2022), one of South Korea’s most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life—what he came to call saengmyeong sasang (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.\n\nKim's post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with Jang Il-soon and Bishop Ji Hak-soon in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being “calm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement”. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report “The Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life”, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals.\n\nYet Kim's journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:\n\n“I am returning to my hometown.”“Where, Mokpo?”“No, Donghak.”“You mean Cheondogyo?”“No, my own inner Donghak.”\n\nKim named this internal shift “Won Donghak” (Original Donghak)—a revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.\n\nHis ecological vision, articulated in texts like \"I Am Rice\", \"The Song of the Southern Boat\", and \"The Carrier of Life: The Minjung\", offered a new framework for Korean minjung discourse. For Kim, the minjung were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of life (saengmyeong), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos.\n\nThis transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim’s departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak—“my own inner Donghak”—provoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church’s boundaries.\n\nSecond, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim’s redefinition of minjung as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms—a framework that seeded the development of minjung ecology, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities.\n\nFinally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha’s saengmyeong sasang contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based saenghwal undong (life movement), and early versions of Korea’s environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim’s influence. His insistence that “a revolution must also be spiritual” extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.\n\nWhile he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called “a creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos” signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought.\n\n\nTable 9.  Religious Transformation and Social Impact\n\n| Period | Religious Identity / Orientation | Key Activities | Societal Impact |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960s–1970s | Catholic-influenced lay activist | Studied Vatican II documents with Jang Il-soon and Ji Hak-soon; supported justice-centered Catholicism. | Strengthened the link between Catholic social teaching and the democratization movement in Wonju. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Early 1980s | Catholic–Minjung hybrid thinker | Co-authored “The Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life”; initiated ecological discourse. | Inspired progressive theologians and activists to rethink minjung through ethics of life and coexistence. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mid–Late 1980s | “Won Donghak” (Original Donghak); personal syncretic spirituality | Declared spiritual departure from institutional religion; promoted saengmyeong sasang rooted in Donghak and ecology. | Encouraged the founding of Hansalim and life cooperatives; offered an alternative to both church and Marxist dogma. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n장기려 張起呂Gi-ryeo Jang\n\n10/05/1911 ~ 12/25/1995\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Dr. Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea’s first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea. Prior to the launch of Korea’s National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.\n\nFounded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. “Anyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,” making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that “ensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision”.\n\nDr. Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative’s newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, “The Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth”.\n\nThe cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea’s health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40–50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%.\n\nWhen the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr. Jang’s leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.\n\n\nTable 10.

Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan’s regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published Stories of Minjung Theology and other key works that consolidated his theological system.\n\nDuring this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection Korean National Movement and Reunification developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that “true unification must come from the people themselves.” He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (ki), overcoming anti-unification forces (seung), emergence of minjung as agents (jeon), and realizing peace through minjung (gyeol).\n\nAhn’s most striking development in this era was his deepening of minjung messianism. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida’s idea of the messianic without messianism, he argued that minjung messiah “does not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.” This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.\n\nToward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from “activist theology” to a more sensitive “theology of suffering.” He lamented that “migrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives—even within minjung theology.”⁷ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward “the different textures of suffering.” This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.\n\n\n김준곤 목사 金俊坤 Joon Gon Kim\n\n03/28/1925 ~ 09/29/2009\n\n\nRev. Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea’s evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan—“the whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city”—reflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.\n\nKim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin’s Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin’s Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a \"substitute beggar,\" a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people’s daily needs with sacrificial love.\n\nIn the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the “EXPO ’80” World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the “100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,” embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing.\n\nKim’s emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the \"Love’s Long Johns Project,\" the \"Organ Donation Campaign,\" the \"Coal Briquette Sharing Movement,\" free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill. In 1996, he launched the “Food Bank” movement, advocating the biblical principle that “the right to live surpasses the right to property” in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea. By 2007, he initiated the “North Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,” in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North.\n\nKim’s theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant’s emphasis on “both the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian’s social responsibility.” He consistently modeled what he called the “Whole Gospel”—a unified ministry of evangelism and justice.\n\nThis theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until “Christ becomes Lord of all.” He declared this “Jesus Revolution” in his New Year’s Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement.\n\nUltimately, Kim Jun-gon’s ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view—a model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.\n\n\n이영빈  목사 Young-Bin Lee\n\n1926 ~ 12/14/2018\n\n\nIn the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity—it was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the “third way,” which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.\n\nLee was deeply influenced by Barth’s vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.\n\nHe saw reunification as a theological task: “The gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders—it tears them down”. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God’s justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides—a prophetic confrontation with history. “Both North and South must confess their sins toward one another,” he repeatedly emphasized.\n\nThis perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that “the community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.” He famously declared, “In Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God”. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.\n\nLee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church’s own language—evangelism, worship, and prayer. “Prayer,” he said, “transcends confrontation and makes solidarity possible”. During the first North–South religious dialogue, participants prayed together—a moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.\n\nAt the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. “The Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,” he said. He further warned, “When Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross”. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.\n\nLee’s praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings—they were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAs Lee often said, “True reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God’s people”. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative—one that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.\n\n\nDorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)\n\n02/24/1938 ~ 08/30/2024\n\n\nThe 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.\n\nSchweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. “She had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture”. She assisted in editing Ahn’s letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as Jürgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.\n\nHer mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers’ protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation—she served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. “She was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches”.\n\nIn May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: “Her circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea’s democratic movement”. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as “someone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea’s situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution”.\n\nOne of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu’s long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. “She was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile”.\n\nSchweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center’s operations.\n\nHer work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, “Korea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth”.\n\nDorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present—listening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.\n\n\n\n김영삼 金泳三 Young-sam Kim\n\n01/14/1929 ~ 11/22/2015\n\n\nKim Young-sam’s political and religious engagement in the 1990s must be understood not merely as a milestone in Korea’s democratization but as a defining moment in the politicization of Protestant Christianity in South Korea. As the first “Elder-President” of South Korea, Kim Young-sam embodied the convergence of religious conviction and political ambition, marking a profound shift in the relationship between church and state. \n\nKim’s 1992 presidential campaign marked a turning point in Korean Protestant political activism. As a well-known elder of Chungguhyun Church, Kim received enthusiastic support from conservative Protestant circles. At the height of the campaign, a “prayer breakfast for candidate Kim Young-sam was held at the 63 Building in Seoul, attended by over 1,000 pastors, showcasing the consolidated political power of Protestantism”. Slogans such as “Let a believer win the election” and “Let hymns echo from Jangwi-dae” were shouted across churches nationwide.\n\nOne of the most significant events in this context was the 1992 declaration titled \"The Future of Korean Politics Is in the Hands of Christianity,\" held at the Christian Cultural Center in Seoul. This meeting marked the first time Protestant leaders openly claimed a political mandate, asserting, “Christianity can no longer remain neutral in politics”]. Organized by leading pastors from megachurches such as Yoido Full Gospel Church and Chungguhyun Church, the declaration set the precedent for large-scale religious intervention in elections. It also promoted a narrative that pitted Protestantism against rival religious influences, particularly Buddhism and Catholicism.\n\nThe Protestant mobilization went far beyond simple endorsements. As Kim Young-sam declared, “I will not campaign on Sundays,” appealing directly to Protestant sensibilities and gaining the trust of churchgoers who viewed Sabbath observance as sacred. Conservative Christian leaders responded by establishing prayer cells and holding election seminars in over 170 regions under the slogan of national evangelization. “What had previously been silent support now became a well-organized electoral force,” effectively turning churches into campaign hubs.\n\nThis religious mobilization led to a political climate where, as noted by scholars, “the Protestant church gained the ability to influence elections structurally”. Pastors publicly declared the need for Christian political empowerment, with some asserting, “We must no longer remain passive—we must become a political force”. The Korean Christian Federation (Han Ki Chong), formed around this time, played a significant role in coordinating Protestant political activities and became an institutional platform for subsequent political advocacy.\n\nThe result of this mobilization was a resounding electoral victory in Busan and Gyeongnam—Kim’s strongholds—where he secured over 60% of the vote, propelled by the church’s organizational strength. This alignment of religious infrastructure with electoral strategy not only secured Kim’s presidency but also ushered in an era of Protestant political ascendancy. As sociologist Jung Tae-sik observes, Kim Young-sam and his evangelical allies “acted as a salvation aristocracy, using political means to achieve religious ends and embedding evangelical absolutism within state governance”.\n\nUltimately, Kim Young-sam’s presidency symbolized the apex of Protestant political influence in modern Korean history. It marked a new phase in church-state relations—one where “megachurches no longer avoided politics but claimed a rightful place in national leadership”. Through Kim’s rise, the Protestant church transformed from a religious community into a political actor, institutionalizing its voice within Korea’s democratic landscape.\n\n\n김수환 추기경 金壽煥 Stephen Kim Sou-hwan\n\n07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan remained a beacon of moral leadership in South Korea, steering his influence toward reconciliation, economic justice, and interfaith solidarity during a time of national transformation. Following his pivotal role in the democratization movement of the 1980s, Kim continued his public advocacy, grounded in a theology of human dignity and social responsibility.\n\nOne of the most significant and symbolic acts of the decade occurred during the 1997–1998 Asian Financial Crisis. In a period marked by widespread economic despair, rising unemployment, and national debt, the South Korean government launched a campaign to collect gold from the public to repay the country’s $58 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund. Cardinal Kim, then approaching the end of his official tenure as Archbishop of Seoul, donated his gold pectoral cross—the sacred item he received during his episcopal ordination—to this campaign. His act, widely publicized, became a national symbol of solidarity, inspiring many others to contribute personal belongings to help restore the economy.\n\nBeyond economic justice, Cardinal Kim also took bold steps toward inter-Korean reconciliation. In 1995, he established the Committee for the Reconciliation of the Korean People within the Archdiocese of Seoul. This committee launched a weekly “Reconciliation Mass” at Myeongdong Cathedral, where prayers were offered for North Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. These liturgies were accompanied by humanitarian outreach efforts, including food aid and pastoral letters urging Catholics to remember and assist their brethren in the North. His public statements emphasized that true peace could not be achieved by political or military means alone but must begin with the spiritual conversion of hearts and national empathy.\n\nEven as he prepared for retirement, Cardinal Kim remained an active force in shaping public values. In 1998, after serving three decades as Archbishop of Seoul, he became Archbishop Emeritus. Rather than withdrawing from public life, he used his retirement to engage more freely in civic and interreligious initiatives. Notably, he prioritized interreligious dialogue with Buddhist, Protestant, and Confucian leaders. Joint statements and community service projects were launched in partnership with these faith groups, particularly in response to social issues such as poverty, urban alienation, and the moral crisis following rapid modernization.\n\nThroughout the decade, Cardinal Kim continued to speak out against injustice. Though South Korea had transitioned to civilian government, many structural injustices remained, including labor exploitation and social inequality. Kim regularly issued pastoral messages and held press conferences denouncing the suppression of union activities and advocating for the humane treatment of workers. His unwavering commitment to human rights earned him continued respect, especially among labor groups, university students, and grassroots movements.\n\nCardinal Kim’s influence extended beyond religious boundaries. His funeral in 2009 was attended by national leaders from all faiths and political spectrums, but it was in the 1990s that his public image was firmly established as “the conscience of the nation.” His ability to combine deep Catholic spirituality with concrete social action made him one of the most revered figures of modern Korea.\n\n\n함세웅 신부 咸世雄 Se-woong Ham\n\n06/28/1942 ~ Present\n\n\nFather Ham Se-woong (baptismal name: Augustine) was a leading Catholic priest and one of the most symbolic religious figures in South Korea's democratization movement. Throughout the 1990s, even after the end of military rule in 1987, he remained active both inside and outside the Church, emphasizing social justice, reconciliation, and ecclesiastical renewal. His activities in this decade can be understood in four major domains: his continued social movement engagement, his reformist efforts within the Catholic Church, his public speeches and writings, and his overseas and ecumenical solidarity initiatives.\n\nIn terms of social movements, Father Ham was widely regarded as a moral authority in post-authoritarian civil society. He played a critical role in founding and supporting the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities, which focused on revealing and redressing pro-Japanese collaboration during the colonial period. This involvement was part of a broader effort by civil society actors to restore historical justice and national identity in the wake of democratization. In 1993, he also co-chaired the \"Council of Religious Leaders for Reconciliation and Peace,\" a coalition of leaders from various religions that worked for inter-Korean reconciliation through civil and religious diplomacy. His participation represented an attempt to broaden the democratic movement into one of national healing and unity across ideological lines.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Father Ham assumed leadership roles in several civic and political reform coalitions. He became co-chair of the \"National Alliance for Democratic Reform\" in 1998 and the \"National Political Research Association\" in 1999, both of which supported progressive democratic reforms under the Kim Dae-jung administration. Despite the transition to civilian government, he insisted that democratization remained an unfinished task, stating that civic organizations and religious leaders must continue to hold political power accountable and advocate for marginalized groups.\n\nWithin the Catholic Church, Father Ham remained a reformer committed to the spirit of Vatican II. As a professor at the Catholic University of Korea (1974–1992), he trained future priests in socially engaged theology. He argued that the Church should be a prophetic voice against structural injustice, not an institution of comfort. In 1996, he helped launch the \"Gaudium et Spes Pastoral Institute\" to promote theological renewal rooted in liberation theology. He believed that the priesthood was not just a sacramental office but a vocation of solidarity with the poor.\n\nIn the 1994 controversy over statements by Father Park Hong, then president of Sogang University, who claimed radical leftist groups were infiltrating college campuses, Father Ham publicly condemned such red-baiting rhetoric. He and the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) denounced the remarks as baseless ideological attacks, and the courts later ruled against Park Hong. This incident clearly illustrated the divide within the Catholic Church between progressives like Father Ham and more conservative clergy.\n\nFather Ham also spoke critically of the Church's declining role in democratic advocacy during the 1990s. He lamented that the Archdiocese of Seoul and figures like Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan became increasingly cautious, stating that \"when the Church ceases to stand with the suffering, it loses its prophetic calling and risks becoming an opiate.\"\n\nThrough interviews, sermons, and essays, Father Ham maintained a steady public presence. He published numerous books throughout the 1990s, including Jesus Who Came to Set Fire, Jesus Who Brought the Sword, Yoke and Cross: The Church's Role in Social Critique, and Why Be a Priest?. These writings provided theological justification for clergy involvement in struggles for justice, arguing that Jesus himself sided with the oppressed.\n\nHe consistently challenged the National Security Law, calling it an \"idolatrous law that sows fear and division\" and criticizing those who defended it as guilty of moral blindness. His rhetoric, though sometimes controversial, remained grounded in Catholic social teaching and liberation theology.\n\nWhile his main activities remained domestic, Father Ham also engaged in international solidarity efforts. Through his leadership in interfaith councils, he helped facilitate dialogue with Korean diaspora communities and religious groups in Japan and the United States. During the North Korean famine in the mid-1990s, he led fundraising campaigns among Catholic parishes and advocated for humanitarian aid as a moral imperative. He called on religious leaders to prioritize shared humanity over Cold War ideologies.\n\nFather Ham often cited Brazilian Archbishop Helder Camara as a major influence. Camara’s maxim, \"When I feed the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist,\" shaped Father Ham's vision of a prophetic Church that demands both charity and structural change.\n\nIn sum, Father Ham Se-woong’s activities in the 1990s illustrate his enduring commitment to a faith that serves the people. He bridged the gap between street-level activism and theological reflection, becoming a symbol of Korea’s moral conscience. Even after democratization, he believed the role of clergy was not to retreat but to deepen the Church’s mission in solidarity with the oppressed. His example inspired a new generation of socially conscious religious leaders who viewed justice as integral to discipleship.\n\n\n하용조  河用祚 Yong-jo Ha\n\n09/20/1946 ~ 08/02/2011\n\n\nHa Yong-jo's ministry in the 1990s, its significance, and historical context represent a key theological and pastoral development that emerged during a transformative period in the Korean church. He is especially noted for the growth of Onnuri Church, the establishment of a missional church model, and his embodiment of “Reformed Life Theology”. The 1990s marked a period when Korean Protestantism began to decline after decades of rapid growth. Until the 1980s, the church had enjoyed explosive expansion, but criticisms against patriarchal pastoral structures, disillusionment with authoritarian leadership, and broader democratic and globalizing social currents began influencing Korean Christianity. Middle-class believers increasingly desired liber Ibid.ation from rigid, hierarchical church cultures. From 1995 to 2005, the number of Protestant adherents declined by 1.6%, while Catholicism rose by 74.4% and Buddhism by 3.9%. Amid this overall decline, Onnuri Church experienced phenomenal growth.\n\nFounded in 1985 by Pastor Ha Yong-jo, Onnuri Church expanded rapidly during the 1990s, establishing a wide range of ministries. He reorganized the traditional church model through small-group-based worship communities, open praise and sermon-centered worship, and the empowerment of lay leadership. Based on a worship experience in England, he envisioned a Spirit-filled church like that in the Acts of the Apostles, recalling that “people gathered tightly in a small chapel, raised their hands in praise, worship ran over an hour, and the congregation responded with applause and dance. The communion was full of tears and emotion”. Such worship enabled deep emotional and spiritual engagement.\n\nThere were five main reasons why Koreans responded so strongly to Onnuri Church’s model. First, it responded to the weariness many felt toward patriarchal churches and their longing for alternative communities. Traditional Korean churches were steeped in Confucian authority and development-era authoritarianism. Ha provided “religious alternative spaces” that allowed believers to subvert oppressive ecclesial norms. Second, it effectively combined cultural sensitivity with mass appeal. Unlike traditional worship, Onnuri’s format—where people raised hands, clapped, and wept together—allowed congregants to embody their faith through expressive action. Through John Fiske’s cultural theory, this phenomenon can be interpreted as believers reappropriating dominant codes to form their own symbolic religious practices. Third, it integrated media and educational ministries into everyday life. Onnuri Church launched CGNTV, Duranno Publishing, Onnuri Newspaper, and welfare foundations. The 1995 launch of the Duranno Father School, a program that redefined Christian masculinity and addressed family restoration, was a major success. These were not merely programs, but a lifestyle-centered gospel movement. Fourth, it empowered lay ministry and leadership. Onnuri trained lay leaders to run small groups, teach the Bible, and engage in missions. This shift from passive to active discipleship offered a new participatory model of the church, which contrasted sharply with top-down traditional models. Fifth, it projected a global vision. Guided by the motto “To the Ends of the Earth,” Ha Yong-jo planted campuses in Japan, the U.S., and Latin America, implementing a glocalized mission combining media and church planting. This vision appealed especially to younger generations with global identities.\n\nTheologically, Ha Yong-jo is seen as a practitioner of Reformed Life Theology, which emphasized not scholastic theology but the lived experience of faith. He declared, “Theology is not an academic discipline. The Word and the Spirit—these are the core of theology. Knowing God with the heart and praying on one’s knees while experiencing the Word—that is true theology”. This theology rejected detached abstraction and sought to unify experiential piety with biblical truth.\n\nHa’s work in the 1990s did not merely build a megachurch but restructured the entire pastoral and theological landscape of Korean Christianity. His efforts to establish a participatory, culturally relevant, and Spirit-led community laid the groundwork for many missional and megachurch models that followed. His legacy offers a clear direction for Korean church renewal: unity between worship and life, Scripture and culture, theology and spirituality.\n\n\n옥한흠 玉漢欽 Han-heum Oak\n\n12/05/1938 ~ 09/02/2010\n\n\nPastor Oak Han-heum’s ministry during the 1990s, its historical background, and significance can be understood as a decisive expression of pastoral leadership that led both the awakening of the laity and the reform of the church amid the structural crisis and theological confusion that began in the late 1980s in the Korean church. The 1990s marked a period when Korean churches, having reached the peak of quantitative growth, entered a phase of internal crisis marked by spiritual stagnation, authoritarian pastoral leadership, and growing conflicts and divisions within congregations. In this context, Pastor Oak initiated a dual strategy of \"discipleship ministry\" and \"church renewal through preaching,\" offering a turning point for the Korean church.\n\nFrom the founding of Sarang Church in 1978 into the 1990s, Oak Han-heum sought to transition the church's center from clergy to laypeople. He resisted the traditional authoritarian structures of church operation and emphasized that every believer was a bearer of apostolic succession, called to proclaim the gospel. He declared that “believers are all heirs of apostolicity…called to make disciples of all nations,” thereby positioning the laity not as passive recipients of ministry but as co-laborers in the work of the church. This vision deeply resonated with the self-development ethos of Korean society and took root not merely as a strategy for church growth but as a full reformation of the ecclesial structure.\n\nThis training-centered pastoral philosophy found fertile ground in Korea’s culture, which values education and diligence. Oak’s discipleship ministry motivated believers to pursue post-conversion life transformation through disciplined faith. He emphasized that “those saved must live as befits the people of God,” underlining the necessity of a holy calling as well as righteous identity. While Pastor Ha Yong-jo focused on emotional resonance and relational ministry through culturally open evangelism, Oak emphasized spiritual discipline and responsibility.\n\nIn the 1990s, Sarang Church extended beyond quantitative expansion and began solidifying a missional church model and theological ecclesiology. Oak did not regard the church as merely a place for worship, but as a missionary community called to be salt and light in the world. His discipleship ministry was not a program but a theological strategy to lead believers into holistic obedience to the gospel. He believed that “discipleship is the link that connects soteriology and ecclesiology,” and he rooted his ministry in a gospel-driven ecclesiology that positioned discipleship and sending as the very purpose of the church.\n\nHe also pursued the awakening and reformation of the Korean church through preaching. His sermons revolved around the key themes of ‘awakening’ and ‘reform,’ reinterpreting biblical truths in light of contemporary problems facing the church and society. While grounded in Reformed theology, he practiced a theology “for the church,” not as abstract theory but as pastoral reality. He came to be known as “the preacher who awakened the Korean church”. Above all, he believed that “preaching changes the church,” and practiced expository preaching as the foundation for nurturing believers. Oak’s leadership became even more distinctive in the 1990s. Unlike Ha Yong-jo, who cast visions and expanded ministry creatively, Oak was a reformer of ecclesial structures. He reorganized leadership itself by redesigning organizational, personnel, and training systems around verification and discipline. Ha promoted lay participation through small groups and media missions; Ok built lay leadership through rigorous training and qualification. He was not simply a program operator but a “practical reformer” who staked his ministry on transforming the church’s essence and structure.\n\nIn contrast to Ha Yong-jo, whose leadership emphasized freedom and cultural engagement, Oak insisted on training-verified discipleship. His concern was not only the participation of the laity but their transformation. He developed discipleship into a theological framework, not merely a ministry method. Oak “positioned discipleship as the bridge between soteriology and ecclesiology,” systematizing it into a theological-pastoral model that addressed the very nature of Christian salvation and church life³.\n\nIn conclusion, Pastor Oak Han-heum’s work in the 1990s was not just a strategy for church growth but a crucial contribution to the theological, institutional, and spiritual reconstruction of the Korean church. His ministry and preaching continue to be regarded as a “pastoral alternative for a church in crisis.” As a preacher, theologian, trainer, and ecclesial practitioner, he offered a multifaceted leadership and a systematic answer to the question of “how to reform the church.” As a result, the Korean church could envision transformation not only in outward growth but in becoming a mature and trained community of faith.\n\n\n김진홍  목사 金鎭洪 Jin-hong Kim\n\n06/18/1941 ~ Present\n\n\nPastor Jin-Hong Kim, a prominent Presbyterian (Tonghap) minister and social activist, began his ministry in the slums of Cheonggyecheon during the 1970s and carried that spirit into the 1990s. In the wake of South Korea’s democratization, the 1990s marked a period of ideological transformation and redefinition of public roles for religious institutions. Kim was a key figure in maintaining and reformulating Christian social engagement, particularly by continuing his urban poor and community-centered ministry while also becoming increasingly involved in conservative public discourse and national reform movements.\n\nDuring this decade, Kim continued his community-based ministry at Namyang Bay’s Dure Village, where he had relocated with evicted Cheonggyecheon residents in 1976. The community featured agricultural cooperatives and Christian communal life rooted in land cultivation and economic self-reliance. He once described the move as “a modern-day Exodus,” portraying himself as a Korean version of Moses.\n\nIn 1996, Kim took part in the civic committee to address issues faced by ethnic Koreans in China, particularly North Korean defectors and the Korean-Chinese diaspora. This initiative signaled the Korean church's growing attention to human rights beyond national borders. The following year, in March 1997, Kim moved his ministry from Namyang to Guri, founding what became known as Guri Dure Church. It attracted long-time followers from his previous ministries and rapidly expanded, laying the foundation for what would become one of Korea’s notable socially active churches.\n\nDuring the 1997–98 Asian Financial Crisis, Kim joined the National Movement for the Second Founding of the Republic, a campaign led by various civic, religious, and political figures aimed at restoring national integrity and morality. As a Christian leader, he emphasized personal sacrifice, economic discipline, and the need for spiritual renewal. This period also marked the publication of several influential books by Kim, including Successful Reform, Failed Reform (1996) and Even If You Fall Next to a Trash Can (1998), in which he blended personal testimony with commentary on Korean society’s ethical decline. His works resonated widely, establishing him as both a spiritual and social voice.\n\nWhile his early career had aligned with progressive Christian activism, by the late 1990s, Kim began articulating more conservative theological and economic views. He famously remarked, “After God, money is most important,” and argued that capitalism was “the child of biblical ethics”. These views sparked both admiration and criticism, particularly from theologians and Christians rooted in minjung theology and liberation traditions. Reflecting on his past, Kim once said, “I was neither a democrat nor an activist—I was just imprisoned by accident,” distancing himself from the progressive camp. Nonetheless, he also claimed, “I, too, once protested for democratization,” highlighting the contradictions within his evolving stance.\n\nHis trajectory ultimately laid the foundation for his leadership role in the New Right movement in the early 2000s, but the ideological seeds had already been planted in his 1990s work. In this respect, Kim helped redirect Korean Protestant social engagement from progressive anti-authoritarianism toward a morally driven conservatism. His presence in both civic and church circles exemplified the role of clergy as public intellectuals during Korea’s post-democratic transition.\n\n\n조화순 목사 Hwa-soon Jo\n\n1934 ~ Present\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Reverend Jo Hwa-soon emerged as one of the most pioneering female pastors and popular movement leaders in South Korea. The church she built was not merely a space for worship—it became a living site where residents, workers, and women pursued liberation. Beginning her ministry at Dalwol Church in Siheung, her pastoral work was grounded in the belief that \"the church is the community,\" a conviction that naturally expanded into broader social movements.\n\nTo Reverend Jo, the church was not confined to its walls: “I don’t believe God only dwells inside the church. I think everyone in the local community is a church member.” She engaged directly in the lives of her neighbors—attending weddings and funerals even of non-congregants, contributing condolence or congratulatory funds as a sign of solidarity. In Dalhyeon-ri, elderly residents affectionately called her “our pastor.” When she was once arrested, they sang hymns outside the detention center demanding her release.\n\nWithin the church, Jo fought to elevate the institutional status of female pastors. As President of the Korean Methodist Church’s National Association of Women Pastors, she led reforms that allowed married women to continue pastoral ministry, thereby institutionalizing gender equity in church leadership. She firmly believed that “true faith is enduring to the end,” and she maintained that churches must stand with the powerless in society.\n\nBeyond the church, she was a symbolic figure in South Korea’s labor and democratization movements. While working with the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission from 1966, she labored alongside female factory workers in places like Dong-il Textile Company. Through Bible studies, knitting circles, and flower arrangement clubs, she helped raise consciousness and solidarity among women workers. These efforts led to the historic election of a female union leader at Dong-il—a landmark moment in the history of Korea’s labor movement. Yet the journey was fraught with hardship. In 1978, the infamous “feces incident” occurred, where male workers assaulted female unionists and doused them with excrement. Jo, after delivering public lectures condemning the violence, was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year.\n\nIn the 1990s, she stepped into a more institutionalized form of women’s activism. Serving as the Chair of the Korean Women’s Associations United, she defined femininity as “a warm embrace that comforts others, and the courage to confront injustice.” Her leadership helped define the direction of Christian feminism and bridged the divide between women’s rights activism and the progressive church.\n\nHer influence extended beyond religious or activist circles. In one notable episode, she proposed organizing a public forum in Siheung, inviting the mayor to engage directly with church members on local issues. “Let the officials come to where the believers are, and let us speak to them about Siheung’s problems,” she suggested. This event, held within the church, functioned as a model of civic participation and reflected her view that churches should be centers of local democracy.\n\nJo Hwa-soon’s activities were not merely the passionate work of one pastor. They embodied a lived theology that integrated gospel and justice, women and the people. Her legacy defined a new identity for the Korean clergy—as public theologian, feminist activist, and community organizer.\n\n\n박형규 목사 朴炯圭 Hyung-kyu Park\n\n08/25/1923 ~ 08/18/2016\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Rev. Hyung-Kyu Park’s activities reflected a continuation of his lifelong commitment to embodying the social responsibility of the Church and public engagement of Christian faith. As South Korea transitioned into a consolidated democracy, Park channeled his theological convictions into shaping the moral direction of civil society, guiding student and urban poor movements, and seeking regional reconciliation and peace in East Asia. One of the most symbolic events of this decade was his six-year outdoor worship protest in front of the Seoul Jungbu Police Station, held from 1984 to December 1990. After being forcibly ousted from Seoul Jeil Church due to government pressure and internal conflict, Park began worshipping in the street. This act became a powerful expression of ecclesial freedom and resistance. He declared it “the largest church in the world with the sky as its ceiling and no walls,” making it a living embodiment of the persecuted church.\n\nEven after the military regime gave way to a civilian government, Park warned that the Church must not become complacent. Inspired by Karl Barth’s imperative to “let the Church be the Church,” Park remained critical of the Church’s tendency to side with power or capital. He proclaimed that “even when democracy is institutionalized, the children of light must still rise to resist the forces of darkness”. He believed the Church must speak prophetically in every age, not merely during dictatorship.\n\nIn the 1990s, Park intensified his focus on urban poor ministries and the theological reconfiguration of the minjung (people’s) movement. Drawing from the “Missio Dei” (Mission of God) paradigm, he redefined mission as the liberating work of God in the world—not a function of church expansion or personal salvation alone. He stressed that the true subject of mission is God, and the church is a tool for realizing comprehensive salvation encompassing political, economic, and social liberation. To this end, Park adopted Saul Alinsky’s community organizing methods and Paulo Freire’s conscientization strategies to strengthen grassroots urban movements. Moreover, Park remained a vital mentor in Christian student movements and the second generation of minjung theology. As honorary advisor of the Korean Christian Student Federation (KSCF), which he had helped establish in 1969, Park encouraged a generation of students to develop a faith-based public vocation. His “GO–LOOK–ACT” strategy, developed through the Haksa-dan (Student Social Development Group), continued to guide students toward involvement in issues such as labor, reunification, and environmental justice. Park also played a leading role in reconciliation and peace initiatives between Korean and Japanese churches. In the mid-1990s, he facilitated the partnership between Seoul Jeil Church and Nishikatamachi Church in Japan, promoting historical reconciliation and Christian fellowship beyond national boundaries. This model of cross-national church communion offered a theological vision for East Asian peace rooted in repentance, forgiveness, and shared faith.\n\nThroughout the decade, Park emphasized that the 1990s were not merely the fruit of past struggles but a new beginning. “Faith means facing the darkness of our times and opening a new path within it,” he declared, urging the Church to remain prophetic and engaged. Thus, his work in the 1990s represented not only a continuation of resistance but a reimagining of the Church’s vocation in a democratizing society.\n\n\n이은선  Un Sunn Lee\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Lee Un-sun actively advanced a uniquely Korean feminist theology, seeking to reconstruct theological discourse by integrating East Asian intellectual traditions. She criticized the male-centered and individualistic aspects of Christian soteriology and proposed a “theology of life-giving spirituality,” grounded in everyday female embodiment and Confucian self-cultivation. Rather than passively adopting Western feminist theology, she restructured it within the Korean cultural and spiritual context.\n\nDrawing on Confucian ideals—such as the Way of the Sage (聖人之道), sympathetic heart (惻隱之心), and the unity of all beings (萬物一體)—Lee reformulated salvation theology as a threefold structure: Seong (聖, creativity/transcendence), Seong (性, femininity/otherness), and Seong (誠, sincerity/political ethics). This expanded the concept of salvation beyond the soul’s redemption to a communal vision of transformation, beginning with moral cultivation (修身) and extending to familial harmony, social reform, and ecological solidarity. For Lee, “the sage, who internalizes transcendence through self-cultivation, is the theological agent in the biosphere era.”\n\nShe introduced saengmul (生物, living beings) as a concept surpassing saengmyeong (生命, life), to highlight the relational, creative, and nurturing nature of existence. Her definition of sympathy emphasized that “sympathy must not end in feeling with, but must lead to doing with,” stressing action-based solidarity rooted in empathy. This concept of sympathy—central to her feminist theology—was simultaneously theological and political, emphasizing that divine love is realized through embodied solidarity and communal care. A key articulation of this vision appeared in her 1993 article, “On the Necessity and Meaning of the Encounter between Confucianism and Christianity,” where she argued that both traditions shared a moral and spiritual foundation that could enrich each other in Korean theological thought. She asserted that Christianity’s message of agape and Confucianism’s 仁 (ren) were not contradictory but mutually illuminating. By constructing a theological bridge between the two, she challenged dualistic thinking and asserted a contextual Korean theology of relational salvation.\n\nIn 1997, she expanded this vision in her seminal monograph Postmodern Korean Feminist Theology. There, she argued that Korean feminist theology must move beyond Western feminist assumptions—particularly their focus on individualism and secularism—and instead be rooted in the spiritual, ethical, and communal lifeworld of Korean women. She proposed the Seong·Seong·Seong (聖·性·誠) model as a new theological grammar that integrates transcendence, embodied femininity, and public ethics. Salvation, she claimed, is not only liberation from sin but a “life-giving transformation” of all relationships—self, household, society, and nature.\n\nIn 1998, Lee applied these theological insights in a more public-facing theological reflection titled “Shalom—Sex is No Longer Destiny.” There, she boldly declared that gender roles are not divine mandates but human constructs shaped by patriarchy. “To say that sex is no longer destiny,” she wrote, “is to declare the restoration of human subjectivity and the image of God within every woman.” She called on the Korean church to renounce gender fatalism and to embrace a vision of shalom—a peace rooted in justice, equality, and mutual flourishing.\n\nLee’s feminist theology, shaped in the crucible of Korea’s Confucian-Christian context, rejected both patriarchal conservatism and uncritical Western imports. Instead, she forged an alternative rooted in embodied spirituality, ecological awareness, and ethical interdependence. Her work was quickly taken up as a foundational framework in the Korean Women’s Theological Society, where her bridging of Confucianism and Christianity enabled a new wave of indigenous theological reflection.\n\nThrough these writings, Lee not only challenged the structures of domination embedded in theology but also invited a renewed vision of salvation—as a communal, ecological, and justice-oriented practice. Her vision of “a transformative big bang of salvation beginning with one woman and one household” became emblematic of Korean feminist theology’s most profound aspirations.\n\n\n이재철 목사 Jae-chul Lee\n\n1949 ~ Present\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Pastor Jae-Chul Lee's ministry marked a concrete embodiment of practical theology that challenged prevailing paradigms in the Korean Protestant church. From the outset of his pastoral journey, when he planted The Lord’s Church in the auditorium of a high school in Songpa, Seoul, in 1988, he set a countercultural tone by declaring a self-imposed 10-year term limit on his pastoral leadership. True to this promise, he stepped down in 1998, stating that a pastor should be \"not a wage earner, but a person of calling.\" This act, rare in a church culture dominated by life-long appointments and personal control over congregations, symbolized his theological conviction that authority in the church must be bounded, accountable, and sacrificial.\n\nOne of Lee’s most innovative practices was his adoption of expository sequential preaching (순서설교), in which he preached verse by verse through entire books of the Bible, beginning with the Gospel of John. At a time when most Korean churches favored topical and emotionally driven sermons, this method invited congregants to engage deeply with the structure and flow of Scripture. “Even churchgoers who only attend on Sundays will, over time, understand the Bible more holistically,” Lee emphasized, noting that such preaching “allows God’s Word to lead both the preacher and the church.” This method was not merely pedagogical—it was theological: a commitment to the integrity of Scripture as the foundation of the Christian life.\n\nAfter resigning from The Lord’s Church, Lee continued to exercise his theological convictions through writing and speaking. In works like Young Man, Sow Even If You Weep (1998) and Discard the Distorted Gospel (2003), he offered a pointed critique of Korean Christianity’s obsession with prosperity, numerical growth, and institutional power. “The greatest ailments of the Korean church are materialism, prosperity-seeking, and self-centeredness,” he wrote, arguing that such distortions “stand in direct contradiction to the way of Jesus.” His voice gained moral weight because it was not merely prophetic but lived—he had already renounced institutional power and popularity in his own ministry.\n\nIn 2002, Lee was invited to serve as the senior pastor of the Korean Church Centennial Memorial Church (100th Anniversary Memorial Church), a flagship church within the Korean ecumenical tradition. He served there until 2015, when, in another historic move, he appointed four pastors to succeed him as co-pastors. “A church cannot be healthy unless power is shared,” Lee declared. The decision was both theological and structural, designed to resist the monopolization of authority and encourage communal discernment in church leadership. It was the first time in Korean church history that a megachurch transitioned into a collegial pastoral model without conflict.\n\nThrough these actions, Lee demonstrated that pastoral ministry must embody theological convictions at every level—spiritual, ethical, institutional, and relational. In a church culture shaped by hierarchical authority, market-driven expansion, and celebrity leadership, his choices modeled a theology of humility, community, and trust in God’s Word. Lee’s ministry in the 1990s thus stands not merely as a critique of the status quo, but as a working proposal for what the church could become when it truly believes that the Kingdom of God is already among us.\n\n\n김영길  金永吉 Young-gil Kim\n\n10/03/1939 ~ 06/30/2019\n\n\nDr. Young-Gil Kim was a South Korean engineer and educator who founded Handong Global University and served as its first president. His life and achievements represent a rare synthesis of technological expertise and a Christian educational philosophy rooted in moral character and global engagement.\n\nBorn in 1939 in Jiryedong, Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Kim graduated from the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at Seoul National University. He earned a master’s degree in metallurgical engineering from the University of Missouri and a Ph.D. in materials science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in New York. During his years in the United States, he worked as a researcher at NASA’s Lewis Research Center and the International Nickel Company (INCO), where he contributed to the development of high-temperature alloys for jet engines. In 1979, he returned to South Korea to join the faculty of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) as a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, where he devoted himself to scientific advancement and the training of Korea’s next generation of engineers.\n\nIn 1995, Kim established Handong Global University in Pohang, Gyeongbuk, and became its inaugural president. The university, from its inception, aimed to be a Christian institution devoted to holistic education and internationalization. Despite numerous initial challenges—including financial hardship and local resistance—Kim's leadership guided the institution to become one of South Korea's most innovative universities. Notably, Handong was selected in 2007 as a host university for UNESCO’s UNITWIN program and designated in 2011 as a global hub of the United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI) initiative. Kim envisioned Handong as a space for character formation grounded in Christian values. Students were educated to live with honesty, responsibility, and love, and the school emphasized a strong ethical foundation through programs like the honor system and unproctored conscience exams.\n\nKim worked to embody his Christian faith in his educational philosophy. In 1981, he co-founded the Korea Association for Creation Research and served as its first president. Through Handong, he championed values-based education that fostered not only academic achievement but also compassion and service. He famously promoted the motto, “Study to give it away,” encouraging students to become altruistic and mission-oriented leaders.\n\nAs a scientist, Kim left a remarkable legacy. His research on superalloys for jet engines led to NASA awarding him the Tech Briefs Award in both 1976 and 1981. He also received the IR-100 Award for industrial innovation in 1981. After returning to Korea, he led the development of PMC-102, a high-performance alloy for semiconductor lead frames, which became Korea’s first export of high-tech materials to an advanced industrial nation. As an educator and leader, he served in various capacities including president of the Accreditation Board for Engineering Education of Korea (ABEEK), chairman of the Korean Council for University Education, and president of the Korean Association of Private University Presidents, influencing national policy in higher education.\n\n\n\n\n(1) John S. Burdon (Chen Ruiwen 2918; Zhong Renli 1951: 12-16)  \n\n\nJohn S. Burdon (1826–1907), bishop of the Diocese of Victoria of the Anglican Church, was the third bishop of this diocese. Born in Scotland in 1826, he was accepted as a missionary by the Church Missionary Society in 1850 and sent to Shanghai in 1853. In 1862, he served as an instructor at the Tongwen Guan in Beijing and returned to England in 1864 to report on his work. He returned to Beijing in 1865 and participated in Bible translation efforts with other missionaries, publishing a Mandarin version in 1872. He also translated the Book of Common Prayer into Chinese and supported translating \"God\" as \"Tianzhu\" (天主).  \n\n\nIn 1874, he was consecrated as a bishop in England and appointed as Bishop of Victoria by the Archbishop of Canterbury under a Royal Letter of Warrant. He was the first bishop of the Diocese of Victoria not appointed through Letters Patent. This change in appointment method led to debates within the Hong Kong Anglican Church regarding the authority of a bishop appointed by the church rather than the state. The intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Colonial Secretary ultimately confirmed that his episcopal authority was no different from that of his predecessors.  \n\n\nAt that time, the Diocese of Victoria covered parts of China (north of the 28th parallel, which was under the Diocese of North China) and Japan (which became an independent diocese in 1883). During his tenure, Bishop Burdon frequently visited Fujian and Beihai in Guangxi. In Hong Kong, he devoted himself to reorganizing St. Paul's College, emphasizing its role in theological education to train Chinese clergy. Kwong Yat-sau, the first Chinese priest in the Hong Kong Anglican Church, graduated from St. Paul's College and was ordained by Bishop Burdon in 1884.  \n\n\nBishop Burdon also attempted to introduce the translation of \"Tianzhu\" in Hong Kong. An inscription on the outer wall of the Hong Kong Anglican Church Bishop's House reading \"Honor Tianzhu, Love Your Neighbor as Yourself\" is believed to be associated with him. However, the use of this term for \"God\" was not widely accepted among Protestant missionaries, where \"Shangdi\" (上帝) and \"Shen\" (神) remained the mainstream translations. He also explored the idea of incorporating Chinese elements into the Eucharist, suggesting the use of rice cakes and tea instead of bread and wine, but this proposal was also not adopted.  \n\n\nIn 1897, at the age of 70, Bishop Burdon retired. A year after leaving Hong Kong, he returned to Beihai and officially retired to England in 1900. He passed away in 1907 at the age of 81. Over his lifetime, he dedicated 44 years to missionary work, serving as Bishop of Victoria for 24 years.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(2) Thomas W. Pearce (Li Zhigang 2014a: 12-15; Liu Yuesheng 1996: 336-340; Ye Chenming 2014)  \n\n\nThomas W. Pearce (1854–1938), an English pastor, was ordained by the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1879 and arrived in Hong Kong in November of the same year. He initially served in Guangzhou and studied Chinese. In 1893, he was transferred to Hong Kong to assist Rev. John Chalmers, the superintendent of the Hong Kong Missionary District, and served as secretary of the Missionary Committee for South China. After Rev. Chalmers passed away in 1899, Pearce took charge of the LMS’s affairs in Hong Kong. He passed away in England in 1938 at the age of 84.  \n\n\nRev. Pearce made significant contributions to the development of the LMS in Hong Kong. As early as 1889 in Guangzhou, he represented the LMS in negotiating the Agreement with the Chinese Church with the Daoji Church in Hong Kong, defining the relationship between the mission society and the self-governing church. This agreement held historical importance in delineating church-mission relations, especially in resolving disputes.  \n\n\nLater, as the Daoji Church congregation grew, its premises on Hollywood Road became insufficient, prompting discussions on constructing a new church. At the same time, the LMS considered rebuilding the Alice Memorial Hospital. Pearce proposed using the mission's land on Bonham Road for the new church and hospital. The new church was completed in 1926 and named Hop Yat Church, acknowledging fundraising contributions by Chinese Presbyterians from Australia.  \n\n\nRev. Pearce placed great importance on education, believing it aided evangelism. He advocated for church school teachers to be selected from among believers to strengthen church-school ties. After the University of Hong Kong was established in 1911 and Morrison Hall was completed, Pearce served as its warden. Between 1917 and 1919, he also acted as the principal of Ying Wa College.  \n\n\nIn 1895, Pearce initiated prison visitations in Hong Kong to share the Gospel with prisoners, with Daoji Church actively participating in this ministry.  \n\n\nIn 1898, Pearce launched missionary work in Macau, a Portuguese colony with a strong Catholic influence. He urged the LMS to negotiate with the Portuguese government to allow Chinese Christians to establish churches and carry out missionary activities in Macau. After years of effort, Chi Dao Church was established in 1906.  \n\n\nIn 1904, the LMS, Daoji Church, and Union Chapel co-founded the New Territories Missionary Society, with Pearce serving as the council chairman. In 1915, the Hong Kong Christian Council was established, and Pearce, as the advisor of Daoji Church, was elected chairman for its first two terms.  \n\n(1) 包爾騰 John S. Burdon (陳睿文2918；鐘仁立 1951：12-16)\n\n\n包爾騰 （John S. Burdon）主教（1826-1907），聖公會維多利亞教區（Diocese of Victoria）第三任主教，1826年生於蘇格蘭，1850年被英國聖公會海外傳道會（Church Missionary Society）接納為傳教士，1853年派至上海傳教。1862年，出任北京同文館教習，1864年返英述職。1865年回到北京，與其他傳教士開展聖經翻譯工作，1872年出版了官話本譯本。他又將《公禱書》譯為中文，並支持將God譯為「天主」。\n\n\n1874年，他在英國被祝聖為主教，並由坎特伯里大主教藉《皇室許可》（Royal Letter of Warrent）任命為維多利亞教區主教，也是首位並非藉《英皇制誥》（Letters Patent）任命的維多利亞教區主教。由於任命方式的改變，引發了香港聖公會對主教職權的爭論，即一位由教會而非國家任命的主教，其權限是否只涉及傳教事務，而毋關於殖民地教會。最後，經坎特伯里大主教及殖民地秘書介入，確認其主教權限與前兩任主教無異。\n\n\n此時，維多利亞教區的範圍，仍包括中國境內（北緯二十八度以上屬華北教區）及日本（1883年獨立成教區）。包主教任內，多次造訪福建及廣西北海。就香港而言，包爾騰致力重整聖保羅書院，特別重視其神學教育的職能，訓練華人投入傳道工作。其中香港聖公會首位華人牧師鄺日修，便於聖保羅書院畢業，並於1884年由包主教按立為牧師。\n\n\n包爾騰主教亦嘗試將「天主」的譯名引入香港。現存香港聖公會主教府外牆刻有「恭敬天主，愛人如己」之石刻，相信跟他有關。不過，有關「聖號」的譯名在新教傳教士內，主流仍是「上帝」及「神」，包氏的主張始終未獲廣泛認同。同時，他又思考中國元素的聖餐，認為可用年糕和茶取代麵包和葡萄酒。不過，同樣因未獲支持而擱置。\n\n\n1897年，由於年紀老邁，包爾騰以七十高齡退下主教一職。離開香港一年後，重返北海，至1900年退休回國。1907年離世，終年81歲。終其一生，44年投入傳教工作，並任維多利亞教區主教達24年之久。\n\n\n(2) 皮堯士Thomas W. Pearce（李志剛2014a ：12-15；劉粵聲1996：336-340；葉琛銘2014）\n\n\n皮堯士（Thomas W. Pearce）牧師（1854-1938），生於英國，1879年由倫敦傳道會按立為牧師，並於11月抵達香港。他首先在廣州服務，並學習中文。1893年調至香港，協助香港傳道區監督湛約翰（John Chalmers）牧師，並任華南地區傳教委員會秘書。1899年湛牧師離世後，即主理香港倫敦會事務。1938年在英國安息，享年84歲。\n\n\n皮堯士牧師對倫敦會在香港的發展，貢獻良多。早於1889年在廣州時，他便代表倫敦會與香港華人教會（道濟會堂）訂立《與華人教會協議》（Agreement with the Chinese Church），就雙方關係作出界定。道濟會堂是華人自理堂會，如何處理與差會的關係，特別是出現紛爭時的處理，協議在差會－教會關係上，可說具有重要的歷史意義。\n\n\n後來，道濟會堂因信徒增加，荷里活道堂址不敷應用，有覓地建堂之議。當時倫敦會亦有意重建雅麗氏醫院，皮堯士建議將差會在般含道的辦事處地段作為新堂址及院址。1926年，新堂落成，由於當時澳洲長老會華僑對建堂募捐工作亦有承擔，新堂乃命名「合一堂」。\n\n\n皮堯士牧師十分重視教育工作，肯定教育有助宣教。他主張由信徒任教會學校教師，鞏固堂校關係。1911年香港大學成立，馬禮遜館（Morrison Hall）落成後，皮牧擔任舍監。1917至19年間，他又出任英華書院署理校長。\n\n\n1895年，皮堯士開展香港的監獄探訪工作，希望可以將福音傳給囚犯。在他的推動下，道濟會堂亦積極投入。\n\n\n1898年，皮堯士發起澳門的傳道工作。澳門乃葡萄牙殖民地，天主教的影響力較大。皮牧師特別促請倫敦會就澳門建堂一事，與葡國政府交涉，希望其尊重華人基督徒在澳建立教會及傳教的權利。經過數年的耕耘，志道會堂於1906年成立。\n\n\n1904年，倫敦傳道會、道濟會堂及愉寧堂（Union Chapel）成立新界傳道會，皮牧師任值理會主席。1915年，香港基督教聯會成立，皮堯士以道濟會堂顧問牧師參與，獲選為第一及第二屆主席。\n\n\n(3) Wong Yuk Cho (Li Zhigang 2014b: 76-80; Liu Yuesheng 1996: 312-315; Ye Chenming 2014; Liu Shaolin 2003: 153-154)  \n\n\nWong Yuk Cho (1843–1902), courtesy name Bing Yiu, was born in Dongguan, Guangdong, in 1843. His father, Wong Yuen Sum, joined Karl F. Gützlaff's Fu Han Society and later became a missionary with the Rhenish Mission in Hong Kong. Wong Yuk Cho attended the Rhenish Mission School in his youth and graduated from the Rhenish Theological Seminary in 1866. After graduation, he preached in Dongguan and Humen. In 1873, he came to Hong Kong for medical treatment and assisted the Berlin Foundling House. In 1884, he was ordained as a pastor.  \n\n\nIn the 1880s, Chinese believers in the London Missionary Society (LMS) advocated for establishing self-governed churches and actively sought Chinese pastors. In 1885, Wong accepted an invitation from the LMS to become the pastor of its Chinese self-governed church. He led Daoji Church after its establishment in 1888, serving there until his death in 1902. Between 1885 and 1902, Wong made significant contributions to the development of the LMS’s Chinese self-governed churches.  \n\n\nAs Daoji Church was adjacent to Alice Memorial Hospital, both under the LMS, Wong actively promoted hospital evangelism. He also advocated for vocational evangelism, establishing various projects to assist believers in need. These included a plantation on Lantau Island in 1891, a rattan goods factory in Yau Ma Tei in 1893, and a lime and shipyard on Peng Chau in 1894. In 1893, he founded the Yee Sang Industrial Mission to support sick believers. Although these initiatives had limited success, his efforts to integrate charity, industry, and evangelism were pioneering.  \n\n\nWong also engaged in social issues. In 1877, he joined other pastors and believers in Hong Kong to participate in the anti-opium movement, establishing the \"Society for the Suppression of Opium.\" He contributed articles against opium in the Global Times. In 1890, he wrote to the German church about the plight of blind girls in China, leading to the establishment of the Home for the Blind in Hong Kong with support from German Christian women.  \n\n\nIn 1894, during a plague outbreak in Hong Kong, Wong raised concerns about sanitation in the Chinese community and petitioned the Governor for the construction of public baths. After the First Sino-Japanese War, he published Compilation of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, advocating against a peace treaty with Japan. In 1896, he published Phonetic Script, proposing script reform to promote literacy. During the Hundred Days’ Reform in 1898, he wrote a ten-thousand-word petition criticizing China's shortcomings. Following the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, he wrote to Li Hongzhang, urging an end to anti-Christian disputes.  \n\n\nWong's involvement in national affairs brought him into discussions with Sun Yat-sen during the latter's studies in Hong Kong. Sun frequently attended Daoji Church and discussed national issues with Wong, who supported the revolutionary activities of the Xingzhonghui in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nWong Yuk Cho passed away in 1903 due to typhoid fever.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(4) Leong On Tong (Xing Fuzeng 2014: 156-159; Zhou Yifu 1975: 5-6)  \n\n\nLeong On Tong (1827–1913), a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, was born in 1827. In 1857, he moved to Australia to work in gold mining. In 1864, he converted to Christianity in Vaughan and joined the Methodist Church in Castlemaine, near Melbourne. He began preaching in 1866 and was ordained as a pastor in 1876, serving at the Little Bourke Street Church in Melbourne.  \n\n\nAfter retiring in 1885, Leong moved to Hong Kong. At that time, Chinese Methodists in Wellington Street had established Hui Shi Li Gospel Hall, but the South China District lacked pastors or missionaries and could only provide a monthly subsidy of 15 dollars. Seeing the need, Leong stayed in Hong Kong and became the first Chinese pastor of the Methodist Church in Hong Kong. Over ten years, more than 30 people were baptized under his leadership.  \n\n\nDue to financial constraints, Leong initially received a monthly salary of 20 dollars, which was reduced to a travel allowance of 10 dollars after two years. After 1896, he declined any payment altogether. Despite limited resources, Leong was devoted to church affairs. One major challenge was the lack of a suitable and permanent church site, which hindered the church's development. In 1906, with donations from returning overseas Chinese and additional contributions from members, a building was purchased on Aberdeen Street and converted into a church. Within seven years, the number of baptized members grew to 150.  \n\n\nLeong On Tong passed away in April 1913 in Hong Kong at the age of 86. Over 28 years, he laid a solid foundation for the Methodist Church among Chinese believers in Hong Kong despite resource limitations.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(5) Charles R. Hager (Liu Yuesheng 1996: 322-327; Huang Yuhuo 2011: 326-349; Zhang Chengzhen n.d.)  \n\n\nCharles R. Hager (1851–1917), a pastor, was born in Switzerland in 1851. In 1858, he immigrated to the United States with his family. After graduating from the Pacific Theological Seminary in 1882, he was ordained as a pastor by the Congregational Church and commissioned by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to serve in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nThe Congregational Church first sent missionaries to Hong Kong in 1843, but by 1845, they shifted their focus to Guangzhou. Due to limited success, the mission in Guangdong ended in 1867, and resources were redirected to Fujian and northern China. In the 1880s, Congregational missionaries returned to Hong Kong at the request and support of Chinese Christians in San Francisco who wanted to bring the Gospel to their hometowns in Guangdong.  \n\n\nAfter arriving in Hong Kong in March 1883, Hager rented a house on Bridges Street in Central, which served as a base for missionary work in inland Guangdong and a hostel for Chinese Christians traveling between the U.S. and Guangdong. The three-story building housed missionary quarters, a guesthouse, and the \"American Chinese Bookstore,\" where Chinese children were taught English.  \n\n\nIn May 1884, Hager baptized Sun Yat-sen, who was then a student at the Central School in Hong Kong. Using Hong Kong as his base, Hager studied Chinese and conducted missionary tours in the Siyi region, establishing mission stations in Xin Ning, Mu Ping, Guang Hai, and Hui An. In 1891, health issues forced him to temporarily return to the U.S., where he received medical training. He returned to China in 1894 with his new wife.  \n\n\nAfter his wife passed away in Guangzhou in 1895, Hager returned to Hong Kong, where he rented a house for a chapel. As the congregation grew, funds were raised to purchase land on Ladder Street, and a church was built in 1901, named \"Chinese Self-Supporting Church at Ladder Street.\"  \n\n\nIn 1910, health problems compelled Hager to retire from missionary work and return to the U.S. He passed away in California in July 1917 at the age of 66.  \n\n\nHager's 27 years of missionary service in Hong Kong and Guangdong included the establishment of over 40 churches and 29 schools, making him a pioneer of Congregational missions in Hong Kong and South China.  \n\n(3) 王煜初 Wong Yuk Cho（李志剛2014 b：76-80；劉粵聲1996：312-315；葉琛銘2014；劉紹麟2003：153-154）\n\n\n王煜初（1843-1902）牧師，字炳耀，1843年生於廣東東莞。父親王元深，早年加入郭實獵（郭士立）（Karl F. Gützlaff）福漢會，後成為香港禮賢會傳道。王煜初少時入讀禮賢書館，1866年於禮賢神道學堂畢業後，先後於東莞、虎門傳道。1873年來香港養病，並協助巴陵會育嬰堂（Berlin Founding House），1884年牧立為牧師。\n\n\n1880年代，倫敦會華人信徒倡議成立自理教會，並積極延聘華人牧師。1885年，王煜初接受倫敦會邀請，轉職任倫敦會華人自理會會牧。1888年，道濟會堂建立，王牧師主理教會，至1902年離世。自1885至1902年間，王煜初對倫敦會華人自理教會的發展，可說貢獻良多。\n\n\n由於道濟會堂與毗鄰雅麗氏利濟醫院同屬倫敦會，王牧師積極推動醫院佈道。同時，他又倡議實業佈道，於1891年成立裁植畜牧公取，於大嶼山購地建種植場，為有需要會友提供就業機會。1893年，又在油麻地設廣道堂藤業公司，收容貧苦教友織造藤具。1894年，在坪洲成立燒製石灰及造船工場。1893年，成立毅生工業使團，設廠房收容病患者。上述實業佈道事工成效並不理想，但王煜初牧師嘗試將慈善、實業與佈道結合的嘗試，在當時確具開創性。\n\n\n王煜初亦積極關注社會事務。早於1877年，他聯同其他香港牧者及信徒投入反鴉片運動，成立「勸戒鴉片會社」，又投稿《萬國公報》，發表反鴉片文章。1890年，他向德國教會撰文，希望其關注中國失明女童苦況，並在德國基督徒婦女捐助下，在港成立心光盲人院。1894年，香港爆發鼠疫，華人社區衛生情況備受關注。他曾上書港督，建議增建公眾浴室。中日甲午戰爭後，他在香港出版《中日甲午戰輯，附諫止中東和議奏疏冤海述聞》。1896年，他出版《拚音文字譜》，倡議文字改革，期望藉併音文字促成智識普及。1898年，戊戍變法期間，他撰寫萬言書，痛陳中國積弊。1900年義和團亂後，他上書李鴻章，希望可平息反教爭端。由於王煜初對國事的關注，孫中山在港求學期間，常參與道濟會堂聚會，並與王牧師商討國是。對於興中會在港策劃革命運動，王煜初亦予以支持。\n\n\n1903年，王煜初因傷寒病逝。\n\n\n(4) 梁安統 Leong On Tong（邢福增2014：156-159；周億孚1975：5-6）\n\n\n梁安統（1827-1913），廣東新會人。1827年出生，1857年赴澳洲從事金礦開採工作。1864年於Vaughan接受基督教，參加維多利亞州府城墨爾本附近金礦區卡索曼（Castlemaine）衛理公會。1866年起傳道，1876年按立為牧師，負責墨爾本Little Bourke Street教會。\n\n\n1885年退休後抵香港。當時有循道公會華人信徒在香港島威靈頓街設惠師禮福音堂，但華南教區卻無法調派牧者或傳教士來港，只能提供每月15元津貼。梁安統抵港後見群羊乏牧，答允留港，成為香港華人循道會第一位牧師。經過十年努力，加入教會受洗者有30餘人。\n\n\n由於資源緊絀，梁安統最初每月僅領薪金20元，兩年後更轉為頤養牧師，接受車馬費10元。1896年後更分文不受。其對教務盡心盡力。期間，教會面對最大的困難，在於缺乏合適及固定堂址。後來多次遷徙，對教會的發展構成阻力。1906年，在美洲歸僑捐助下，加上會友餘資，終於鴨巴甸街購一屋宇，修為教堂。七年間，受洗人數增至150人。\n\n\n1913年4月，梁安統在香港安息。享年86歲。他帶領香港華人循道會凡廿八年，在資源匱乏下，為循道公會在香港的華人教會，奠下重要基礎。\n\n\n(5) 喜嘉理 Charles R. Hager（劉粵聲1996：322-327；黃宇和2011：326-349；張成珍 n.d.）\n\n\n喜嘉理（Charles R. Hager, 1851-1917）牧師，1851年生於瑞士。1858年，隨父母移民美國。1882年畢業於加洲太平洋神學院（Pacific Theological Seminary），翌年被公理會（Congregational Church）按立為牧師，並接受公理會海外傳道會（American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions）差派來到香港。\n\n\n公理會傳教士最早於1843年抵港，但到1845年便決定北上廣州。惟因在粵事工並不理想，於1867年結束，將資源集中於福州及華北一帶。1880年代公理會再次派傳教士到香港，緣於一群旅居三藩市的綱紀慎會華人信徒的籲請及支持，希望將福音傳至廣東四邑家鄉。1883年3月，喜嘉理抵港後，即在中環必列者士街租房，既作為進入內地傳教的基地，又可接待出國或回鄉的四邑鄉親教友。\n\n\n必列者士街會址樓高三層，頂樓為傳教士宿舍，二樓為為接待宿舍，地下設「美華書館」，用作教授華童英語。1884年5月，喜嘉理為孫中山主持洗禮，當時孫中山正於香港中央書院就讀。喜嘉理以香港為據點，學習中文，同時又到內陸四邑一帶巡迴傳教，先後於新甯、繆平、廣海、會安等地設宣教基址。1891年，喜嘉理因身體健康關係，暫時離開香港，回到美國休養，並完成醫學訓練，至1894年偕同新婚妻子再度來華。\n\n\n1895年3月，喜嘉理夫人在廣州病逝後，他重返香港，租屋設福音堂。隨著人數增加，1898年在會眾集資購地於樓梯街建堂，1901年落成，名「美華自理會樓梯街堂」。1910年，喜嘉理因健康問題。不得不結束海外宣教工作，回到美國。1917年7月在加洲病逝，享年66歲。\n\n\n總計喜嘉理來華宣教前後凡27年，在香港及廣東一帶，建立40多處教會，並辦校29所。可說是香港及華南公理會傳教的先驅。\n\n\n\n**(1) Joseph C.

Hoare (霍約瑟, 1851–1906)**  \n\n\nJoseph C. Hoare was the fourth bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Victoria (1898–1906). Born in 1851, he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was ordained into the clergy. Sent by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) to China, Hoare established Trinity Theological School in Ningbo, Zhejiang, where he served as principal. During his 20 years in Ningbo, he became proficient in the Ningbo dialect and developed a unique educational model, \"evangelical theory through ambulando\" (\"learning theology through missionary practice\"). This method emphasized hands-on training, with Hoare personally leading students on preaching journeys to remote villages. These missions often lasted up to ten weeks, blending demonstration and instruction. Under his leadership, Trinity Theological School trained dozens of Chinese missionaries, becoming a premier institution in the region.  \n\n\nOn June 11, 1898, Hoare was consecrated as the Bishop of Victoria at St. Paul's Cathedral in London and was posted to Hong Kong.  \n\n\nIn 1901, Hoare reorganized St. Paul’s College into a theological seminary focused on training Chinese clergy. He reached an agreement with the CMS, whereby the bishop directly managed the teaching while the CMS provided additional staff and resources. During his tenure, the Chinese Anglican community in Hong Kong expanded, adding Holy Trinity Church and All Saints' Church alongside St. Stephen’s Church. Hoare also established the Chinese Anglican Church Body in 1902, which was incorporated as a legal entity under his leadership as chairman.  \n\n\nIn September 1906, Hoare led four theology students from St. Paul’s College (Ho Dao-pei, Cheng Yung-chi, Leung Kam-po, and Wong Ting-sang) on a missionary trip to Castle Peak by sea. On their return journey on September 18, they encountered the “Bingwu Typhoon,” which capsized their boat. Both Hoare and the students perished, and their bodies were never recovered. Only Hoare’s prayer book was found, opened to Psalm 23:4:  \n\n*\"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\"*  \n\n\nOn September 30, 1906, memorial services for Hoare were held simultaneously at St. John’s Cathedral in Hong Kong and Holy Trinity Cathedral in Shanghai. A commemorative stone was later placed in the Anglican Bishop’s House in Hong Kong in honor of Bishop Hoare.  \n\n霍約瑟（Joseph C. Hoare, 1851-1906），聖公會維多利亞教區第四任主教(1898-1906)，生於1851年，於劍橋大學三一學院畢業後，按立為聖品。由聖公會海外傳道會派到中國，在浙江寧波籌建三一神道學校，並任校長。在寧波二十餘年間，霍約瑟學懂寧波話，並習得自身獨特的敎育模式：「evangelical theory through ambulando」（「修行佈道習神學」），主要圍繞出外鍛煉。霍約瑟曾親自帶領學徒到各偏僻村莊佈道，除了自身示範之餘又向學徒說敎，佈道團每次遠行可長達十週。三一書院在霍約瑟帶領期間，成功培育數十名華人傳敎士，於眾多地區中首屈一指。1898年6月11日，他在倫敦聖保羅座堂被祝聖為維多利亞教區主教，派駐香港。\n\n\n1901年，霍約瑟將聖保羅書院改組，重新轉型為神學院，旨在培訓華人神職人員。他與英國海外傳道會達成協議，敎學由主教親自管理，海外傳道會則提供額外人手及資源援助。在霍約瑟任內，香港聖公會華人牧區亦有所增加，除聖士提反堂外，亦有聖三一堂及諸聖堂。霍約瑟乃組織香港區議會（The Chinese Anglican Church Body），於1902年向政府立案為法人。區議會由教區主教任主席。\n\n\n1906年9月，霍約瑟帶領4位聖保羅書院神學生（賀道培、鄭容枝、梁芹波、王挺生）循海路到青山佈道，在9月18日回程時遇上「丙午風災」，主教及四位學生因翻船罹難，搜索遺體不獲，只找到主教使用的一本祈禱書，剛好翻開《詩篇》23篇第4節一頁：「我雖然行過死蔭的幽谷，也不怕遭害，因為你與我同在；你的杖，你的竿，都安慰我。」1906年9月30日，香港聖約翰座堂及上海聖三一座堂同日為霍約瑟舉行追思禮拜。在聖公會主教府內，亦置一紀念霍約瑟主教的碑石。\n\n\n**(2) Gerald H.

He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was ordained as a priest in 1885. In 1904, he became a pastor at Liverpool Cathedral, and in 1907, he was consecrated as bishop, succeeding Bishop Joseph C. Hoare, who had perished in the \"Bingwu Typhoon.\"  \n\n\nThe Church Missionary Society (CMS) sought to revive St. Paul’s College to provide Western-style education for Chinese students. They proposed relocating the existing seminary to China to attract more funding and students. In 1909, St. Paul’s College reopened under its original model, with the CMS taking full control of academic affairs. The bishop’s role became akin to that of a present-day school supervisor.  \n\n\nBeyond the college, Lander witnessed rapid growth in the Anglican Church in Hong Kong. In 1912, the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui (the Chinese Anglican Church) was established as an independent province separate from the Church of England. In 1915, St. Paul’s Girls’ College (now St. Paul’s Co-educational College) was founded. During the 1910s, both Diocesan Boys’ School and Diocesan Girls’ School acquired their current campuses, while St. Paul’s College itself expanded its facilities, doubling its enrollment capacity.  \n\n倫義華（Gerald H. Lander, 1861-1934）主教，聖公會維多利亞教區第五任主教（1907-1920），畢業於劍橋大學三一神學院，1885年按立為牧師。1904年任利物浦座堂牧師，1907年祝聖為主教，接替因「丙午風災」罹難的霍約瑟主教。\n\n\n英國海外傳道會計劃恢復聖保羅書院爲華人提供西式敎育，認爲將現有神學院遷往中國能有助募資收生。1909年，聖保羅書院以舊有模式重開，敎學方面由英國海外傳道會全面接管，會督的角色則與現今之校監相似。\n\n\n書院以外，倫義華見證敎會於香港急速成長：1912年中華聖公會創立，後成爲自身敎省，獨立於英格蘭敎會；聖保羅女書院（今聖保羅男女中學）於1915年創立；1910年代，拔萃女書院與男書院雙雙購獲現有校址，而聖保羅書院本身亦於同期擴建校園，收生量倍增。\n\n\n**(3) Matthew A-Jet (鄺日修)**  \n\n(Source: Xing Fuzeng, 2014a: 108–112; Chung Yan Lap, 1975: 7–11; Zhong Hua Xu Xing Wei Ban Hui, 1921: 269)  \n\n(3) 鄺日修 Matthew A-Jet（邢福增2014a：108-112；鍾仁立1975: 7-11；中華續行委辦會1921：269）\n\n\n**Matthew A-Jet (鄺日修, 1840–1921)**  \n\n\nMatthew A-Jet, a pastor, was born on September 3, 1840, in Shiliantang Village, Sanjia Market, Taishan County. In his early years, he worked at mines in Australia, where he became a Christian in Sydney in 1868 and later became a preacher. He returned to China in 1874 and joined Anglican missionaries on itinerant preaching tours in Zengcheng and Beihai. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he expressed his calling to Bishop John S. Burdon of the Anglican Church and enrolled in the theological program at St. Paul’s College. At the time, the London Missionary Society (LMS) in Hong Kong lacked Chinese preachers. Upon A-Jet’s graduation, the LMS borrowed him from the Anglican Church to serve as a missionary. LMS missionaries E. J. Eitel and John Chalmers held A-Jet in high regard.  \n\n\nAfter serving as an LMS missionary for seven years, A-Jet joined the Anglican Church in 1883. On July 8, 1883, he was ordained as a deacon, becoming the second Chinese cleric ordained by the Anglican Church in Hong Kong. On March 9, 1884, he was ordained as a pastor and succeeded Luo Xin Yuan, who had retired, in leading the ministry of St. Stephen’s Church. After moving to Kowloon in 1902, A-Jet became deeply involved in church work, actively promoting missionary and charitable efforts in Kowloon City and nearby areas. He made significant contributions to the establishment of the Holy Trinity Church parish.  \n\n\nWhile serving at Holy Trinity Church, A-Jet founded the Almshouse in 1902 to aid the poor, sick, and elderly. He later expanded it to include the Tian Guo Rescue Chapel. In 1903, he joined other Chinese pastors from the LMS and Baptist Church in petitioning the Hong Kong government to allocate land in Kowloon for a Chinese Christian cemetery. The government approved the request in 1904, creating the first Chinese Christian cemetery in Kowloon. In 1906, A-Jet established St. Paul’s Primary School (later renamed Tian Guo Primary School) in Kowloon Walled City to provide education for impoverished youth, teaching general subjects and vocational skills.  \n\n\nA-Jet also valued literary work and authored several books, including *True Doctrine Clarified*, *Discerning Right from Wrong*, and *Paths of Heaven*. He passed away on January 20, 1921, at the age of 81.  \n\n鄺日修（Matthew A-Jet, 1840 -1921）牧師，祖籍台山縣三夾墟石蓮塘村，生於1840年9月3日。鄺日修早年遠赴澳洲礦場工作，1868年間在悉梨信主，後任傳道。1874年回國，曾隨同聖公會傳教士於增城、北海等地巡迴佈道。到香港後，向當時聖公會的包爾騰主教（John S. Burdon）陳述心志，進入聖保羅書院神道班學道。當時香港倫敦會因缺乏華人傳道，適逢鄺氏畢業，乃向聖公會商借聘請他為宣教師。兩位主理倫敦會在港事務的傳教士歐德理（E. J. Eitel）及湛約翰（John Chalmers）對鄺日修評價甚高。\n\n\n鄺日修在倫敦會任宣教師七年後，於1883年加入聖公會任宣教師。1883年7月8日被按立為會吏，是聖公會在港按立的第二位華人聖品人員。1884年3月9日再被按立為牧師，接替當時已經年邁的羅心源，主理聖士提反堂的事工。鄺日修於1902年遷居九龍後，積極參與教會事工，大力推動九龍城及附近地區的宣教及慈惠事業，對聖三一堂牧區的建立，貢獻重大。\n\n\n在聖三一堂事奉時，鄺日修牧師於1902年開辦了廣蔭院（Almshouse），以服務貧苦、病疾及無助老人為宗旨。後來增設天國救道堂。1903年，鄺日修聯同其他倫敦會、浸信會華人牧者聯名上書香港政府，希望在九龍撥地建華人基督教墳場。1904年政府批地，成為九龍首個華人基督教墳場。1906年，他在九龍寨城建聖保羅小學（後易名天國小學），專收容貧苦少年，教授普通科及工藝知識。\n\n\n鄺日修亦重視文字工作，著有《真道明辨》、《辨別邪正》及《天道分流》等著作。鄺牧師於1921年1月20日安息，享年81歲。\n\n\n**(4) Wong Anang (王謙如)**  \n\n(Source: Li Zhigang, 2014: 133–136; Zhang Zhiwei, 2005: 143–180)  \n\n(4) 王謙如 Wong Anang（李志剛2014：133-136；張志偉2005：143-180）\n\n\n**Wong Anang (1847–1907)**  \n\n\nWong Anang, born in Hong Kong in 1847, hailed from Dongguan, Guangdong. His father, Wong Yuan-shen, was the first preacher of the Rhenish Mission, and his elder brother was Wong Yuk-chu. As a young man, Wong graduated from the Rhenish Mission School and aspired to become a preacher. He studied theology under Ferdinand Genahr and Adam Jrolczyk. Wong graduated from the missionary school in 1866 and was ordained as a pastor in Yongfu in 1884. Over the years, he established churches in nearly ten locations, including:  \n\n\n- 1877: Sun Wai Church  \n\n- 1879: Fuyong, Dongguan, Xin'an  \n\n- 1881: Shijia Village  \n\n- 1886: Dongguan  \n\n- 1895: Kaijingbei Church  \n\n- 1896: Tangxia Yeshan  \n\n- 1897: Taiping  \n\n- 1898: Hong Kong  \n\n- 1902: Shiqi  \n\n- 1906: Daliang Dalang  \n\n\nWong made significant contributions to the early missionary efforts of the Rhenish Mission.  \n\n\nIn 1898, while recuperating in Hong Kong, Wong noticed that many believers from Dongguan and Bao’an had moved to Hong Kong, congregating in the Sai Ying Pun area. He used a missionary's residence on Bonham Road West as a venue for Sunday sermons. After recovering, he returned to preach in Xiangshan, Shiqi, Daliang, and Xiaolan. In 1906, he settled in Hong Kong and participated in the planning and construction of the Rhenish Mission Church. Wong passed away in October 1907 at the age of 61. The church building was completed in 1911, laying the foundation for the Rhenish Mission’s development in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nBeyond preaching, Wong deeply reflected on the relationship between Christianity and Chinese culture. He moved beyond the \"Accommodation Theory\" and \"Supplementary Theory,\" striving to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity in all aspects over Confucianism—a perspective he called the \"Transcendence Theory.\" He argued that Christianity was incomparable to Confucianism and firmly believed that Christian faith could lead to national prosperity and strength. Wong contributed articles to *The Church News* and *A Review of the Times*. In his later years, he authored works such as *Christian and Confucian Monthly Commentary* and *The Measure of Three Religions*.  \n\n\n王謙如（1847-1907），廣東東莞人，1847年生於香港，父親是禮賢會首位傳道王元深，兄長王煜初。少年在禮賢會學堂畢業，後立志傳道，隨葉納清（Ferdinand Genahr）及公孫惠（Adam Jrolczyk）習神科。1866年傳教學校畢業，1884年於永福受按立為牧師。先後於近十處地方建立教會（1877年：新圍聖會； 1879年：福永、東莞、新安；1881年：石家村；1886年：東莞；1895 年：開逕背聖會；1896年：塘廈耶山；1897年：太平；1898年：香港；1902年：石歧；1906年：大良大欖） ，對禮賢會早期傳道事工，作出重大貢獻。\n\n\n1898年寓港養病期間，見東莞、寶安信徒來港謀生者眾，聚居西營盤一帶，乃在般含道西教士養病住所洋房開房，作主日講道之所。王謙如康復後，回到香山、石歧、大良、小欖等地佈道。1906年來香港定居後，參與禮賢會堂的籌建。1907年10月離世，亨年61歲。1911年，禮賢會堂落成，為該會在香港發展，奠下根基。\n\n\n除傳道外，王謙如對基督教與中國文化關係，亦多有省思，他在「合儒論」與「補儒論」外，更力圖闡明基督教各在各方面均優於勝家，儒家不能與基督教比擬（超儒論）。不僅如此，他更深信，基督教信仰有助國家富強。曾於《教會新報》及《萬國公報》刊文，晚年著作有《耶儒月旦》、《三教度鍼》等。\n\n\n**(5) Anna M.

His father, Mok Wai Kam, was involved in promoting the self-reliance of To Tsai Church. Mok graduated from Queen's College and worked as a civil servant, serving as a clerk at the Observatory, a police interpreter, and the chief translator for the Chinese Secretariat. He was originally a deacon and Sunday school principal at the American Congregational Church. Additionally, he founded Lok Kwan School, where he taught English to over 100 students.  \n\n\nIn 1907, Mok was hired as an interpreter for Alfred G. Garr. On November 10, 1907, he became the second individual to receive Spirit Baptism, making him a pioneer and founding figure of the Pentecostal movement in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nThe church was initially named the \"Apostolic Faith Church\" but was renamed the \"Hong Kong Pentecostal Mission\" in 1910. In 1908, Mok launched the first Chinese Pentecostal publication, *The Pentecostal Truth*, introducing Pentecostal beliefs in Chinese for the first time. He also established the Hong Kong Pentecostal Mission as a self-reliant Chinese church, playing a critical role in its growth and development.  \n\n莫禮智（1867–1926），廣東新安人，生於基督教家庭，父親莫惠錦曾庭曾參與推動道濟會堂的自立。畢業於皇仁書院，任職政府公務員（天文台書記、警屬通譯、華民政務司總翻譯）。原為美華自理會執事及主日學校長。開設樂群書塾，教授英文，學生多達百人。1907年，因受聘為嘉活力（Alfred G.

In 1901, after the completion of the new church building, disputes arose between Chinese members and the missionary society over property rights. Dissatisfied with how the issue was handled, Sung left the church.  \n\n\nIn 1907, when the Pentecostal movement reached Hong Kong, Pastor A. G. Garr and his wife arrived and borrowed the American Congregational Church on Ladder Street for meetings. They emphasized teachings on repentance, forgiveness, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Sung, who accompanied his wife to these gatherings, experienced a renewed infilling of the Holy Spirit and became the third believer to receive Spirit Baptism (on November 15, 1907). However, opponents accused the group of heresy and prohibited others from attending their services. In response, Garr, Mok Lai Chi, and Sung Teng Man co-founded the Pentecostal Mission (initially named the Apostolic Faith Church).  \n\n\nAfter Mok Lai Chi passed away in 1926, Sung became the leader of the church. In 1939, following his retirement from a senior civil service position, he was ordained as a pastor. Sung guided the church through the three years and eight months of Japanese occupation during World War II. He passed away in 1958.  \n\n\nFollowing his death, the Kowloon branch of the Pentecostal Mission experienced a split, leading some members to establish the \"Kowloon Pentecostal Church.\" A legal battle over property rights ensued.  \n\n宋鼎文（1883-1958），第二代基督徒，幼年於廣州受洗，後來港參加美華自理會。1901年，美華自理會新堂落成後，未幾華人與差會就產權問題出現爭執，宋不滿差會處理而離開教會。1907年，五旬節運動傳入香港時，嘉活力（A.

Alongside teaching, he assisted with missionary work at St. Stephen’s Church.  \n\n\nIn 1902, when Pastor Matthew A-Jet (鄺日修) relocated to Kowloon to oversee the ministry at Holy Trinity Church, the need for a parish rector became urgent. At that time, Pastor A-Jet was managing both St. Stephen’s Church and Holy Trinity Church. In 1903, Fok was ordained as a deacon and became a pastor the following year, succeeding Matthew A-Jet as the rector of St. Stephen’s Church. During his tenure, Fok established a parish council to promote church autonomy and encouraged congregants to contribute financially to achieve self-sufficiency.  \n\n\nFok also established a women’s Bible school within the church to train female evangelists. Beyond St. Stephen’s Church, he managed All Saints’ Church in Yau Ma Tei and the newly established St. Paul’s Church. He also founded the Joint Parish Council, where he served as vice-chairman. Fok dedicated 50 years of his life to church service.  \n\n\nFok Ching Shan passed away in March 1918 at the age of 67.

Graves）門下學道。1899年，他應聘到香港，任《中國郇報》撰述員，這是數名基督徒出版的週報，主編廖卓庵是張認識多年的朋友。張文開一生從事文字工作，即由此開始。不過，他只在香港生活半年便離開，原因是在港半年目睹外國人欺壓國人的態度，對西教士亦起疑心，一度脫離教會（「無會的信徒」）。\n\n\n1905年，張文開在廣州再遇廖卓庵，此時廖已在美華浸會書局出版的《真光報》（創刊於1902）任筆政，在廖邀請他，張正式加入《真光報》（1917年改名《真光雜誌》工作。《真光》成為張文開文字佈道的平台，前後在此服務達25年之久。期間他曾兩度離職來港，先是1915年春辭去職務後，到香港為聖士提反女校教習尹淑貞講授中國文學，並在1916年與尹文楷（尹淑貞父）組織談天報社，創辦《談天週刊》。繼《談天》後，他計劃創辦《大光週刊》。正當籌備工作進行之際，香港孔教會的《國是報》，在1917年2月8日刊文，力倡立孔教為國教之餘，又批判基督教。香港教會中人希望張亦鏡能撰文駁斥，刊於《大光報》上。張亦鏡連接撰文駁斥《國是報》，展開近一個多月（至3月14日止）的筆戰。有關文章，後再刊於《大光週刊》，最後刊輯成《大光破暗集》，由大光報社出版。\n\n\n1918年3月下旬，筆戰結束，因廣州美華書局書報經理力邀關係，張亦鏡在1918年離港到汕頭復任《真光報》主筆。《大光週刊》既缺主編，乃於1918年月停刊。及至1925年五卅慘案後，張氏因不滿部分西教士對慘案的立場，決定辭職。\n\n\n適時《大光報》董事會主席王國璇希望能由基督徒擔任編輯一職，故力邀張氏再次來港主持報務。後張亦鏡建議另出一週刊作宗教專號，將宗教文章轉刊於此，逢週六出版，命名為《大光日曜》，第一期於1926年2月28日出版。為專注宗教專刊的編務，張亦鏡轉任《大光報》名譽編輯。\n\n\n不過，1926年11月28日出版的《大光日曜》的〈編者言〉中，宣佈了張亦鏡離職的安排。考查張氏離開原因，據其後來自述，是因為他得悉有「某派黨人來收買港中某某等報，大光報亦在彼運動中」。為了不涉入政治黨派之爭，他乃於1926年3月中旬上書堅決請辭。當時張祝齡以董事局書記及編輯部監督身分致函挽留，惜張去意已決。未幾浸信會方面得悉他請辭消息，乃力邀其回巢美華書局，並授予全權主理《真光》。張亦鏡於1926年5月離港，其在香港短短數月的編輯生涯，正式畫上句號。張文開是基督教的辯道士，就祭祖、儒學、孔教、新思潮及無神論反教等課題，以文字衛道。1931年12月，因病離世。\n\n\n(6) 蘇佩球 So Pui Kow（邢福增1914b：23-25）\n\n\n蘇佩球（1868-1951），1868年出生於基督教家庭。早歲來港，是1882年11位致函循道會華南教區的寓港會友之一，由是促成香港華人循道會的開基。後於循道會華南教區廣州增沙聖道書院畢業。1903年前往溫哥華宣教，在海外服務10年後回廣州，任高第堂宣教師。1915年獲華南教區調派來港聯區，接替1913年離世的梁安統牧師。主理教會期間，積極推動佈道、勉勵會、少年部、播道部、詩班及主日學等事工。隨著會務增長，地方不敷應用，啟動籌款建堂事宜。1916年在堅道購地建堂。1921年，堅道堂成立童軍第八旅，是香港首個華人教會成立的童軍，並與主日學有緊密聯繫。1919年受華南教區按立為牧師，同年當選香港基督教聯會主席。1921年調往佛山聯區，1926年移居北美，曾於西雅圖華人教會任牧師。1951年於香港安息。\n\n\n(7) 李求恩 Lee Kau Yan（黃文江2014：26-30；黃國仁：1964）\n\n\n李求恩（1882-1962），廣東香山人，13歲赴檀香山讀書，並於當地美國聖公會聖以利沙伯堂受洗。1911年，李回國入讀廣州聖三一神學院（協和神學院前身）。1914年獲封會吏，翌年被按立為牧師，於香山石岐聖公會服事。1917年，調派至香港，先後於聖三一堂、聖士提反堂、聖馬利亞堂及諸聖堂牧養。在聖三一堂服事期間，他將聖公會在九龍寨城的學校易名「天國學校」，栽培貧苦失學的少年人，除知識傳授外，又有營生手藝。 1924年，以香港教區名義出版《靈鐸週刊》，每週一期，主要是香港聖公會各堂會務近況，同時也刊載香港其他組織（如基督教聯會、青年會、南華聖書會等）及內地聖公會及其他組織（全國基督教協進會）的消息。後來也有一些宗教性的論述文章。1946年，封會吏長。自1920至1960年間，歷任香港基督教聯會主席前後達33年（十一屆），為聯會主序任期最長者。在教育方面，他也不遺餘力，曾創辦漁民學校及徒置區聖紀文學校（天台學校）。1962年6月息勞離世。\n\n\n(8) 曾紀岳 Tsang Kei-Ngok（黃彩蓮2024：130-132）\n\n\n曾紀岳（1890-1980），1890年生於廣東北海，年輕時受教於北海聖公會傳道會傳教士布蘭奇（Charles I.

Initially, he ministered in Hunan and later taught at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Hubei. In 1905, during a visit to a major Buddhist monastery on Mount Weishan, he envisioned a reformation of Western missionary methods and a new mission strategy for evangelizing Buddhists. In 1921, he founded the Christian Mission to Buddhists in China (CMB) to foster dialogue between Christianity and Buddhism.\n\nIn 1922, Reichelt established the Jingfengshan Christian Monastery in Nanjing. Between 1922 and 1927, the monastery hosted 5,000 Buddhist monks, 50 of whom converted to Christianity. However, during the Northern Expedition in 1927, anti-foreign sentiment led to the destruction of Jingfengshan. Reichelt temporarily relocated to Hangzhou and established the Tianfengshan Monastery but eventually decided to leave China.\n\nIn 1929, Reichelt moved to Hong Kong, and in 1930, he purchased a site in Sha Tin, naming it Tao Fong Shan (Mountain of the Christ Wind). He invited Danish architect Johannes Prip-Møller to design the monastery buildings in the style of Chinese Buddhist temples. By 1932, a series of buildings with distinct Chinese characteristics were completed, and missionary work targeting Buddhist monks gradually began at Tao Fong Shan.\n\nReichelt maintained a close relationship with Bishop Ronald O. Hall of the Anglican Church in Hong Kong. Bishop Hall admired the tranquil environment of Tao Fong Shan and chose to reside in the Ling Yim Terrace on the mountain rather than the Central District bishop’s residence. In 1934, Hall presided over the dedication ceremony of the Jingzun Treasure Hall.\n\nTao Fong Shan placed great emphasis on literary missionary work, using publications to promote its vision. In 1934, it launched the journal Tao Fong, publishing two issues annually. The journal ceased publication during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong but resumed in 1948. The journal primarily explored theological perspectives on the relationship between Christianity and other religions and included records of lectures aligned with the monastery’s mission.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Hubei decided to relocate to Hong Kong. Classes resumed at Tao Fong Shan in December 1948, with Reichelt assisting in teaching. He passed away in March 1952 in Hong Kong and was buried in the Christian Monastery Cemetery at Tao Fong Shan. Reichelt’s notable works include Introduction to Religion (1931), The Transformed Abbot (1954, 1959), Truth and Tradition in Chinese Buddhism: A Study of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism (1934), Religion in Chinese Garment (1951), and Meditation and Piety in the Far East: A Religious-Psychological Study (1953).\n\n\n(2) Ronald O. Hall (Paton 1985; Chan-Yeung 2015; 吴青 2017)\n\nRonald O. Hall (1895–1975) served as the seventh bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Victoria (1932–1966). A native of Newcastle, England, Hall graduated from Oxford University in 1920 and was ordained as a curate. He later served as pastor at St. John’s Church in Lambeth. In 1922, Hall first visited China to attend the World Christian Student Federation annual meeting in Beijing.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1926, Hall worked as a secretary for the YMCA in Shanghai, where he met Gu Ziren, a leader of the Christian student movement. Gu gave Hall the Chinese name \"Ho Ming Wah,\" meaning \"light to China,\" reflecting Hall's mission. In 1927, Hall returned to England and served as rector of St. Luke’s Church in Newcastle.\n\nIn 1932, Hall was elected Bishop of Victoria. He was consecrated at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London in October and assumed his position in Hong Kong in December. In 1933, during the 12th Synod of the Diocese of Victoria held in Guangzhou, Hall advocated for appointing a Chinese assistant bishop to promote church autonomy. He also proposed that future church buildings adopt traditional Chinese architectural styles. In 1934, at St. John’s Cathedral in Hong Kong, Hall consecrated Mok Sau Tseng as the first Chinese assistant bishop of South China. Under Hall’s leadership, two new churches were constructed in the 1930s—Holy Trinity Church and St. Mary’s Church—both designed in Chinese styles.\n\nAfter World War II, Hall was instrumental in establishing several social welfare organizations, including the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, the Hong Kong Children’s Reception Centre, St. James’ Settlement, the Hong Kong Family Welfare Society, the Boy Scouts, and the Hong Kong Housing Society. He also led the Anglican Church’s efforts to address the shortage of school places by establishing 19 primary schools and 8 secondary schools between 1950 and 1966, as well as founding vocational training schools. Hall played a key role in the establishment of Chung Chi College, which later became part of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nHall’s tenure lasted 34 years, spanning the significant transition of 1949 when the People’s Republic of China was established. During this time, Hall reorganized the diocese, transforming the Diocese of Victoria and Canton into the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau. His term also saw controversies, such as the ordination of the first female Anglican priest, Li Tim Oi, and his 1956 visit to China.\n\nHall received two honorary medals from the Nationalist Government and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1965, the University of Hong Kong awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in recognition of his contributions to Hong Kong society.\n\nHall retired in 1966 and passed away in Oxford, England, in April 1975.\n\n\n\n(1) Wong Oi-tong (王愛棠, 1881–1957) (Cited from Li Zhigang, 2014: 31-35)\n\n\nWong Oi-tong, born in Dongguan, Guangdong, was a third-generation Christian. His grandfather, Wong Chun-kwong, and father, Wong Siu-tuen, were both members and preachers of the Rhenish Mission. Wong Oi-tong studied at the Rhenish Primary School in Fuyong, Bao’an County, before attending Rhenish Secondary School in Yeshan, Tangxia, Dongguan. At the age of 20, he entered the Rhenish Theological Seminary in Dongguan and graduated at 22. The following year, he was ordained as a preacher for the Rhenish Mission. After arriving in Hong Kong in 1909, he remained there permanently. \n\n\nIn 1914, when the Rhenish Church in Hong Kong was established, Wong assisted Pastor Chan Koon-hai in managing church affairs. During World War I, due to hostilities between Britain and Germany, German missionaries in Hong Kong were ordered to leave. As the Rhenish Mission had German roots, it was placed under the custody of the London Missionary Society. Wong drafted and established the church's regulations during this period. In 1917, he was ordained as a pastor in Humen. By 1925, after the London Missionary Society completed its custodianship, the Rhenish Mission achieved self-governance. In 1926, Pastor Yip To-sheng arrived to take over church administration, and Wong was elected Vice President of the General Assembly.\n\n\nWong was also a founding member of the Hong Kong Christian Council in 1914, serving as its first secretary and drafting its constitution. He held various roles, such as head of the Council's Evangelism and Public Cemetery Departments. Wong actively opposed the practice of keeping slave girls, publishing articles in The Great Light Newspaper to condemn this custom. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in 1941, Wong was appointed President of the Japanese-controlled Hong Kong Christian Council due to the Rhenish Mission's German background. After the war, the Council was disbanded, and its departments resumed their activities. Wong suffered a stroke in December 1948, leaving him paralyzed, and he passed away in May 1957.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(2) Moritaka Samejima (鮫島盛隆, 1897–1986)  \n\n(Cited from Chen Zhiheng, 2009: 234-246; Samejima Moritaka, 1971)\n\n\nMoritaka Samejima was born in December 1897 in Sasebo, Nagasaki. After graduating from the Kansai Gakuin Theological Department in 1927, he pursued further studies at Emory University and the San Francisco Theological Seminary. In 1931, he was ordained as a pastor at the Kobe Hirano Methodist Church and became the district superintendent of the Korean Methodist Church in Seoul in 1934. In 1941, he was appointed Chaplain (later Religious Director) at Kansai University.\n\n\nIn September 1943, Samejima was summoned to Hong Kong to serve as an advisor to the Japanese-controlled \"Hong Kong Christian Council,\" a position he held until the war's end. His primary duty was to act as a liaison between the Japanese governor’s office and the Christian churches. For instance, upon learning that the Japanese military intended to remove the stained-glass windows of St. John’s Cathedral, Samejima intervened to ensure their preservation. He also opposed the conversion of churches into stables and worked to secure the release of Reverend Chang Chu-ling, who was falsely accused of espionage by the Japanese military.\n\n\nAfter Japan's surrender, Samejima was interned and later repatriated to Japan. In 1946, he returned to Kansai Gakuin as Dean of Student Affairs and served as the eighth Chaplain from November 1946 to June 1948. From 1951 to 1974, he was the President of Chinzei Gakuin. Samejima revisited Hong Kong in 1969, where he was warmly received by the local church community. In 1970, he published Recollections of Hong Kong: The Church Under Occupation, which was translated into Chinese the following year. He passed away in February 1986.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(3) Yan-Tak Woo (胡恩德, 1907–2005)  \n\n(Cited from Xing Fuzeng, 2014a: 203-206)\n\n\nYan-Tak Woo was born in May 1907 into a prominent Christian family in Hong Kong. His grandfather, Woo Him-hang (1830–1889), was a pastor in the Berlin Mission, while his father, Woo Yee-tung (1884–1948), served as a deacon at St. Stephen’s Church under the Anglican Church. Yan-Tak Woo was the second of eight children. He was baptized at St. Stephen’s Church at birth. His mother, Wong Pik-lin (1885–1965), was the seventh daughter of Pastor Wong Chim-yu (1847–1907), a minister in the Rhenish Mission and a member of the Chinese Evangelistic Society founded by Karl Gützlaff.\n\n\nWoo attended Ying Wa Girls' School and a sports school in Central before enrolling at Diocesan Boys’ School. In 1926, while preparing for the University of Hong Kong’s entrance exam, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved to his cousin’s clinic in Aberdeen to recover. During this period, he attended the first Believers’ Bible Conference in 1927, where he was deeply influenced by Pastor Wong Yuen-so (Christian and Missionary Alliance in Guangxi). Woo experienced a profound spiritual awakening, leading to his active ministry. \n\n\nFrom 1930 to 1935, Woo assumed full-time ministry responsibilities at the Joyful Church, initially established by Julia Meadows, a faith missionary. He continued leading the church through its relocations and name changes, eventually settling in Tai Po Road under the name Joyful Gospel Church by 1937.\n\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in 1941, Woo refused to join the Japanese-controlled Christian Council, citing \"differences in faith.\" As a result, he faced pressure and was briefly detained by the Japanese military police on suspicions of collaborating with Western powers.\n\n\nAfter the war, Woo was invited to lead revival meetings across China and became a prominent preacher, especially influential in student fellowship movements. His ministry and the Joyful Gospel Church became significant references for the evangelical movement in Hong Kong. Woo later served as the principal of seminaries in Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. He authored numerous works, including Running Toward the Goal, Table Devotions, and The Christian and the Sabbath. Woo passed away in 2005 after a long illness.\n\n(1)王愛棠 Wong Oi-tong（李志剛2014：31-35）\n\n\n王愛棠（1881–1957），廣東東莞人，第三代信徒，祖父王振光、父親王肇端是禮賢會信徒及傳道。王愛棠於寶安縣福永禮賢小學就讀，後進入東莞塘廈耶山禮賢中學。20歲進東莞禮賢會神學院，22歲畢業後，翌年受禮賢會宣教師職。自1909年來港後，一直留港。1914年香港禮賢會堂落成後，王愛棠協助陳觀海牧師主理堂務。自歐戰爆發後，由於英德兩國為交戰國，德國在香港的傳教士限令離港。禮賢會具德國背景，教會須由倫敦會接管作監護人。是時教會規章悉由王愛棠起草訂立。1917年在虎門按立為牧師。1925年後，倫敦會完成托管，禮賢會已具自理基礎。1926年禮賢會差會按葉道勝牧師來港接收事務，王愛棠被選為總會會副。\n\n\n1914年，香港基督教聯會創建，王愛棠為起草章程委員，並出任首屆聯會書記。歷任聯會傳道部、公墳部部長等職。他亦積極參與反對蓄婢運動，曾撰文於《大光報》，指斥蓄婢惡習。1941年12月25日香港淪陷後，日本為控制基督教，於1942年2月成立香港基督教總會，要求各宗派突會合一，隸屬總會。由於日本與德國為同盟關係，故正會長一職，由德國背景的禮賢會王愛棠出任，成為日治時期香港教會領袖。戰後，總會解散，聯會各部復員。1948年12月，因突發腦溢血致身體癱瘓，1957年5月離世。\n\n\n(2) 鮫島盛隆 Moritaka Samejima（陳智衡2009：234-246；鮫島盛隆1971）\n\n\n鮫島盛隆（Moritaka Samejima, 1897-1986），1897年（明治三十年）12月生於長崎佐世保市。1927年，關西學院神學部畢業後，畢業於埃默里大學（Emory University）神學部及研究院，以及舊金山神學院研究院。1931年，按立為日本衛理公會神戶平野教會牧師，1934年被任命為漢城衛理公會牧師兼朝鮮教區長。1941年就任關西大學禮拜主任（1943年4月後更名為宗教主任）。\n\n\n1943年9月起，應召徵調至香港任「香港基督教總會」顧問，至休戰止。1943年9月，鮫島經上海到廣州抵九龍。總會顧問一職，主要任務是作為總督部與基督教會間的溝通。例如，在得悉日軍欲拆除聖約翰座堂的彩繪玻璃後，他立即向高級副官反映，最後可讓教會自行拆下保存。對於部分教堂內設置被拆毀，甚至被改為軍隊馬廐，鮫島均不予認同。又，合一堂張祝齡牧師被日軍誤為「間諜」被捕，鮫島亦多方營救。他曾指出，日軍高級軍人一般較尊重教會，橫蠻殘酷者多為低級官兵。可以說，鮫島作為日本顧問牧師，確在各種限制下，致力協助淪陷期間香港基督教的維持。日本投降後，他也被送到扣留營中，等候遣交回日本。\n\n\n1946年，他回到關西學院擔任學生課長。自1946年11月至1948年6月間，任關西學院堂禮拜第八任牧師。1951年至1974年間，就任鎮西學院院長。1969年夏天，鮫島重訪香港，並獲香港教會界熱情接待。他在1970年出版了有關香港的回憶錄《香港回想記：占領下の教会に召されて》，翌年中譯本《香港回想記：日軍佔領下的香港教會》在香港出版。1986年2月離世。\n\n\n(3) 胡恩德 Yan-Tak Woo（邢福增2014a：203-206）\n\n\n胡恩德（1907-2005），廣東鶴山人。1907年5月生於香港的著名基督徒世家，其祖父胡謙亨（胡夑菴，1830-1889）是巴陵會（Berlin Mission）牧師。父親胡爾棟（1884-1948）是聖公會聖士提反堂執事，與妻王碧蓮（1885-1965）育有子女八人，胡恩德是次男，出生後即於聖士提反堂領洗。母親是王謙如牧師的七女，王謙如（1847-1907）是香港禮賢會牧師，其父王元深（1817-1914）早年為郭實獵（Karl F. A. C. Gützlaff）創立的福漢會成員，後成為禮賢會資深元老。\n\n\n胡恩德先後於英華女校及中環鐵崗的體育學校就讀，後入讀拔萃書院。1926年參加港大入學試期間，發現患上肺癆，乃遷居堂兄胡惠德於香港仔的診所樓上養病。期間參加1927年舉辦的第一屆培靈研經會，深受講員黃原素（廣西宣道會）牧師感召，「你知道自己得救沒有？」對他影響尤深。他深覺自己雖在教會長大，卻全無得救把握。他晚上深切為己罪悔改，並寫自己所患的十多件罪行，逐一認罪。同年，胡恩德再讀到倪柝聲編著的《靈修指微》、《十字架的使者》、《人是因做好得救麼？》、《得救的實證》等著作，深受影響。1928年，他開始到信心傳教士美愛清（Miss Julia Meadows）創立喜樂堂聚會，自此改變了其事奉路向。1930至1935年間，美姑娘因身體關係曾兩度回國，胡即承擔全時間傳道工作。美姑娘第一次離港時，聖經學校停辦，教會遷至醫局街，1934年又遷往鴨寮街。期間，教會的名稱改為「喜樂福音堂」。1934至37年間，一度易名「福音堂」。1936年夏，美姑娘再回國，此後未有回港。1937年， 教會遷大埔道，再用「喜樂福音堂」的名稱。\n\n\n1941年12月，香港淪陷。日本總督部對基督教的主要政策，是設立香港基督教總會，要求所有教會不分任何宗派，統一加入。總會由日本派來的牧師鮫島盛隆任顧問，王愛棠及劉粵聲分別出任正、副會長。當時大部分教會因形勢所逼，均加入總會。但胡卻以「信仰不同」為由拒絕參加，為此承受不少壓力。同時，日本憲兵亦懷疑他與英美勾結，故一度將他扣留於深水埗憲兵部，未幾獲釋。\n\n\n戰後，胡恩德應邀到內地（廣州、廈門、南京等地）領會，也跟趙君影牧師等合作。胡恩德是當時受重用的講員，獲邀主領許多夏令會及培靈會，燃點了復興之火，特別對學生團契的復興，更功不可沒。胡恩德的個人靈命、喜樂福音堂的會堂路線及聚會模式，成為福音堂運動的屬靈路線的重要參照。\n\n\n胡恩德曾擔任海外的神學院（新加坡、菲律賓）及香港廣州聖經學院的院長。1965、1966及1973年，他先後獲邀任港九培靈研經會的講員，負責研經會及講道會。此外，他又出版多種著作，如《朝向目標直跑》、《桌前默想》、《祂是信實的》、《靈程點滴》、《從聖經看靈恩運動》、《靈恩運動》、《勝利生洽秘袂》、《基列的乳香》、《基督徒與安息日》等多種。2005年，因病辭世。\n\n(4) John So (蘇佐揚, 1916–2007)  \n\n(Cited from Li Jinqiang, 2014: 211-213)\n\n\nJohn So was born in 1916 in Hong Kong to a Christian family from Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province. A third-generation Christian, So was passionate about music and literature from an early age, composing over 600 Hymns of Heaven and Earth and more than 200 Sacred Songs of Heaven and Earth throughout his life. In 1931, he committed to serving God after attending a revival meeting in Kowloon led by Chinese evangelist Song Shangjie (John Sung). In 1934, So went to the North China Theological Seminary in Teng County, Shandong Province, for theological education. After graduating in 1937, he engaged in rural evangelism in Zhangjiakou, Chahar, and Shanxi before returning to Hong Kong.\n\n\nIn 1940, So was invited to assist in editing a Hebrew dictionary and teaching music at the North China Theological Seminary. In 1941, Pastor Yang Shaotang invited him to teach Hebrew in Tianjin’s Spiritual Work League. Later, he returned to Hong Kong to teach biblical studies at the Bethel Theological Seminary, which had relocated from Shanghai. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, So fled to Zhangzhou, Fujian, where he founded the Heaven and Earth Daily. In 1943, he joined the faculty at Guizhou Bethel Theological Seminary, where he also launched The Gospel Magazine for the Miao Christian community. He later taught at the China Spiritual Theology Seminary in Chongqing, working alongside Pastor Jia Yuming.\n\n\nIn 1945, So served as the General Secretary of the “Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Christian Federation,” promoting inter-church initiatives in Northwest China. He was ordained as a pastor in Gansu in 1947 and later worked in Shanghai with the China Inland Mission on literature ministry before returning to Hong Kong in 1948.\n\n\nBetween 1953 and 1961, So embarked on an eight-year evangelistic journey across East Asia, preaching in 13 countries, including Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Indonesia. From 1962 to 1976, he undertook global evangelistic tours across six continents and more than 50 countries. In 1976, after returning from the Americas, he became president of the “Global Evangelistic Association” and founded the “Christian Heaven and Earth Society,” publishing over 50 books, including Bible Difficulties (10 volumes), New Testament Meditations (8 volumes), and Old Testament Insights (3 volumes). \n\n\nHe passed away in September 2007 at the age of 91.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(5) John K.

As a teenager, he accompanied his father, Pastor Ma Yaodong, in street evangelism, playing the accordion and leading hymns. After graduating from Wah Yan College in 1935, he worked at the Salvation Army in Guangzhou. During World War II, he served as a member of the International Relief Council. In 1944, Ma graduated from the Union Theological Seminary in Guangzhou and became the pastor of the Qujiang Chapel of the Chinese YMCA in 1945. The following year, he was appointed Youth Secretary of the Guangdong Association of the Chinese Christian Church and was ordained as a pastor at Renji Chapel in Guangzhou in 1946.\n\n\nIn 1947, Ma attended the World Christian Youth Conference in Oslo, where he reaffirmed his lifelong call to ministry. After the conference, during a stopover in Hong Kong, he learned of the Congregational Church’s urgent need for leadership. In September 1947, Ma decided to stay and became the second senior pastor of the Congregational Church, serving for 40 years until his retirement in 1987, except for a year of advanced study at Union Theological Seminary in New York (1956–1957).\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Ma initiated the construction of new church facilities. To fund the Leighton Road Chapel, he proposed issuing bonds with a 5% annual interest, a plan that successfully raised the required funds within a year. The chapel, initially called “Caroline Hill Road Chapel,” was dedicated in 1950. Later, Ma led the redevelopment of the Ladder Street church building, completed in 1971 and renamed “Bridges Street Chapel.”\n\n\nMa also taught at theological institutions, including the Hong Kong Theological Seminary, Chung Chi Divinity School, and the Lutheran Theological Seminary. He served as chairman of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China and as vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. Ma suggested limiting the union board members’ terms to six years with a mandatory one-year break after.\n\n\nHe passed away in April 2011 at the age of 94.\n\n\n---\n\n\n(6) Denial Cheung (張有光, 1917–1996)  \n\n(Cited from Wong Cailian, 2014: 42-46)\n\n\nDenial Cheung was born in 1917 in Gaoming, Guangdong Province, into a pastor’s family. His father, Cheung Shing-yau, was a minister of the Holiness Church.

She arrived in China in 1938 and served for 12 years in Shaanxi Province. After leaving China in August 1951 and returning to Norway, she remained committed to missionary work among Chinese communities. In 1952, the Mission Covenant Church of Norway initially rejected her application to return to the Far East due to concerns about limited opportunities in Taiwan and Hong Kong, recommending Africa instead. After negotiations, the church agreed to provide only a monthly stipend without additional funding.  \n\n\nIn 1953, Berntsen arrived in Hong Kong and joined missionary Hanny Grønlund to work with refugees in Rennie’s Mill (調景嶺), establishing the Rennie’s Mill Church Clinic Committee. She later founded a tuberculosis sanatorium, \"Haven of Hope Sanatorium,\" in 1955. The name \"Haven of Hope\" is derived from the Bible, symbolizing the fruits of the Holy Spirit. The same year, a nursing school was established, marking a new era in healthcare development for the community.  \n\n\nIn 1961, the Haven of Hope Chapel was inaugurated, and the Grace Home for Children was established to care for the children of tuberculosis patients. In 1975, the Grace Home expanded its services to severely intellectually disabled children and became fully supported by the Education Department in 1981, transforming into the Grace School and Children's Home. In 1976, the Haven of Hope Sanatorium was renamed Haven of Hope Hospital. By 1990, the Tseung Kwan O District Aid Association was renamed the Christian Haven of Hope Association.  \n\n\nBerntsen retired in 1978 and returned to Norway, where she was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1979.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) William Newbern (劉福群)  \n\n(References: 梁家麟1999: 95-96; 何明章2021: 282-285)  \n\n\nWilliam Newbern (1900–1972) was born into a Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA) family in the United States. He began his missionary service in Guangxi, China, in 1922, was ordained in 1923, and returned to the U.S. between 1925 and 1928 due to political unrest. He returned to China in 1929 and served as principal of Wuzhou Bible Seminary from 1936 to 1944 and again after its reopening in 1946.  \n\n\nAs the political situation in South China deteriorated, the C&MA instructed missionaries in Guangxi to retreat to Hong Kong. In 1949, Newbern proposed reopening the Wuzhou Bible Seminary in Hong Kong despite plans to redeploy missionaries elsewhere. His persistence led to the establishment of the seminary in Hong Kong, initially housed in missionary Robert A. Jaffray's villa on Cheung Chau Island.  \n\n\nThe seminary became a foundation for building C&MA churches across Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. In 1955, the seminary was renamed the Alliance Bible Seminary. Beyond theological education, Newbern promoted sacred music, compiling hymnals like Youth Hymns and organizing annual music concerts at the seminary, which became significant events in Hong Kong's Christian community.  \n\n\nNewbern served as the Field Director of the Hong Kong C&MA Mission from 1954 to 1958, overseeing initiatives such as the \"Five-Year Self-Support Plan\" and forming the Hong Kong Alliance Churches Union in 1959. These efforts marked a step towards local church autonomy.  \n\n\nHe retired in 1968 and returned to the U.S., where he passed away in 1972. His memoir, The Cross and the Crown: My View of the Alliance Bible Seminary, was published posthumously in 1973 and later translated into Chinese in 1976.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Bishop Ralph A. Ward (黃安素)  \n\n(References: 林崇智2015: 111-116; 邢福增2024b)  \n\n\nRalph A. Ward (1882–1958) was born on June 26, 1882, in Ohio, USA. In 1909, he began missionary work in the Fuzhou District under the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was elected Bishop of the West China Conference in 1937 and became Bishop of the Methodist Church in 1941, overseeing the Jiangxi, Central China, and East China Conferences after the church’s unification in 1939.  \n\n\nDuring World War II, Ward was interned in a concentration camp for three and a half years. After leaving China in late 1950, he passed through Hong Kong and was struck by the plight of Chinese refugees.  \n\n\nAlthough he retired in 1952 at the age of 70, Ward was reappointed to oversee ministry to Chinese refugees in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In a 1952 memorandum, Our Continuing Church Among the Chinese People, Ward articulated his vision for serving the 20 million Chinese living outside mainland China, particularly in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  \n\n\nMany Methodist refugees from Shanghai and Fujian struggled to adapt to Cantonese-speaking churches in Hong Kong. Ward and Dr. Sidney R. Anderson established Methodist congregations in North Point (1953) and Yau Ma Tei (1955) to serve these refugees. These churches became a vital continuation of Methodist ministry, providing pastoral care to war-displaced individuals.  \n\n\nBetween 1952 and 1954, Ward reorganized Methodist congregations in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, and Hong Kong. In 1956, he founded the \"Taiwan-Hong Kong Provisional Annual Conference,\" serving as its presiding bishop. Ward passed away in Hong Kong on December 11, 1958, at the age of 76.\n\n(1)司務道 Annie Skau Berntsen（司務道1985；劉義章2005）\n\n\n司務道（Annie Skau Berntsen, 1911-1992），挪威聖約差會（Mission Covenant Church）傳教士，1938年抵中國，於陝西傳教達12年之久。1951年8月離開中國回到挪威後，仍心擊華人宣教。挪威聖約差會因憂慮台灣、香港等地傳福音的機會不多，在1952年拒絕司務道再到遠東的申請，建議她轉到非洲中、南部。惟經多次商討後，差會答允除每月供給生活費外，不支付任何經費。司氏於1953年抵香港後，即與挪威聖約差會傳教士葛瑞霖（Hanny Grønlund）會合，投身調景嶺的難民工作，成立「調景嶺基督教醫務所委員會」（The Rennie’s Mill Church Clinic Committee）。後成立肺病療養院，於1955年奠基及開幕，取名「靈實肺病療養院」；靈實出自聖經，是指聖靈所結的果子。同年，護士學校成立，為靈實以至社區開創醫療發展新里程。\n\n\n1961年，靈實禮拜堂落成。同年，恩光護幼會成立，照顧肺病病人的子女。1975年，恩光護幼院擴大照顧範圍加設嚴重弱智兒童服務部，其後在1981年獲教育署全面資助，發展成一所嚴重智障兒童寄宿學校，並改名為恩光學校暨兒童院。1976年，靈實肺病療養院改名為靈實醫院。1990年，將軍澳區醫援會改名為基督教靈實協會。\n\n\n司務道於1978年退休，回到挪威。1979年  獲英女皇頒授大英帝國官佐勳章(OBE)。\n\n\n(2) 劉福群 William Newbern（梁家麟 1999：95-96；何明章2021：282-285）\n\n\n劉福群（William Newbern, 1900-1972），1900年生於美國宣道會家庭。1922年奉宣道會（Christian and Missionary Alliance）派到中國廣西宣教，1923年被按立，1925至28年間因政治形勢動盪返美，1929年重返中國。1936至44年間，任梧州建道聖經學院院長。1946年復校後，再任院長。差會在華南解放前夕吩咐在廣西的全部傳教士撤至香港，並於1949年7月在香港召開差會會議。當時差會擬將傳教士轉派至東南亞其他工場，但劉福群卻建議留守香港，並尋索在港重開梧州建道聖經學院的可能。\n\n\n1950年8月，宣道會在港召開特別會議，包忠傑（Paul H. Bartel）、丁惠民（August F. Desterhaft）等差會負責同工與華會的沙毅、趙柳塘等均有出席。會議正式議決在香港復校一年，讓畢業班的同學能完成學業。後來，宣道會海外部總幹事施爾德（A. C. Snead）認為中共將在短期內接管香港，遠東的宣教工作，在五年內便會結束，不同意再在港投放太多資源。但劉福群卻不同意他的見解，認為聖經學院應在港繼續維持。因著劉福群的堅持，建道聖經學院得以在香港續辦，以傳教士翟輔民（Robert A. Jaffray）在長洲島的別墅作為校舍。宣道會原在香港沒有事工，在畢業生的努力開荒下，在港九新界各地建立宣道會堂會。1955年，建道聖經學院改名建道神學院。\n\n\n除神學教育外，劉福群在推廣聖樂方面，亦不遺餘力。除參與《宣道詩》的編譯外，他又主編中英對照的《青年聖詩》，希望可以成為一本不分宗派的詩集。他又在建道舉辨聖樂演唱會，成為該院及香港教會界的年度盛事。\n\n\n1954至1958年間，劉福群任香港宣道會西差會主席（Field Director）。1956年，西差會通過香港本地教會推行「五年自養計劃」，並籌劃各堂代表組成本地聯會。1957年，成立「基督教中華宣道會香港區主任會」，1959年成立「宣道會香港堂聯會」，標誌著本地華人走上自治之路。\n\n\n1968年，劉卸下建道院長一職，被任命為榮譽院長。退休後回到美國，1972年安息。著有《十架與冠冕》（The Cross and the Crown: My View of the Alliance Bible Seminary），1973年出版後，1976年譯成中文。\n\n\n(3) 黃安素 Ralph A. Ward（林崇智2015：111-116；邢福增2024b）\n\n\n黃安素（Bishop Ralph A. Ward, 1882-1958），1882年6月26日生於美國俄亥俄州。1909年，他奉美以美會（Methodist Episcopal Church）派到中國福州教區傳教。1937年，獲選為美以美會駐華西區會督。1939年，在華美以美會、監理會（Methodist Episcopal Mission, South）及美普會（Methodist Protestant Mission）合併為衛理公會後，黃安素於1941年獲選為衛理公會會督，監督江西、華中及華東年議會。太平洋戰爭爆發後，黃安素被拘禁於集中營達三年半之久。1950年11月下旬離開中國，取道香港時，目睹大量來自中國的難民，離散漂泊，群羊乏牧。\n\n\n1952年，黃安素以70高齡退休。但他再獲會督總會（Council of Bishops）重新委任，以監督在香港及台灣開展服事中國難民的工作。他在1952年4月一篇題為「我們在華人中的教會將會繼續」（ Our Continuing Church Among the Chinese People）的備忘中闡述其異象，就是在中國境內教會與外界完全隔絕的時候，如何面對居於中國大陸以外的2000萬華人所帶來的挑戰和機遇，特別是在香港及台灣的華人。\n\n\n當時不少自上海及福建避秦南下的衛理信徒，在語言上不諳粵語，無法適應香港的教會生活。他與自上海抵港的安迪生（Sidney R. Anderson）博士決定開設衛理公會。他邀請衛理公會在四十年代派送至美國進修的周郁晞及楊震來港，負責帶領港島北角（北角衛理堂，1953）及九龍油麻地（九龍衛理公會，1955）的事工。兩所堂會的建立，不僅是服事戰亂中顛簸南逃的離散者，讓他們在香港繼續得到適切牧養，也是衛理公會在華事工中黜後，在香港延續福音使命的肇始。1952至54年間，黃安素帶領衛理公會教友在台北、台中、台南及香港等地重新組織起來，並於1956年成立「台灣－香港臨時年議會」，由他任駐區會督。1958年12月11日，黃安素會督在香港因病離世，享年76歲。\n\n (4) Karl L. Stumpf (施同福)  \n\n(References: 胡建斌2024: 107-111)  \n\n\nKarl L. Stumpf (1913–1987) was born in Germany and arrived in Shanghai in 1937, working at a German pharmaceutical company established by Jewish immigrants. During the war, as large numbers of Jews fled to Shanghai, he began a ministry to support Jewish Christians. After the war, he was ordained as a pastor by the Lutheran Church to serve German expatriates in Shanghai and worked at the Shanghai Lutheran Center.  \n\n\nIn January 1952, Stumpf relocated to Hong Kong, where he was appointed Director of the Hong Kong Office of the World Council of Churches (WCC) Refugee Service. In 1954, he became Director of the Hong Kong branch of the Lutheran World Federation’s World Services (LWS), which had been providing services in Hong Kong since 1952.  \n\n\nStumpf was deeply concerned about refugee issues in Hong Kong. While most relief organizations focused on Chinese refugees, the LWS identified stateless foreigners, primarily White Russians and Jews, who urgently required assistance. Together with the WCC Refugee Service, the LWS established the Joint Service to Refugees, assisting 6,000 applicants within its first two months. Over two years, 3,267 foreign refugees secured visas to Western countries, but over 10,000 cases remained unresolved.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, under Stumpf’s leadership, the Lutheran Social Service also aided Chinese refugees in Hong Kong by providing emergency relief such as cash, food, and clothing. In the 1960s, the LWS built several \"Lutheran Villages\" in Hong Kong's New Territories (e.g., Ma On Shan, Ma Tso Lung, Tsing Yi, Tap Mun, and Cheung Chau), funded primarily through donations from Lutheran churches in Europe and North America.  \n\n\nIn 1973, the LWS headquarters in Geneva re-evaluated its priorities, deciding to merge the Lutheran Social Service with the Hong Kong Christian Welfare Council in 1976, forming the Hong Kong Christian Service. Stumpf continued as its Director until retiring in 1979, after which he served as an advisor. During his tenure, he initiated pioneering services, including special education, vocational training, school social work, foster care, elderly homes, halfway houses for drug addicts, and community services.  \n\n\nAfter the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Stumpf extended his work to aid Vietnamese refugees, establishing the Hong Kong Christian Aid to Refugees (renamed Christian Action in 1994). Between 1977 and 1987, he also served as Chairman of the Hong Kong Society for the Blind and held key positions in the Hong Kong Council of Social Service and other welfare organizations.  \n\n\nIn recognition of his significant contributions to post-war relief, refugee aid, and social welfare in Hong Kong, Stumpf was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1966 and the Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 1981. He passed away in Hong Kong in May 1987.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) S. C. Leung (梁小初)  \n\n(References: 容慧雯2023)  \n\n\nS. C. Leung (1889–1968) was born in Foshan, Guangdong. In 1900, he attended the London Missionary Society’s To Chi School in Guangzhou and was baptized in 1903 at the London Missionary Society Church (later the Chinese Congregational Church Wai Oi Church).  \n\n\nIn 1907, Leung interned at the National Committee of the YMCA in Shanghai and returned to Guangzhou in 1909 as a YMCA Secretary. In 1913, he studied at the YMCA College in Chicago and returned to China in 1914. By 1920, he was the General Secretary of the Guangzhou YMCA. From 1926 to 1929, he pursued further studies in the U.S., earning degrees in literature, economics, and education.  \n\n\nUpon returning to China, Leung served as Deputy General Secretary and then Acting General Secretary of the National Committee of the YMCA. From 1935 to 1948, he was its official General Secretary.  \n\n\nAfter retiring in 1948, Leung moved to Hong Kong, where he became Executive Secretary and later Deputy Secretary for Asia at the WCC. He also chaired the Hong Kong Chinese YMCA, served as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Chung Chi College, and was involved with the Hong Kong Christian Council.  \n\n\nIn 1951, during the Christian Accusation Movement in China, Leung was a target of criticism.  \n\n\nLeung joined the Chinese Congregational Church in Hong Kong and served as a deacon and Executive Committee Chair of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China. In 1967, he suffered a stroke and passed away in January 1968. His unfinished memoir, An Unfinished Autobiography – The 77 Memoirs, was posthumously published in 1969.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) Peng Fu (彭福)  \n\n(References: 查時傑1983: 197-206; 胡建斌2024: 123-126; 天風1951: 6)  \n\n\nPeng Fu (1888–1975), born in Runan, Henan, was baptized in 1903 after attending a school established by K. S. Stokke, a missionary of the Lutheran United Mission. He pursued theological studies at Griffith John College in Hankou and later at a seminary in Laoshan.  \n\n\nIn 1916, Peng graduated from the Lutheran Seminary in Hubei and served in the Runan church. He was ordained in 1928 and became Supervisor of the Henan-Hubei Synod in 1930, and later General Supervisor of the Lutheran Church of China in 1937.  \n\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, Peng led the seminary’s relocation to Chongqing and resumed his role as General Supervisor in 1946. In 1949, he chaired the 27th General Assembly of the Lutheran Church of China in Hong Kong and proposed establishing a Mandarin-speaking congregation for refugees.  \n\n\nIn 1951, after severing ties with \"imperialist\" influences, Peng was dismissed as General Supervisor.  \n\n\nIn 1954, Peng helped establish the Hong Kong Lutheran Church and became its first Supervisor. Under his leadership, the church expanded its refugee services and built schools and churches. By the early 1960s, the Hong Kong Lutheran Church had grown to 30 congregations with over 10,000 members.  \n\n\nPeng passed away in 1975 due to heart disease at the age of 88.  \n\n（4）施同福 Karl L. Stumpf（胡建斌2024：107-111）\n\n\n施同福（Karl L. Stumpf, 1913-1987），生於德國，1937年抵上海，於猶太人開辦的德國藥廠工作。戰時大量猶太人湧入上海，他展開救援猶太裔基督徒事工。戰後為便利牧養在滬德國僑民，被信義會按立為牧師，並在上海信義中心工作。1952年1月自滬抵港，被普世教會協會難民服務處（W.C.C. Refugee Service）主任E. H. S. Chandler委任為香港辦事處主任。1954年，任世界信義宗的世界服務部（Lutheran World Federation/ World Services，簡稱Lutheran World Services）香港分部主任。該處總部設於日內瓦，自1952年開始在香港提供服務。\n\n\n施同福高度關注香港難民問題。當時大多救濟組織把重點放在從中國逃至香港的中國難民身上，但世界服務部卻發現有不少流落香港的無國籍外國人，其中以白俄羅斯人及猶太人為主，急須協助。於是，世界信義宗與普世教會協會難民服務處（World Council of Churches Refugee Service）成立聯合機構──難民聯合服務（Joint Service to Refugees），協助外國難民。在最初兩個月，即有6,000人申請協助。兩年後，共有3267名外國難民成功獲得西方國家的簽證，但仍有一萬多人的申請尚無著落。\n\n\n與此同時，在施同福帶領下，信義宗社會服務處又積極幫助湧入香港的中國難民。五十年代，主要以提供緊急物質救援為主，包括供應金錢、食物及衣物，以解決難民燃眉之急，同時又開展醫療服務及房屋供應。其中在六十年代於香港新界各地，興建多條信義村（馬鞍山、馬草壟、青衣、塔門、長洲）。其經費來源，主要是從歐美各地的信義宗教會募捐。\n\n\n1973年，世界信義宗設於日內瓦的總部覺得香港已不是發展計劃中的重要區域，決定調整對香港政策，自1976年1月1日起，世界信義宗社會服務處與「香港基督教服務委員會」合併，易名為「香港基督教服務處」，施同福續任基督教服務處主任，至1979年退休，轉任顧問。擔任主任期間，他仍開創了多項倡導性服務，如特殊學校、職業訓練、學校社會工作、寄養服務、老人宿舍、戒毒者中途宿舍、鄰舍層面的社區服務。\n\n\n1975年越戰結束後，越南難（船）民湧至香港，施同福延續其服務難民的工作，成立香港基督教難民服務處（Hong Kong Christian Aid to Refugees，1994年易名基督教勵行會，Christian Action）。1977至1987年間任職香港盲人輔導會會長。同時，他對香港社會福利事業亦有長期承擔，歷任香港社會服務聯會正、副主席，及社會福利諮詢委員會委員。因應施氏對戰後香港社會救濟及福利，以至難民救援工作，作出重要貢獻。1966年獲頒英帝國官佐勳章（Officer of the British Empire, OBE），1981年獲頒受英帝國司令勳章（Commander of the British Empire, CBE）。\n\n\n1987年5月於香港病逝。\n\n\n（5）梁小初 S.

Originally part of the Swedish American Mission (renamed the Chinese Christian Evangelistic Association in 1931), Wong attended its Daguang Primary School. In 1926, his family moved to Hong Kong, where he joined the Assemblies of God Church. After graduating from Ying Wa College in 1933, he attended Union Theological College in Guangzhou, graduating in 1937. He then pursued advanced studies in religious education at Oberlin College in the U.S., earning a Master of Arts in Theology in 1940 before returning to China.  \n\n\nAfter Guangzhou fell in 1938, the Guangdong Association of the Church of Christ in China relocated to Hong Kong. Upon Wong's return, he served as the Executive Secretary of the Guangdong Association and led youth patriotism campaigns. On October 30, 1940, at the age of 25, he was ordained as a pastor. Shortly afterward, when Hong Kong fell to Japanese forces in December 1941, the association relocated to Zhanjiang and later to Qujiang. After World War II, it returned to Guangzhou, and Wong became its General Secretary in 1947. He was also appointed pastor of Renji Church and received an honorary doctorate (L.H.D.) from Otterbein University that same year.  \n\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wong signed a pledge to support the Three-Self Patriotic Movement on behalf of the Guangdong Association. However, he stepped down as General Secretary in 1951 and focused on pastoring Renji Church. In 1956, under the guise of visiting relatives, Wong moved to Hong Kong permanently, later describing the move as a pursuit of freedom to serve the Lord.  \n\n\nIn 1957, Wong was appointed Executive Secretary of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China (CCC-HK), a position he held for 26 years until 1984. Under his leadership, the council revised its constitution, implemented a ten-year self-support plan, and achieved full financial and administrative independence in 1974. During his tenure, Wong initiated multiple evangelistic campaigns, founded nine churches, and significantly expanded the council’s educational mission, overseeing the operation of numerous schools. By 1982, the council managed 16 secondary schools, 6 affiliated secondary schools, 3 industrial schools, 5 night schools, and 37 primary schools, becoming a leading educational body in Hong Kong. For his contributions to education, Wong was awarded the MBE in 1969.  \n\n\nWong also addressed social issues, emphasizing outreach to the poor through evangelism and service. He was one of the founders of the Christian Industrial Committee, which focused on labor rights.  \n\n\nA strong advocate for church unity, Wong served as President of the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC) for eight terms between 1965 and 1983, making him its longest-serving leader. He also represented the council at various ecumenical conferences and played a key role in rebuilding relationships between churches in Hong Kong and mainland China after the Cultural Revolution.  \n\n\nIn 1980, as President of the HKCC, Wong spearheaded the \"Concern for the Church in China\" initiative. He welcomed a delegation from the China Christian Council to Hong Kong in 1981, marking the resumption of Sino-Hong Kong church relations after 30 years. In September 1981, Wong led an HKCC delegation to China, playing a pivotal role in reestablishing ties between churches in both regions.  \n\n\nIn January 1984, Wong retired as Executive Secretary of the CCC-HK and became Chairman of the council. He passed away on May 15, 1984.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (8) Philip Teng (滕近輝)  \n\n(References: 梁家麟2014: 4-5)  \n\n\nPhilip Teng (1922–2013), born into a Presbyterian family in Shandong, was raised in a devout Christian environment. While studying foreign languages at the National Northwest United University, he felt called to ministry. In 1945, he committed his life to God during a student summer retreat led by evangelist Zhao Junying. Teng later pursued theological studies at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, graduating in 1950 before moving to Hong Kong.  \n\n\nTeng initially assisted Zhao Junying with Christian literature before joining the relocated Guangzhou Bible Seminary in Hong Kong in 1951 as a faculty member and later Academic Dean. In 1952, he also began teaching part-time at the Alliance Bible Seminary, transitioning to a full-time position in 1956. He became Acting Principal in 1966 and served as Principal from 1975 to 1980 when the seminary transitioned to local leadership.  \n\n\nIn 1974, Teng co-founded the China Graduate School of Theology, serving as its first President until 1987. During this time, he concurrently led the Alliance Bible Seminary.  \n\n\nOrdained as a pastor in 1958, Teng chaired the Hong Kong Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA) and its Federation of Churches for 13 consecutive terms. After retiring in 1987, he taught at Nyack College and Alliance Theological Seminary in the U.S. until 1997, where he also chaired the C&MA Chinese Association. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he served as a lecturer at the Hong Kong Pastoral Theological Seminary and volunteered as a pastor.  \n\n\nTeng was a prominent figure in the Chinese evangelical movement, advocating for social engagement. He participated in the 1966 Congress on the Church’s Worldwide Mission and the 1974 Lausanne Congress on World Evangelization.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (9) Timothy Chow (周郁晞)  \n\n(References: 邢福增2024a)  \n\n\nTimothy Chow (1913–2006), born in Baoshan, Jiangsu, grew up in a Methodist Episcopal family. After completing his education at various church schools, he graduated from Soochow University in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts and pursued theological studies at Nanking Theological Seminary, earning a Master of Religious Education and Bachelor of Theology in 1941.  \n\n\nDuring World War II, Chow served as Associate Pastor in Huzhou and later in Suzhou, where he also worked as a hospital chaplain.

She published books including Half the Sky: The Status of Women in Churches (1993), Straightforward Words (1993), Collected Writings of Ching Chee (1998), and My Recollections (2000).  \n\n(1)白約翰 John Gilbert Hyndley Baker（Wickeri 2021）\n\n\n白約翰（John Gilbert Hyndley Baker, 1910-1986），聖公會港澳教區第八任會督（1966-1981），也是香港首位被選舉產生的會督。\n\n\n1910 年10月生於樸次茅斯，1929年入讀牛津大學基督學院，在校時參加基督徒學生運動（Student Christian Movement）。1932年畢業後，曾任倫敦大學基督徒學生運動幹事，後在何明華的感召下，1934年底到中國服務。1935年在廣州救主堂由何明華封為會吏，翌年按立為牧師。曾在廣州聖三一中學及嶺南大學任教，1938年廣州淪陷後，協助救濟難民工作。其後轉到內陸自由區，1939至45年間，任職雲南昆明文林堂（大學生教會），從事學生工作。1945年赴美國紐約協和神學院進修，1947年回到中國後，在上海聖約翰大學任校牧，兼任教於中央神學院。1949年南下廣州，任教於嶺南大學及廣東協和神學院，1951年1月舉家離開中國，結束其在華宣教的服事。\n\n\n離開中國後，白約翰先後任美國基督堂主任牧師、英國聯合教會海外傳道會總幹事及倫敦聖尼古拉堂主任牧師。1966年6月來港任道風山基督教中國宗教文化研究社主任。這年，則好何明華卸下主教，原本選出曾任南非開普敦大主教的杜百鄰（Bishop de Blank）接任，但不料他因健康理由請辭。最後，在9月19日教區議會選出白；約翰為港澳教區主教，並於12月就職。他在就職講辭到，提及（一）推進合一運動；（二）基督教與世界的關係及其社會服務；（三）基督教會與中國及東南亞的聯繫。在其任內，就教會合一，展開了與香港循道公會的商談，又積極回應六六及六七暴動後香港社會的矛盾及問題，1970年發表五年計劃書（1970-75）。1974年，港澳教區成立125週年時，聖公會在香港興辦了46所小學及22所中學，又有14個社會服務單位。\n\n\n另一個白約翰任內重要的工作，是經普世聖公宗諮議會批准，按立普世聖公宗第一位「合法」的女牧師。1971年11月，黃羨雲及班佐時（Joyce Bennet）便由白約翰按手牧師。\n\n\n1980年1月，白約翰申請到訪中國的簽證獲批，他先到深圳一天。2月再重訪廣州，並有機會與李添璦等昔日同工見面。夏天他又到福州一行，並與沈子高、丁光訓及江文漢等重聚。\n\n\n1981年，年屆70歲的白約翰決定退休，港澳教區選出鄺廣傑為首任華人主教。1984年，聖公會將一所元朗的中學以「白約翰會督」命名，以表揚他的貢獻。1986年，\n\n\n(2) 陸漢思 Hans Ltuz（姚超雯2024；麥嘉欣2024；阿離2023）\n\n\n陸漢思（Hans Ltuz, 1936-）：瑞士人，生於基督教家庭，中學時立志獻身。1964年完成神學訓練後，曾赴法國一年，跟隨一名工人牧師生活，參與工業宣教，在玻璃廠工作期間，更深體會工人的需要。回到瑞士後，先在日內瓦教區服務，一年後加入巴色差會（Basel Mission），1968年奉派到香港作勞工宣教。\n\n\n當時正值六七暴動後，陸體會到香港勞工宣教的重要性。他開始參加基督教工業委員會，向政府爭取立法，改善勞工福利。1977年協助成立社區（勞工）教會，與工友分享信仰。他歷年在勞工主日撰寫的講章及禱文，結集成《勞工福音》一書。\n\n\n1971年，他又參與籌組建立香港社區組織協會（Society for Community Organisation, SoCO），服務社會弱勢基層，組織他們爭取權益。1970年代關注人權問題，1976年協助成立國際特赦組織香港分會。1988年，他聯結基督教工業委員會、天主教正義和平委員會、香港社區組織協會，以各工會與學生組織，成立香港人權聯委會，並任主席。此外，他又參與香港公共房屋政策評議會，及荃灣合一社會服務中心。同時，他對囚犯、外傭及難民等弱勢者的困難，亦本基督關心弱勢者的使命投入關注。\n\n\n1992至1997年間，他擔任巴色差會亞洲區秘書，負責管理亞洲區事務，連繫印尼、馬來西亞、台灣等地的教會伙伴。期間協任在當地的部落、鄉村建立教會，並開展教育、醫療及社會服務。同時，又多次到訪中國廣東省教會。\n\n\n2023年11月，陸漢思獲瑞士巴塞爾大學（University of Basel）神學系頒授榮譽博士學位。2024年3月離開香港回到瑞士。\n\n\n(3) 李清詞 Lee Ching Chee（李清詞2000；阿離2013；基督教週報1966 a）\n\n\n李清詞（1933-）：香港出生，香港淪陷期間離港避難，在廣州完成小學。1946年回港後，入讀英華女校，並於1950年畢業。1953年羅富國師範學院畢業後，曾任教聖士提反女子中學。1954年6月受港，同年回母校英華女校任教。1958至59年在英國伯明罕些利渥學院（Selly Oak, Birmingham）攻讀神學，回港後再在英華任教五年。1963年在英國任導師，並於1964至66年在些利渥學院攻讀神學。7月回港，1966年10月被中華基督教會香港區會按立為牧師，成為香港首位被按立的女牧師。\n\n\n1966至77年，任英華女校校牧達11年之久，1972至77年兼任副校長。期間曾代表教會出席普世教會協會第四屆大會，被選為中央執行委員會委員。1977年，受聘到英國出任世界傳道會（CWM, The Council For World Mission, 前倫敦傳道會）宣教教育幹事，專責推動協助該會分佈世界各地之會員教會宣教事工，多次到非洲、印度、南太平洋、澳紐及歐洲地訪問教會，包括當時政局治安不穩，經常宵禁之南非、北愛、緬甸等地區。例如在愛爾蘭威爾斯區礦洞內，她聽到老礦工絕望的呼號：在勞資的對峙中，教會總站在資方一邊，在「維持繁榮穩定」的口號下，無視工人身上被長久剝削的疤。在印度貧民窟，她目睹貧富懸殊下被貶值的生命。她曾在戰亂中的津巴布韋，聽到過黑人青年甘願在彈雨之下，留守國家的誓言，「那是神學也教不到的，是生命的歷練」。這一切，都孕育了李清詞日後敢言及關心社會弱勢的信念。\n\n\n1981年回港後，任中華基督教會香港區會副總幹事，兼屬下中小學校董校監職，至1997年12月底榮休。由於長期服務教會學校的經歷，使她對教會的宗教教育有更深的體會，主張以自由空間而非硬銷強迫方式，來教導學生。同時，對香港教會辦學的理念及目的，她也作出深刻的反思。\n\n\n李牧師積極參與合一事工。自1960年代起，先後多次任香港基督教協進會執行委員會委員、副主席及合一委員會主席等職。曾出版《半邊天—婦女在教會的地位》（1993）及《清心直說》（1993）、《清詞集》（1998）及《我憶故我在》（2000）等書。\n\n (4) David C. P. Lew (1929–1998)  \n\n(Lew, 1968, 1970, 1972; Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union, 1998; Lee, 2014: 99-102)  \n\n\nDavid C. P. Lew, born in Zhongshan, Guangdong, was originally a member of the Guangdong Chinese Christian Church Fujitang in Shanghai. He moved to Hong Kong following the regime change in China. In 1951, he dedicated himself to ministry during a summer camp held by the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China. In 1952, he enrolled at Trinity Theological College in Singapore and graduated in 1955. Ordained by the Church of Christ in China in 1959, he served as the pastor of Kowloon Church and held positions as vice-chairman and head of the publication department of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. From 1968 to 1977, he served as the General Secretary of the Union.  \n\n\nDavid Lew was deeply concerned about social issues. After the 1967 riots in Hong Kong, he wrote an article titled New Directions for Churches in Hong Kong’s Rapidly Changing Society. In it, he criticized churches for becoming “small organizations serving only their members’ spiritual and physical needs,” while remaining indifferent to societal issues. He urged churches to address labor, housing, and unemployment issues, submit memorandums to the government, and advocate for a society that aligns more closely with the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven.  \n\n\nIn a 1972 report as General Secretary of the Union, Lew again criticized churches for ignoring societal “sins, darkness, and violence,” while also cautioning against abandoning gospel principles in the pursuit of social reform. He believed that both extremes failed to effectively witness to the truth of Christ. He emphasized the importance of expressing Christian views to the government while practicing the principle of “being in the world but not of the world.”  \n\n\nWriting under the pen name “Amos” in the Christian Weekly, Lew authored the column Reflections at the City Gate. For instance, in 1970, he foresaw that Hong Kong’s era of reliance on overseas aid for refugees would become a thing of the past.  \n\n\nIn 1975, when Billy Graham conducted his first evangelistic crusade in Hong Kong, Lew served as General Secretary of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union and as the campaign’s Executive Secretary.  \n\n\nAfter stepping down in 1977, he worked for Kirin Press before moving to Toronto in 1981, where he became the Senior Pastor of the Toronto Chinese United Church. In the early 1990s, he helped establish the Toronto Chinese Christian Churches Union. He retired in 1994 and passed away in January 1998.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Yung Chi-tung (1908–1987)  \n\n(CUHK, 1987; Yung, 1960)  \n\n\nYung Chi-tung, born in Zhuhai, Guangdong, and raised in Hong Kong, was the son of Yung Hing-kiu, one of the Chinese students sent to study in the United States during the Qing Dynasty under the program organized by Yung Wing. After graduating from Lingnan School in Guangzhou, Yung studied biology at Tsinghua University, earning his degree in 1929. He stayed on as a teaching assistant and later pursued advanced studies at the University of Chicago, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1937.  \n\n\nReturning to China, Yung taught at Northwest University and later at Lingnan University in Guangzhou, where he held various positions, including department chair, acting dean of the Faculty of Science, acting registrar, and acting president.  \n\n\nIn 1951, Yung moved to Hong Kong and joined the Department of Biology at the University of Hong Kong. In 1959, he became a board member of Chung Chi College and was appointed its third president in 1960. During his tenure, Chung Chi College prepared to join The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). When CUHK was established in 1963, Chung Chi became a founding college, and Yung also served as CUHK’s vice-chancellor. Additionally, he became the founding dean of Chung Chi Theological Seminary in 1963.  \n\n\nYung retired in 1975 and was named honorary president by the Chung Chi College Board. He passed away in Hong Kong in 1987.  \n\n\nBefore Chung Chi joined CUHK, Yung emphasized that the newly established university would operate as a “federated university,” allowing member colleges to retain their autonomy. He believed that Chung Chi College, which means “to revere Christ,” should carry forward the traditions of the 13 Christian universities in China while adapting to new circumstances. He sought to integrate Christian values within the university structure.  \n\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to higher education in Hong Kong, Yung was awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees by the University of Hong Kong (1961) and CUHK (1975). He was also named a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in 1972. In 2006, the new chapel building of Chung Chi Theological Seminary was named the “Yung Chi-tung Memorial Building” in honor of his contributions to Christian education.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) Wu Ming Chieh (1916–1990)  \n\n(Wu Yu Kui, 1996: 22-26)  \n\n\nWu Ming Chieh, born in Henan Province, became a Christian in 1943 and entered Hubei Shakou Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1946. In 1948, due to the Chinese Civil War, the seminary relocated to Tao Fong Shan in Hong Kong, where Wu arrived with faculty and students in December. After graduating in 1950, he served as an assistant preacher at the Lutheran Mandarin Church in Kowloon and was ordained as a pastor in November 1951. In 1952, Wu began mission work in Yuen Long, where he established a Lutheran Church.  \n\n\nIn 1959, he became president of the Lutheran Bible Seminary. In 1961, he was elected Supervisor of the Hong Kong Lutheran Church at its 8th General Assembly, a position he held through multiple terms, including in 1963, 1965, and 1969. Under his leadership, the church developed a seven-year plan for self-sufficiency, gradually reducing financial aid from overseas by one-seventh each year until achieving self-support in 1969.  \n\n\nIn 1968, the Lutheran Bible Seminary merged with another institution to form the Lutheran Theological Seminary, where Wu served as vice president. In 1970, he received an honorary Doctor of Theology degree from Pacific Lutheran University in the United States.  \n\n\nDuring the 1970s, Wu continued his leadership roles, including representing the Lutheran Church in founding the Lutheran Theological Seminary of Hong Kong in collaboration with other denominations in 1976. He also chaired the organizing committee of the World Chinese Evangelical Fellowship in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nIn 1981, Wu retired as Supervisor but was named Honorary Lifetime Supervisor and Honorary Professor at the Lutheran Theological Seminary. He passed away in Hong Kong in September 1990.  \n\n(4) 劉治平David C. P.

In 1994, he moved to the U.S. to serve as president of the Christ Workers Theological Seminary in California, a position he held until 2000. In 2003, he returned to Hong Kong at the invitation of the Evangel Seminary to serve as \"Special Appointed President\" for a year.  \n\n\nPao authored several books, including The Armor of Truth, The Equipment of Life, and commentaries on Colossians, Romans, and Revelation, as well as Theology of the Bible and Christology. Between 1960 and 1995, he served as a speaker at the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bible Study and Evangelistic Conference ten times.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (8) Chan Hay Him (1934–2019)  \n\n(Chan 2015; Fellowship of Evangelical Students, 2019)  \n\n\nChan Hay Him was born in Jieyang County, Guangdong, into a Christian family. At the age of 16, he moved to Hong Kong alone and attended Pui Ching Middle School. In July 1951, he experienced spiritual revival during a summer camp hosted by the Hong Kong Baptist Youth Fellowship. In 1954, during another camp, he responded to a call to ministry. After graduating from high school in 1955, he enrolled at the Hong Kong Baptist Theological Seminary and began attending and serving at the Hong Kong Chiu Chow Baptist Church.  \n\n\nAfter graduating in 1960, Chan dedicated himself to student evangelism.

At age 11, he moved to Foshan, where he joined the Sunday School at the Wen Chang Sha Church of the Methodist Church, cultivating his Christian faith. He later became a Sunday School teacher. In 1940, he was baptized by Rev. Frank White.  \n\n\nIn 1944, Wong committed to becoming a pastor and enrolled at the Union Theological College of Lingnan University in Guangzhou. After graduating in 1948, he was assigned to the Hong Kong Methodist Church. Between 1948 and 1951, he served as pastor of the Kowloon Circuit and was responsible for constructing the new Kowloon Church and establishing a school.  \n\n\nIn 1952, Wong was formally accepted as a Methodist minister. However, due to political shifts, the Hong Kong Methodist Circuit declared its independence from British imperialism in 1951 and operated under the name \"Chinese Methodist Church in Hong Kong Circuit\" until 1955, when Rev. Shearer officiated the ordination.  \n\n\nIn 1959, the Hong Kong Circuit was reorganized as the Hong Kong District under the British Methodist Mission, with Wong serving as District Superintendent. He became Chairman of the Hong Kong District in 1964, overseeing the construction of the North Point Church (1966) and discussing a union with the Methodist Church of China. When the Hong Kong Methodist Church was officially formed in 1975, Wong was elected as its first President, serving two terms until 1982.  \n\n\nWong was a strong advocate for Christian education, overseeing the establishment of several schools, including Methodist School (1951), Methodist College (1958), North Point Methodist School (1964), and Wa Ying College (1971).  \n\n\nIn 1984, Wong was awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) by the Hong Kong government in recognition of his contributions to education and religion.

At age five, she decided she wanted to become a missionary. After graduating from the Royal College of Music, her first job was teaching music in England. However, she continued to feel a call to missionary work.  \n\n\nIn 1965, Pullinger sought opportunities to serve in Hong Kong, but her attempts to secure a position as a music teacher or through churches failed. Undeterred, she arrived in Hong Kong alone in 1966.  \n\n\nPullinger found work teaching music at a kindergarten in the Kowloon Walled City, a lawless area notorious for drug trafficking and triad activity. She established the Kowloon Walled City Youth Club, offering activities such as table tennis and camping trips for local youth. Gradually, young people accepted the gospel message, but many were not welcomed by local churches due to their appearance and gang affiliations.  \n\n\nPullinger began hosting gatherings and even housing addicts in her home, where she helped them overcome addiction through spiritual prayer.

Despite being admitted to the University of Hong Kong, she chose instead to study at Northcote College of Education to serve underprivileged children. She taught at a primary school in Tsuen Wan for six years but stopped due to thyroid cancer. After her recovery, she went to the U.S. in 1963 to study at Moody Bible Institute and later transferred to Wheaton College to study English and American Literature.  \n\n\nWhile studying in the U.S., So felt called to serve in Taiwan. In a letter to a campus fellowship leader, she wrote, \"I do not feel that I belong to Hong Kong...I retain unchanging love for my nation, people, and culture. I have developed a burden for Taiwan.\" Arriving in Taiwan in 1966, she became the editor of Campus magazine, aiming to make it a platform for intellectual Chinese Christians. She introduced the ideas of German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, including his concept of \"cheap grace,\" and wrote articles on Christian theology, later compiled into An Introduction to Christian Theological Thought (1971).  \n\n\nIn 1970, overwork took a toll on her health, leading her to reflect on her life deeply and write the essay \"Only Blessings,\" where she acknowledged her life as being filled with blessings, not curses. Returning to Hong Kong after a cancer relapse, she wrote \"Still Blessings\" and continued serving while recuperating in Singapore, where she founded The Front Line magazine in 1972.

He was ordained in 1972.  \n\n\nIn 1974, Lo succeeded Lam Bun Lap as the General Secretary of Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC), where he served until 2002. FEBC, established in 1945 by Robert Bowman, began broadcasting to Communist China in 1949. By 1958, it had established a recording studio in Hong Kong and was registered there in 1971. During the Cold War, shortwave religious broadcasts served as a vital channel for delivering Christian messages behind the \"Bamboo Curtain.\"  \n\n\nIn response to the revival of the gospel in rural China, Lo proposed founding a \"Rural Bible School\" in 1982 to provide a three-year theological training program for rural believers. This initiative later expanded into the \"Timothy Project\" and, in 1986, was renamed \"Grace Bible Seminary,\" offering training for urban pastors and leaders.  \n\n\nLo faced criticism from the Chinese government for broadcasting religious content to China. Despite being labeled as one of the \"Four Evangelical Leaders of Hong Kong\" alongside Jonathan Chao, Theodore Hsueh, and Wang Yi-ping, he continued his efforts to serve Chinese churches.  \n\n\nAfter retiring from FEBC, Lo founded Ai Hua International Development Ltd, where he continued his ministry for Chinese churches.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (7) Jonathan Chao (趙天恩)  \n\n(李亞丁, nd)  \n\n\nJonathan Chao (1938–2004), born in Liaoning Province, China, moved to Hong Kong in 1949 with his family before settling in Japan and the U.S. In 1966, he earned a Master of Divinity from Westminster Theological Seminary and later completed a Ph.D. in Oriental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania in 1986 with his dissertation The Chinese Indigenous Church Movement, 1919-1927: A Protestant Response to the Anti-Christian Movements in Modern China.  \n\n\nChao co-founded the China Graduate School of Theology and, in 1977, established the Chinese Church Research Center, the first institute in Hong Kong to study contemporary Chinese churches. The center analyzed political, social, and cultural developments in China, publishing China and Church, a key periodical on Chinese Christianity.  \n\n\nIn 1987, Chao founded the Chinese Coordination Centre of World Evangelism, advocating for the \"Three Visions\" of evangelizing the Chinese nation, contextualizing the church in China, and integrating Christianity into Chinese culture. His numerous publications include Refined by Fire: The Secret of Revival in China’s Churches (1993) and A Vision for China (1993).  \n\n\nChao also played a key role in training house church leaders in China, promoting theological education. In 1998, he facilitated the formation of a united statement of faith among China’s house churches.  \n\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to Chinese churches, Geneva College awarded Chao an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1991. He passed away from lymphoma in Los Angeles on January 12, 2004.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (8) W. N. Cheung (張榮岳)  \n\n(教聲, 1978)  \n\n\nW. N.

He attended St. Paul’s College and St. Stephen’s Boys’ School, excelling academically and earning top honors at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1937.  \n\n\nAfter teaching briefly at St. Stephen’s and Diocesan Boys’ School, Cheung was selected by Bishop R. O. Hall to lead Holy Trinity College. He pursued theological studies at Union Theological Seminary and furthered his education at Huachung University.  \n\n\nOrdained as a deacon in 1945 and as a priest in 1946, Cheung was sent to Wellington, New Zealand, to serve Chinese Anglican congregations. Returning to Hong Kong in 1951, he became the Vicar of St. Stephen’s Church and Chaplain of Chung Chi College.  \n\n\nCheung held multiple leadership roles in the Anglican Church and Hong Kong’s education system, including serving as Deputy Chair of the Church’s Education Committee and a representative on the Government’s Education Board.  \n\n\nIn 1978, Cheung was elected Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau, becoming the first Chinese bishop since 1949. He passed away in January 1979.  \n\n(5) 蘇恩佩 So Yan Pui（莊祖鯤2014；黃倩蘊2001）\n\n\n蘇恩佩（1937-1982），廣東中山人，生於香港。畢業於英華女校，在校期間皈信基督，並決志奉獻。預科畢業後為服事弱勢捨棄香港大學的取錄，入讀羅富國師範學院，在荃灣任教小學6年，定意服事貧窮學童。後因甲狀腺癌而停止教學，病情穩定後於1963年到美國芝加哥慕迪聖經學院（Moody Bible Institute）進修，翌年轉至惠頓學院（Wheaton College）修讀英美文學。在美進修時、有感動到台灣服事。她在寫信給校園團契的負責人的信上，表示「不覺得我是屬於香港的……對自己的國家、民族及文代保持不變的熱愛。…我對台灣有了負擔」。1966年抵台後，任《校園》雜誌主編，希望將《校園》變成有份量的中國基督徒知識分子的刊物，並參與校園團契。她在《校園》發表〈廉價的恩典〉，引介了德國神學家潘霍華的思想。她又寫下一系列介紹基督教神學的文章，後來結集成《基督教神學思想簡介》，於1971年由校園出版社出版。書中介紹了新正統主義神學，及近代神學的發展。\n\n\n1970年，因積勞成疾而拖跨身體，療養時對生命有更深的體會，寫下〈只有祝福〉一文，認定自己的生命「只有祝福，沒有咒詛」。這時她決定回到香港，證實癌病復發，期間寫下〈仍是祝福〉一文。病情穩定下來，轉赴新加坡養病，1972年在新加坡創辦《前哨》雜誌。同年底，因健康狀況惡化回到香港後，對服事香港青年一代有更大的負擔，寫下「我能為這個城市做什麼？」。1973年，開始籌辦「突破運動」，翌年創辦《突破》雜誌。1973年發表〈這一代的先信在哪裡？〉：「當裡面的聲音繼續催逼，我就沒有選擇的餘地……在能力範圍之內肩負起『先知使命』。宣告神的審判與憐憫、在社會伸張正義、投身入苦難的世界」。\n\n\n1977年，因身體原因被迫停止編輯工作。1979年底赴美在柏克萊聯合神學院（Graduate Theological Union）及太平洋宗教學院（Pacific School of Religion）休假進修。1982年4月，蘇恩佩在香港病逝，遺言是「我預備好了，沒有一點遺憾」。在離世前出版《死亡，別狂傲》，反映她面對病痛及死亡的心路歷程。\n\n\n(6) 盧家馼 Kenneth Ka Man Lo（）\n\n\n盧家馼（1938-），生於香港。1961年於中華基督教會灣仔堂受洗後，在青年團契事奉。1962年入讀伯特利神學院。1967年任灣仔堂主任，期間赴美國芝加哥三一神學院進修差傳一年。1972年按立為牧師。1974年起，接替赴美進修的林本立任遠東福音廣播公司（Far East Broadcasting Co.）總幹事，至2002年退休。遠東福音廣播成立於1945年，創辦人是鮑曼（Robert Bowman）。自1949年起開始向共產中國進行宗教廣播，1958年在香港設錄音室。1971年組織董事會，在香港註冊。在冷戰時代，宗教廣播透過短波，成為境外向「竹幕」傳遞宗教信息的重要管道。中國政府一直禁止民眾收聽境外廣播，收聽「敵臺」等同反革命罪，但1950年代以降，仍有中國聽眾犯險收聽，甚至寫信到香港遠東。\n\n\n文革後，盧家馼因應中國福音復興現象，1982年提出成立「農村聖經學院」，提供3年制（48科）空中神學課程，呼召農村信徒參與事奉。1986年，擴展至4年制的「提摩太計劃」，並回應城市教會的需求，改名「良友聖經學院」。1995年。良友聖經學院改為2年制，以幫助信徒牧者作「好牧人」為目標。\n\n\n1980年底，中國基督教領袖丁光訓主教會見香港教會人士時，指通過廣播向中國傳教是不尊重及不友善的表現。1984年，國務院宗教事務局局長在北京接見香港基督教訪問團時，仍將對華境外廣播視作「敵視性的廣播」。由於積極推動中國事工，盧家馼（遠東福音廣播）、趙天恩（中國教會研究中心）、薛孔奇（福音證主協會）及王一平（亞洲歸主協會）被中國官方教會人士稱為「香港（福音派）四人幫」。1988年，因應香港九七前途問題，盧家馼計劃在台灣籌設遠東。翌年正式成立台灣遠東廣播協會。1990年成立社團法人，改稱遠東福音會。\n\n\n自遠東退休後，盧家馼成立愛華國際發展有限公司，任會長一職，繼續實踐其「中國心」，服事中國教會。\n\n\n(7) 趙天恩 Jonathan Chao（李亞丁 nd）\n\n\n趙天恩（1938-2004），生於中國遼寧，父親為趙中輝。1949年舉家離開中國，先後在香港、日本及美國居住。1966年，在年代美國威斯敏斯特神學院（Westminster Theological Seminary）完成道學碩士。1986年以“The Chinese Indigenous Church Movement, 1919-1927: A Protestant Response to the Anti-Christian Movements in Modern China”為題，於賓夕法尼亞大學（University of Pennsylvania）獲東方研究哲學博士學位。\n\n\n趙天恩參與創辦中國神學研究院，1977年成立中國教會研究中心，是香港首個研究當代中國教會的研究機構。研究中心致力探討中國政治、社會及文化的最新走向，並從政教關係的角度分析教會的處境與發展。1978年11月出版《中國與教會》雙月刊，成為關注當代中國基督教發展的重要刊物。因當代中國教會評論的政治敏感關係，加上支援內地家庭教會事工引起的壓力，趙天恩在1980年年7月宣布將研究中心從中神獨立出來。1983年，出版《中共對基督教的政策》，是1980年代最早評論有關課題的專著。1997年出版《當代中國基督教發展史（1949-1997）》（莊婉芳合著），也是香港最早全面研究中共建國後基督教發展的史著。\n\n\n1987年正式成立「中國福音會」，提出「中華民族福音化、中國教會國度化、中國文化基督化」的三化異象。1994年，中國神音會在美國成立，原在香港的中國教會研究中心，改為中國福音會香港分會。1996年，在香港的國際總部及研究圖書館遷至台灣 。其他著作包括：《靈火淬煉 : 中國大陸敎會復興的秘訣》（1993）、《扶我前行 : 中國福音化異象》(1993_《洞燭先機 : 中共宗敎政策及三自會論評》(1993)。\n\n\n神學教育方面，除早期參與中神外，趙天恩在1970年應台灣「中華福音神擊院」邀請擔任教授，並建立該校的教務工作。1987年再於香港成立「中國宣道神學院」， 1988年協助台灣「道生神學院」的復校。1989年又受邀任台北「基督書院」院長三年。\n\n\n此外，他又積極參與家庭教會神學培訓事工。1998年，促成中國家庭教會「三大家」（重生派、方城教會、中華福音團契）發表「中國家庭教會信仰告白」及〈中國家庭教會對政府、宗教政策及三自的態度〉。由於積極推動中國事工，盧家馼（遠東福音廣播）、趙天恩（中國教會研究中心）、薛孔奇（福音證主協會）及王一平（亞洲歸主協會）被中國官方教會人士稱為「香港福音派四人幫」。\n\n\n1991年其母校日內瓦大學（Geneva College）爲表彰他對中國教會的貢獻而授予其榮譽法學博士學位。2004年1月12日，趙天恩因淋巴癌病逝於洛杉磯。\n\n\n(8) 張榮岳 W. N. Cheung（教聲1978）\n\n\n張榮岳（1916-1979）牧師，廣東中山縣人，生於香港。早年就讀聖保羅書院及聖士提反男校。1933年中學畢業，考入香港大學，因成績優異，榮獲聖士提反畢業及大學考試金牌獎。1937年取得香港大學文學士學位後，任教於聖士提反男校和拔萃男校年餘，即獲聖公會何明華會督選拔其為聖三一書院院長。 \n\n\n 1940年獲派到協和神學院攻讀神學，並於華中大學進修教育學。1945年獲聖公會封職會吏，翌年晉升為牧師。隨即被差傳至紐西蘭威靈頓之華人聖公會擔任牧養工作。張牧師於紐西蘭期間深造教育學，至1951年8月回港，便被委派至聖士提反堂任主任牧師。\n\n\n1951年崇基學院於成立，成立初期在聖約翰座堂上課，由於聖士提反堂與聖約翰座堂相距不遠，張兼任崇基學院校牧，至1953年。\n\n\n張牧師於聖公會擔任多項職務，包括香港教區議會書記、聖公會出版社主席等，又代表教區出席聖公東南亞地區議會。1971年起任聖公會小學監理委員會副主席，並於1973年起代表聖公會出任港府教育委員會委員。\n\n\n1968年，張榮岳被委為法政牧師，1970年被委為會吏長，專責推動教區的教育事工1978年5月，張榮岳當選港澳教區副會督，不僅是1949年以來香港聖公會首位華人副會督，也是1955年中華聖公會在中國祝聖最後一批4位華人主教後，首次按中華聖公會憲章下封立華人會督。6月，於聖約翰座堂舉行祝聖禮。1979年1月因病離世。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Kwok Nai Wang （郭乃弘 2004）\n\n\nKwok Nai Wang (1938–), born into a Christian family, grew up attending services at the Chinese Congregational Church with his parents. During his childhood, he studied at various schools before transferring to Queen’s College in Form Three. In 1960, he entered the Faculty of Arts at the University of Hong Kong, majoring in philosophy. During his university years, he began serving in the church by teaching Sunday school and participated in the Student Christian Movement, though he also had contact with the Hong Kong University Christian Fellowship.\n\n\nAfter graduating from HKU, Kwok pursued theological studies at Yale Divinity School in the U.S. in 1963. During his time there, he interned at the United Church of Christ and was ordained as a pastor on June 12, 1966, at Centre Church On The Green. He had decided to return to Hong Kong before completing his studies, leaving the U.S. immediately after his graduation ceremony on June 13, 1966.\n\n\nIn August 1966, Kwok began serving as the pastor of Shum Oi Church in Shek Kip Mei, where he became aware of various social injustices and reflected on how the church could better serve the community. In January 1978, he transitioned to serve as the General Secretary of the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC). Starting in 1979, he also took on the role of Director of the Hong Kong Christian Service, succeeding Pastor Karl L. Stumpf until April 1988.\n\n\nIn November 1980, HKCC convened a consultation on the church’s mission for the 1980s, followed by a mid-decade consultation in 1986. Five agenda items were outlined:  \n\n1. Addressing political reform and the drafting of the Basic Law.  \n\n2. Promoting civic education.  \n\n3. Caring for the poor and safeguarding livelihoods.  \n\n4. Encouraging church renewal.  \n\n5. Strengthening church cooperation.  \n\n\nIn November 1986, Kwok attended the High Mountain Conference, advocating for Hong Kong to be governed democratically. Under his leadership, HKCC actively engaged in public affairs and campaigned for democratic progress, drawing criticism from Chinese authorities. Internal disagreements emerged within HKCC, and Kwok stepped down in September 1988, resolving the disputes.\n\n\nAfter leaving HKCC, Kwok founded the Hong Kong Christian Institute in April 1988, providing a platform for Christians concerned about Hong Kong’s future. He served as its General Secretary until his retirement in 2000. During this time, he led the Institute through significant events, including the 1989 Tiananmen protests, the promulgation of the Basic Law, the transitional controversies, and the 1997 handover of Hong Kong. Kwok criticized the church for allocating excessive resources to social services during the 1960s and 1970s, which, in his view, led to the loss of its prophetic voice. He also noted that the church’s relationship with the government had become one of mutual exploitation, undermining its ability to critique societal issues. He foresaw the challenge of \"recolonization\" post-1997.\n\n\nKwok remained a prolific writer, reflecting on issues facing the Hong Kong church. His works include Seeking a Common Path: The Mission of the Church Before 1997 (1990), 1997: A Christian Perspective (1991), Praying for the Peace of This City (1993), The Cry for Justice (1993), Hong Kong Braves 1997 (1994), Towards a Renewed Church (1995), 1997: Hong Kong's Struggle for Selfhood (1996), Hong Kong at the Edge of Recolonization (1996), The Call for Humanity (1997), A Church in Transition (1997), An Exploration of Social Theology (1998), The Gospel of John (1998), The Gospel of Mark: The Light of the Cross (1999), Modern Spirituality (1999), Hong Kong Churches Towards the New Century (1999), Hong Kong After 1997: The First 1000 Days (2000), and Strategies for Renewing Local Churches (2000).\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) James Cheung Mo-Oi （張美萍2018；梁家麟1999）\n\n\nJames Cheung Mo-Oi (1941–2017), originally from Puning, Guangdong, was born in Hong Kong. During the Japanese occupation, his family moved to Shantou. In 1949, after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, they returned to Hong Kong. He attended services at Kowloon City Life Church during his youth and graduated from Methodist School and Wah Yan College, Kowloon.  \n\n\nIn 1965, Cheung pursued higher education in English literature at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, where he participated in the Chinese Alliance Church of Saskatoon. After graduating in 1967, he pursued theological studies at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Chicago, earning an M.A. in Theology and an M.Div. He later enrolled in the doctoral program at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Texas, completing the required coursework in 1973. He began teaching at Canadian Bible College (later renamed Canadian Theological Seminary) while continuing work on his dissertation, which he completed in 1975.\n\n\nIn 1979, during a sabbatical, Cheung returned to Hong Kong to teach at China Graduate School of Theology and assist his father-in-law, Pastor Cheung Yau Kwong, at Kowloon City Baptist Church. After his sabbatical, he returned to Canada. However, Pastor Stephen Tong invited him to serve as the President of Alliance Bible Seminary in Hong Kong, a position he assumed in 1980.\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Alliance Bible Seminary underwent significant growth, including establishing a sacred music department (1983), external studies (1985), and master's programs such as M.Div. (1989). Research initiatives expanded in the 1990s, with the establishment of the Center for the Study of Christianity and Chinese Culture (1993) and the publication of The Journal of Alliance Bible Seminary (1994). Cheung also oversaw campus expansions and the establishment of a new urban campus in Wan Chai.\n\n\nIn addition to theological education, Cheung served as Senior Pastor of Kowloon City Baptist Church from 1990 to 2006. Under his leadership, the church expanded its ministries, launching missions, elder and youth centers, and an adult development center.\n\n\nCheung was also a prolific writer. His publications include The Ecclesiology of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee (1972), Miracles, Healing, Exorcism, and Evangelism, Contemporary Pentecostal Movement: Issues to Watch, The Book of Joshua: Spiritual Battles in a Great Era, and others. From 1979 to 2007, he frequently spoke at the Kowloon and Hong Kong Bible Conferences.\n\n\nCheung passed away in November 2017, aged 76.\n\n(1)郭乃弘 Kwok Nai Wang（郭乃弘 2004）\n\n\n郭乃弘(1938-)，生於基督化家庭，自幼隨父母參與中華基督教會公理堂聚會。童年先後在多所學就讀，最後轉至皇仁書院升讀中三。1960年入讀香港大學文學院，主修哲學，並開始在教會事奉，任教主日學，在學期間參與港大的基督徒學生運動（Student Christian Movement），但也有接觸港大團契。港大畢業後，1963年赴美國耶魯大學神學院進修神學，期間於美國聯合基督教會（United Church of Christ, USA）實習，畢業後（1966年6月12日）於中央教堂（Centre Church On The Green）被按立為牧師。由於他早於畢業前便決定回香港事奉，所以在6月13日畢業禮結束後即離美經歐洲回港。\n\n\n1966年8月起，任中華基督教會深愛堂主任。深愛堂位於石硤尾徙置區，令他認識到社會各種不公義的問題，得不反省教會如何服事社區。1978年1月起，郭轉任香港基督教協進會總幹事。1979年起，兼任基督教服務處主任，接替退休的施同福（Karl L. Stumpf）牧師，至1988年4月卸任。\n\n\n1980年11月，協進會召開八十年代教會使命諮詢會議，86年再召開八十年代中期的使命諮詢會議，並擬定五個課題作為議程：（1）關注政制改革及基本法草擬；（2）推廣公民教育；（3）關懷貧苦，保障民生；（4）推動堂會更新，（5）加強教會合作。\n\n\n1986年11月，郭乃弘出席高山大會，發言時表達對港人以民主方式治理香港的訴求。由於協進會在郭帶領下積極關注香港公共事務，並爭取加快民主進程，結果引起中方的不滿。協進會內部出現路線分歧，到1988年9月郭乃弘離開協進會，爭議才結一段落。\n\n\n離開協進會後，郭在1988年4月創辦香港基督徒學會，作為凝聚一群關心香港前途的基督徒可以繼續發聲的平台。他出任學會總幹事，至2000年退休。期間帶領學會經歷八九民運、基本法頒佈，後過渡期爭議以至九七主權移交。他曾批評香港教會在六、七十年代把大量資源投入社會服務，結果付上了喪失社會良知身分的沉重代價，並認為由於教會與政府間密立了互相利用的關係，最終使教會失去了能夠提出社會批判的位置。至於那些被視為香港教會對社會作出的貢獻，只不過「在於對社會上產生的問題作出補救、治理，卻沒有追溯問題產生的根源。這是一種治標不治本的社會參與」。早於在1997年前，他已提出1997後，香港面對「再殖民地化」的挑戰。\n\n\n郭乃弘在積極關心社會之餘，亦不忘著述，反省香港教會問題：《共覓前路：九七當前的教會使命》（1990）、1997: A Christian Perspective (1991)、《為這城求平安》（1993）、《公義的呼喊》（1993）、 Hong Kong Braves 1997 (1994)、《共闖明天：讓地方教會重新得力》（1995）、1997: Hong Kong Struggle for Selfhood (1996)、《再殖代邊緣的香港》（1996）、《人性的呼喚》（1997）、A Church in Transition (1997)、《關社神學初探》（1998）、《約翰福音》（1998）、《馬可福音──十架的光輝》（1999）、《現代人的靈修》上下（1999）、《邁向新世紀的香港教會》（1999）、Hong Kong after 1997: The First 1000 Days (2000)、《更新地方教會的策略》（2000）。\n\n\n(2)張慕皚 James Cheung  Mo-Oi （張美萍2018：24-25；張美萍、鄭坤英2018：26；梁家麟1999：307-308、314-316、320-321、323-327）\n\n\n張慕皚（1941-2017），廣東普寧人，生於香港。香港淪陷期間，舉家移居汕頭。1949年中共建國後，由汕頭回到香港。幼時參加九龍城生命堂聚會，先後於循道小學及九龍華仁書院畢業。1965年赴加拿大沙省（Saskatoon ）University of Saskatchewan升學，主修英國文學，期間參與雷城華人宣道會聚會。1967年大學畢業後，赴美國芝加哥三一神學院深造，先後獲取文學碩士（MA in Theology） 及神道學碩士（M.

In 1962, he fled to Hong Kong. During the 1970s, he participated in the \"Movement to Establish Chinese as an Official Language\" and the Diaoyu Islands defense movement. He later joined the Industrial Committee and began working as a journalist for Workers' Weekly, marking the start of his involvement in labor movements. From the 1980s, Lau became an active figure in Hong Kong's labor movement, serving as Director of the Christian Industrial Committee (CIC) from 1980 to 2006. In 1981, he founded the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims. In 1990, he organized a new labor union federation, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU), and became its founding chairman.  \n\n\nIn his early years in Guangzhou, Lau attended a Christmas gathering at the Sacred Heart Cathedral and first heard about Jesus. After arriving in Hong Kong, his landlord was a Christian and invited him to attend church services. When Lau joined the CIC, he was not yet a Christian. A colleague once evangelized to him, but he replied, \"Unless all of humanity is liberated, individuals cannot be liberated.\" In 1974, during a labor dispute, he experienced unfair treatment from workers, prompting him to reflect on the issues of human nature and sin. This experience, coupled with a moving encounter with a pastor in Myanmar, led to his decision to accept Jesus. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he first joined the Anglican Church and later switched to the Hong Kong Methodist Church, where he was baptized in 1975.  \n\n\nFrom 1991 to June 30, 1997, Lau served as a Legislative Council member.

On November 14, 1975, he committed his life to Christ at a Billy Graham evangelistic rally. Following the rally, he was referred to the Alliance Church in Wong Chuk Hang, near his residence. However, as a pre-university student preparing for college entrance exams, Leung found it challenging to adapt to church culture and left by February 1976. During this period, a Christian teacher at his school gave him a copy of Breakthrough Magazine. After completing his exams in May, he occasionally read the magazine and noticed an advertisement for the first \"Breakthrough Reader Camp,\" which rekindled his spiritual journey. In September of the same year, he was baptized at Wong Chuk Hang Church, marking the beginning of his deep connection with the Christian and Missionary Alliance.\n\n\nIn September 1976, Leung enrolled in the History Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), United College. In his second year, he decided to pursue research on Chinese church history, driven by the integration of his academic discipline and faith. After graduating in 1980, he pursued a Master of Philosophy degree with a focus on Christian education in Guangdong. Upon completing his master’s degree in 1982, he joined Breakthrough as an editor while continuing his doctoral studies. In 1984, he left Breakthrough to work full-time as a teaching assistant at CUHK and earned his Ph.D. in 1985.\n\n\nIn 1983, Rev. Hung Tong-Mien, a consultant pastor at Wong Chuk Hang Church and a faculty member at Alliance Bible Seminary, recommended Leung to teach Chinese church history as a guest lecturer at the seminary. After completing his Ph.D. in 1985, he joined the seminary as a full-time lecturer at the invitation of President Chang Muk-Wai. To gain a comprehensive theological education, Leung pursued studies at Regent College in Canada in 1987. Before leaving Hong Kong, he compiled his lecture notes on Chinese church history into his first book on the subject, The Gospel Comes to China: Ten Lectures on Modern Chinese Church History.

After completing his training, Chu returned to Hong Kong and served as Assistant Dean at the Hong Kong Baptist Theological Seminary.\n\n\nIn 1973, Chu began pastoral ministry at Chai Wan Baptist Church. He envisioned the church as a \"community parish\" that served local residents. By 1988, under his leadership, the church had constructed a new eight-story building that housed both worship and community services. Chu served as Senior Pastor until 2010.\n\n\nChu was also involved in various social and political causes. In the 1980s, he led efforts to advocate for the construction of Eastern District Hospital and supported drug rehabilitation ministries. He chaired the Christian Concern for the Homeless Association and applied the self-financing model to vocational training centers for recovering addicts.\n\n\nPolitically, Chu joined the Hong Kong Christian Council's Public Policy Committee in 1982 and the Joint Committee for the Promotion of Democratic Government in 1987. He played a pivotal role in the 1989 Tiananmen protests, organizing \"Operation Yellowbird\" to rescue dissidents. In 1997, he received the Order of the British Empire from Governor Chris Patten.\n\n\nAfter returning to Hong Kong in 1998, Chu chaired the Hong Kong Democratic Development Network, advocating for universal suffrage and opposing Article 23 legislation. He also co-founded the \"Occupy Central with Love and Peace\" movement in 2013 with Benny Tai and Chan Kin-man. In 2019, Chu and the other \"Occupy Trio\" were convicted of \"public nuisance\" charges but received suspended sentences due to Chu’s health.  \n\n\nIn 2020, Chu relocated to Taiwan, where he completed his memoir, The Bell Ringer Speaks.\n\n(6) 李炳光 Li Ping Kwong（李炳光2019）\n\n\n1997年，李炳光出任香港基督教衛道衛理聯合教會會長，並於2000年連任。他曾於1988至1994年間出任會長一職，合共4屆，是1975年該會成立會長任期一職最長的牧師。\n\n\n李炳光（1938-）生於香港。香港淪陷期間，舉家曾逃難至廣州，後來因李父遇上鬍騙子，財物盡失而回到香港。50年代初，父親經營的藥材店結束，鋪位租給一家洋服店，其中一名店員是基督徒。有一晚，店員帶他參加灣仔循道公會的晚堂崇拜，自此開始了信仰的追尋。除青少年小組活動外，他也熱心參加查經經，組織祈禱會，並參加醫院佈道隊。\n\n\n在拔萃男書院畢業後，李炳光在1958年被循道公會接納為神學生。1959年1月，保送到新加坡三一神學院進修神學。1962年底畢業後，再被教會派到香港大學修讀青年事工校外課程，完成6個月的學習後，被按到循遁公會九龍堂任助理牧師，協助黃仲凱牧師，並任循道中學助理校牧。未幾，循道公會計劃於觀塘區建立教會，便派李兼任開荒工作，並在雞寮區的循道小學任校牧。1966年，他被教區調派到北角堂開荒，同年9月被按立為牧師。1969年，接任香港堂主任牧師，任內開設「學生自修中心」、影音佈道及錄音佈道等新事工。1977年，獲選為「十大傑出青年」。\n\n\n1984年，九七問題引發移民潮，不少循道衛理聯合教會會友移民到加拿大，希望在當地建立循道宗華人教會。李應邀到多倫多建立教會，他乃向總議會請假一年，協助多倫多華人循道會。一年後回到香港，被派到原衛理公會背景的安素堂任主任牧師，1989年再被調派至九龍堂。期間於1988年當選為循道衛理聯合教會會長。1993年任香港堂主任牧師，負責重建香港堂工作，期間於1997年再度當選會長，至2003年退休。退休後，李炳光仍以退休牧師身分，協助九龍堂工作，又成立「循道衛理佈道團」，以及「教會關懷貧窮網絡」。\n\n\n除循道衛理教會外，李炳光曾任香港基督少年軍會長、香港基督女少年軍榮譽會牧、華人基督教聯會執行董事、基督教協進會主席（1997-2023）、香港中華基督教青年會董事。他又任第三屆（2007）、第四屆（2012）、第六屆（2022）選舉委員會基督教選委。\n\n\n(7)朱耀明（朱耀明2023）\n\n\n1997年6月4日六四燭光晚會後數天，朱耀明牧師離開香港，出走美國，1998年5月回到香港。\n\n\n朱耀明（1944-），廣東台山人，生於香港，幼年時被送回鄉下，由祖母撫養。小學五年級時，祖母病逝。未幾，祖母生前為他辦理到香港定居的申請獲批，年僅10歲的朱耀明便來到香港，叔叔為他找到佐敦廟街一洋服店當留宿學徒。13歲時，朱決定出走，睡在大埔道和南昌街的騎樓底，並當上擦鞋童。後來，再回到洋服店工作。未幾，他因患上「風濕性心臟病」而留於九龍醫院留院，在病床上第一次在聖誕節報佳音中聽到「福音」。出院後，有人介紹他到銅鑼灣一間士多送貨兼寄住。16歲那年，遇到生命中的守護者，介紹他到堅道真光中學附屬第一小學當留宿校役。有一次，他出席堅道浸信會的佈道會時，受感動而決志信主。1961年12月，在堅道浸信會受浸成為基督徒。翌年參加夏令會時，立志奉獻自己。\n\n\n為了成為上帝僕人，朱耀明辭去校役工作，入讀壽山中學高中。中學畢業後，靠著大專貸款、華僑日報獎學金及兼職，於珠海書院半工半讀文史系。1969年畢業後，赴台入讀台灣浸信會神學院，期間認識了周聯華牧師。完成神學訓練後，朱耀明回到香港，出任香港浸信會神學院院長助理。\n\n\n1973年，為回應昔日奉獻傳道的呼召，朱耀明轉到柴灣浸信會福音堂事奉，出任堂主任一職。此時，香港政府正銳意發展柴灣區，朱耀明希望教會成為一所「社區教區」，服務社區居民。1978年，教會自立，朱被按立為牧師。他開始向政府申請撥地。1984年，獲批准興辦社會服務及幼稚園。他為建堂而努力籌款，終於在1988年樓高8層的柴灣浸信會新堂落成。除了禮拜堂外，也成為服務社區的服務大樓。朱耀明一直在柴灣浸信會服事，至2010年退下堂主任一職。\n\n\n80年代，他又與柴灣區其他教牧，投入爭取興建東區醫院運動。\n\n\n除了柴浸外，朱耀明又參與福音戒毒事工，成為基督教互愛中心董事及團牧。1998年，政府提出資助福音戒毒，但朱牧師認為，福音戒毒應仰靠教會支持，而非政府資助，最後互愛中心沒有向政府申請。後來，他更爭取讓成功福音戒毒的過來人，即使有案底也能擔任機構執照持有人。最後政府在2992年同意設「更生期」。此外，他又推動成立「基督教關懷無家者協會」，任首屆董事會主席。另外，又將自負盈虧的概念，應用在為戒毒者提供職業訓練的「基督教豐盛職業訓練中心」。\n\n\n1982年，朱耀明加入基督教協進會公共政策委員會，又加入「民主政制促進聯委會」（民促會），於1987及88年赴京，爭取八八直選。1989年，朱耀明積極投入香港基督教愛國民主運動，更成為香港市民支援中國民主運動聯席委員會常委。期間更領導「黃雀行動」，營救中國民運人士。\n\n\n1996年，基督教界內出現支持參與推選委員會及自籌國慶的主張，朱耀明堅持立場，提出反對。其中不少站在他對立面的，正是80年代一起爭取民主的教牧同工。\n\n\n1997年，朱耀明獲港督彭定康頒發英女皇榮譽勳章。\n\n\n1996至97年間，有聲明指由於朱耀明曾協助民運人士，故在1997年7月1日後將面對政治風險。為安全計，朱耀明乃於1997年6月離開香港。1998年5月，決定回到香港。\n\n\n2002年，香港民主發展網絡成立，成員包括教牧、學者及專業人士，朱耀明任主席。成立的目的，是希望為2007年實現一人一票普選特義，以及2008年普選立法會。期間，遇上香港政府就《基本法》廿三條（國家安全）立法爭議，朱耀明亦投入反廿三條立法的抗爭。同時，香港民主發展網絡亦推動公民教育。2004年全國人大公有，2007年香港不普選行政長官，2008年立法會的直選議席不變。朱耀明及香港中文大學社會學者陳健民等即成立「公民教育基金會」，繼續在民間推動政改和民主教育。\n\n\n2013年，香港大學法律學者戴耀廷倡議「用愛與和平佔領中環」運動，爭取「真普選」，陳健民及朱耀民成為共起人。2014年底，三人向警方自首。2016年4月17日，朱耀明獲得德國科隆福音派教區頒發Pfarrer-Georg-Fritze紀念獎，是首位華人奪有關榮譽。2019年4月9日，香港「佔中三子」被裁定「公眾妨擾」罪名成立。4月24日判刑，戴耀廷、陳健民、朱耀明被判監16個月，其中朱耀明因為身體狀況獲緩刑兩年。2020年，朱耀明移居台灣，完成回憶錄《敲鐘者言》。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Laidlaw Maxwell (1836.3.18-1921.3.6) was a missionary from Scotland. He graduated from the Medical School of the University of Edinburgh in 1858 and served at the General Hospital in Birmingham, England, qualifying as a doctor. In 1860, under the suggestion of Carstairs Douglas, a missionary of the English Presbyterian Church stationed in Xiamen, Maxwell was assigned to learn Minnan (Hokkien) Chinese. In the autumn of the same year, Maxwell and Douglas came to Taiwan for inspection. In May of the following year, they, along with Alexander Wylie and Chinese assistants Chen Zilu, Wu Jiazhi, and Wu Wenshui, went to Tainan to establish a church. Initially, they conducted medical missionary work in West Street in Tainan. However, they faced opposition from local gentry who incited attacks by the masses, accusing foreign doctors of killing Chinese people to extract brains and eyes for making opium. They then moved to Dagou (modern-day Kaohsiung) and established the first Presbyterian church in southern Taiwan. In 1865, Maxwell and William A. Pickering, a British customs officer in Anping, went to Tainan and Kaohsiung to evangelize to the Plains Indigenous people. Maxwell found that the Plains Indigenous people were more receptive to Christianity than the Han Chinese.\n\n馬雅各（James Laidlaw Maxwell，1836.3.18-1921.3.6）。宣教士，蘇格蘭人，1858年畢業於愛丁堡大學醫學院，並曾在英國伯明罕總醫院（General Hospital, Birmingham）服務，有醫生資格。1860年在廈門傳教的英國長老教會宣教士杜嘉德（Carstairs Douglas）1864年來到台灣滬尾（今淡水）考察，認為台灣既通行閩南語，應由駐廈門的教會前來設教，於是鼓吹母會差遣宣教士前去（賴永祥1990：273-274）。同年初，馬雅各受派到廈門，在此學習閩南語，並在秋天與杜嘉德來台考察，隔年5月與杜嘉德、魏理（Alexander Wylie）以及華人助手陳子路、吳嘉智、吳文水到台南開教。最初他們在台南看西街進行醫療傳教，但遭仕紳慫恿群眾攻擊，稱洋醫生殺害漢人取腦挖眼晴製造鴉片，後轉向打狗（今高雄）的旗後並在此設立南部首間長老教會（賴永祥1992：7-16；潘稀棋2004：57-61）。1865年他和安平海關官員英商必麒麟（W.A. Pickering）前往台南、高雄平埔族宣教，他發現平埔族較漢人容易接受基督教，\n\nAfter the uprising of Han Chinese communities in 1868, the focus of missionary work shifted to the Plains Indigenous peoples (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 20-21; Lin Jinshui, 118-112). Apart from pioneering the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, James Laidlaw Maxwell made two significant contributions: 1. Medical missionary work. Initially adopting a \"chapel cum clinic\" model in Dagou, he later opened medical clinics in Dagou, Fengshan, and Tainan, which eventually became the predecessors of the present-day Sin-Lau Hospital. Maxwell's medical skills at the time were truly remarkable, making him the pioneer of modern Western medicine in Taiwan (Lai Yongxiang, 1995: 1-4). Regarding medical missionary work, Maxwell put forward several perspectives: (1) Medical missions could promote scientific thinking and dispel superstitions; (2) They could demonstrate the integration of Christian action and doctrine; (3) They could be highly effective in spreading \"truth\"; (4) Work in pharmacies and hospitals was crucial in winning souls. Thus, he vigorously advocated for the combination of medicine and evangelism as the most powerful approach to missionary work (Maxwell, 1869: 112-113); 2. Translation and publication of the Vernacular Bible. In 1873, Maxwell and other missionaries translated and supervised the printing of the first Vernacular New Testament, titled *Lán ê Kiù-chú Iâ-so͘ Ki-tok ê sin-iok* (Our Savior Jesus Christ's New Testament), published in Glasgow. In 1884, the Old Testament was published under the title *Kü Iok ê Sèng Keng* (The Bible of the Old Testament) by the British Bible Society (Lai Yongxiang, 25). Vernacular script was educational at the time, enabling many illiterate individuals to learn to read within a short period, facilitating the reading of the Bible and other new knowledge. In 1880, he donated a set of Roman type printing presses to promote the use of the Vernacular script (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 73).\n\n1868年漢人群體教案四起後更是將宣教重點放在平埔族宣教（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：20-21；林金水118-112）。馬雅各的貢獻除了在於為英國長老教會開拓台灣傳教區以外，尚有兩項重點：1. 醫療傳道。初期他在旗後採「禮拜堂兼診所」模式，後陸續在此地、鳳山、府城（台南）開設醫館，即為今日新樓醫院前身。而馬雅各當時行醫的療效確實令時人震驚，可謂台灣近代西洋醫學鼻祖（賴永祥1995：1-4）。關於醫療傳道，馬雅各曾提出幾點看法：(1)醫療宣教能增進科學思維，打破迷信；(2) 能展示基督教行動與教義的結合；(3) 對傳播「真理」有莫大功效；(4) 在藥局和醫院的工作，是贏得靈魂的重要禾場。因此他大力鼓吹醫藥和傳道的結合是宣教工作最有力的途徑（Maxwell 1869: 112-113）；2. 翻譯與出版白話字聖經。1873年，馬雅各和其他宣教士譯妥並監印第一本閩南語白話字新約全書，名為Lán ê Kiù- chú Iâ-so͘ Ki-tok ê sin-iok（咱的救主耶穌基督的新約），在格拉斯哥出版；1884年則出版舊約，名為Kü Iok ê Sèng Keng（舊約的聖經），由英國聖經公會出版（賴永祥25）。白話字當時具教育功能，讓許多不識漢字的文盲能在短期內學會，以利閱讀聖經和其他新知，他在1880年捐贈一套羅馬字印刷機以推廣白話字的使用（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：73）。\n\n\n2)George Leslie Mackay (1844.3.21-1901.6.2), a missionary also known as Mackay Ruiru in Chinese, was of Scottish descent, born in Ontario, Canada, and passed away in Danshui, Taiwan. Inspired by William C. Burns during his childhood, he aspired to become a missionary. After studying theology at the University of Toronto and Princeton Theological Seminary, he returned to Canada for pastoral ministry. In September 1870, he applied to the Overseas Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada to become a missionary. The following year, he was ordained and arrived in Dagou (modern-day Kaohsiung), Taiwan, at the end of the year. Shortly after, he began his ministry in Danshui, expanding the church through itinerant evangelism. Over 29 years of missionary work in Taiwan, he established approximately 60 churches, many of which were in the Kavalan tribal areas of the Lanyang Plain, with 38 established by 1888 (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 86-90; Mackay, 2007: 3-14). Many descendants of the Kavalan tribe adopted the Chinese surname \"偕\" (Xie), in memory of Mackay, highlighting his significant influence at the time. Mackay made significant contributions to the Presbyterian Church in Canada's missions in Taiwan and the development of Presbyterian churches in northern Taiwan. He also laid down principles of localization and contextualization, particularly by actively nurturing local evangelists (Lin Jinshui, 163; Xie Dali, 303-313).\n\n馬偕（George Leslie Mackay，1844.3.21-1901.6.2），宣教士，漢名偕叡理，蘇格蘭裔，生於加拿大安大略省，卒於淡水。幼時受賓威廉（William C. Burns）感召，立志成為宣教士。先後在多倫多大學和普林斯頓神學院修習神學，後返回加拿大牧會，1870年9月向加拿大長老會海外宣道會申請成為海外宣教士，隔年被按立，年底從汕頭抵達打狗，稍後到淡水開教，並以巡迴宣教的方式拓展教會，其在台宣教29年總共建立約60間教會，其中不少是蘭陽平原噶瑪蘭族地區的教會，至1888年有38間（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：86-90；馬偕2007：3-14）。不少噶瑪蘭族後裔取漢姓「偕」，以紀念馬偕，足見其當時影響力。馬偕對加拿大長老教會在台宣教以及北台灣長老教會的發展貢獻甚鉅，也立下本土化和處境化的原則，尤其積極培養本地傳道人員（林金水163；謝大立303-313）。\n\nIn addition, Mackay made pioneering contributions in three areas that were groundbreaking for northern Taiwan and the church at that time:\n\n\n1. **Medical Evangelism and Introduction of Western Medicine**: Mackay not only laid the precedent of using medical care as a means of evangelism but also advocated for the study of Western medicine among his students. He collaborated with British Consulate physician Ringer, who supplied medications and raised funds. They rented a house next to Mackay's residence for medical practice. Later, they were joined by Jacob W. K. Fraser and C. H. Johansen in medical work. In 1880, with donations received, Mackay established the Hu-wei Clinic (formerly known as Danshui) next to the Danshui Church, the first Western clinic in the northern region. By 1890, it had treated 3,696 patients, ceasing operation after Mackay's death in 1901 (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 49-53).\n\n\n此外，馬偕還在三方面對當時北台灣和教會而言為創舉且帶來貢獻：1. 醫療傳道和引進西醫。他除了奠定以醫療為傳教途徑的先例，也在學生當中鼓吹學習西方醫學。此外他與英國領事侍醫林格（Ringer）合作，由其供應藥品並募捐基金，在馬偕寓所旁租屋行醫，後來又得華雅各（J.B. Fraser）和約翰生（C.H. Johansen）加入醫療工作。1880年馬偕得到捐款，在淡水教會旁開設滬尾（淡水舊名）偕醫館，是北部第一間西醫診所，1890當年達到3696名患者，至1901年馬偕過世後停止運作（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：49-53）；\n\n2. **Establishment of the \"Academy\" (later called Oxford College)**: In 1882, Mackay founded the \"Academy\" to provide education for the local people. The curriculum was not limited to theology and biblical knowledge but also included natural sciences, music, physical education, and other subjects, continuing the spirit of the Scottish Enlightenment movement embedded in Mackay's earlier mobile education initiative, the \"Roaming Academy.\"\n\n\n2. 1882年建立「理學堂大書院」（後稱牛津學堂）提供本地人教育，課程不限於神學和聖經知識，也包含自然科學、音樂、體育等科，延續稍早馬偕流動教育「逍遙學院」蘊含的蘇格蘭啟蒙運動精神；\n\n3. **Women's Education**: In 1884, the Danshui Girls' School was established. Besides practical considerations for missionary work, it had revolutionary significance for the advancement of women's knowledge and social status at that time.\n\n\n3. 女子教育。1884年設立淡水女學堂，除了有宣教工作的實際考量，但是對當時女性知識以及社會地位的提升而言具革命性的意義。\n\n\n3) Gao Chang (1837 - 1912.9.16). Born in Jinjiang County, Quanzhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, he passed away in the Tai Ping Jing Church in 1912. In 1864, he came to Tainan seeking employment. He later attended services at the Kanxi Street Chapel (now the Kanxi Street Church of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan) where he heard sermons and became acquainted with George Leslie Mackay. In 1866, he was baptized, becoming one of the first baptized believers of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan. After baptism, he studied under Wu Wenshui, an assistant to George Leslie Mackay, and soon aspired to become a preacher. He received training in the \"Believers' Training Class\" or \"Preachers' Training Class\" (the predecessor of Tainan Theological College) established by George Leslie Mackay to nurture local preachers. The classes were conducted in vernacular script (Romanized Hokkien) (Gao Junming, 2001:). In July 1867, Wu Wenshui and Gao Chang served as the first ministers of the Bitou Church. On April 11 of the following year, they were assaulted and injured by mobs in the \"Bitou Persecution Incident.\" They sought help from the authorities but were detained for fifty days. With the assistance of the British Consul in Hong Kong, sought by George Leslie Mackay, they were eventually released (Gao Junming, 2001: 26-36; Lai Yongxiang, 1992: 47-50).\n\n高長（1837 -1912.9.16）。生於福建省泉州府晉江縣，1912年卒於太平境教會。1864年到台南謀職，後在看西街禮拜堂（今台灣基督長老教會看西街教會）聽道並與馬雅各相識，於1866年受洗，為長老教會在台第一批受洗信徒之一。受洗後，向馬雅各的助手吳文水學道，未久立志傳道。他在馬雅各為培育本地籍傳道者而設立的「信徒造就班」或稱「傳道者養成班」（即台南神學院前身）接受訓練課，均是以白話字（閩南語羅馬字）進行（高俊明，2001：）。1867年7月，吳文水與高長擔任埤頭教會首任傳道師，隔年4月11日因教案「埤頭迫害事件」遭暴徒打受傷，向官府求助，反被關押五十天。在馬雅各尋求英國駐香港領事的協助下，才得以釋放（高俊明2001：26-36；賴永祥1992：47-50）。\n\n\nBetween 1870 and 1886, Gao Chang went to indigenous Paiwan tribes in Muzha, Kaohsiung (now Neimen District), Nantou, and other places to lead churches. In 1886, he and William Campbell went to Penghu for missionary work, becoming pioneers of Protestantism in Penghu. In 1889, Gao Chang returned to the Muzha Church for a period of 8 years. From early 1891 to the end of 1892, he was stationed at the Shihpai Chapel in the eastern region (now the Fuli Church of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan), crossing the Central Mountain Range at an advanced age. Among Gao Chang's descendants, five sons and three daughters, the eldest son (adopted) Gao Jinsheng (the fifth locally ordained pastor) and the second son Gao Duxing were both pastors. The third son, Gao Zaidé (the father of the renowned pastor Gao Junming), the fourth son Gao Zaiju (the father of Gao Yaodong, an early leader of the Assemblies of God in Taiwan), and the fifth son Gao Zaifu were all doctors. The eldest daughter, Gao Ajin, was the wife of a missionary, while the second daughter, Gao Xiuyuan, and the third daughter, Gao Xiuli, were both married to doctors (Gao Junming, 2001: 36). Gao Chang, besides being one of the first baptized members of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, was also the first local Protestant missionary. He was an early church pioneer for the Taiwan Presbyterian Church, and the network of believers formed by his descendants was of significant importance to the Taiwanese church.\n\n\n1870年到1886年期間，高長前往高雄木柵（今內門區）、南投等平埔族原住民部落帶領教會。1886年與甘為霖（William Campbell）到澎湖傳道，兩人為新教在澎湖開展的先驅。1889年，高長再駐木柵教會長達8年; 1891年初至1892年底，則駐於東部的石牌禮拜堂（今台灣基督長老教會富里教會），當時是以耳順之齡跨越中央山脈赴任。高長後代5男3女之中，長男（養子）高金聲（第5位被設立的本地籍牧師）與次男高篤行都是牧師；三男高再得（即是名牧高俊明之父）、四男高再祝（神召會在台早期領袖高耀東之父）、五男高再福都是醫師。長女高阿金為傳道之妻，次女高秀圓、三女高秀理均嫁予醫師（高俊明2001：36）。高長除了是台灣首批受洗長老教會信徒，也是首位本地新教傳道者，對台灣基督長老教會而言是早期教會開拓者，其後代構成的信徒家族網絡對台灣教會而言亦是意義非凡。\n\n\nWilliam Campbell (1841.4.11-1921.9.7) was a missionary born in Glasgow, Scotland, in the United Kingdom. After graduating from the University of Glasgow, he pursued theological studies at the Glasgow branch of the Free Church College, Glasgow (Campbell 2009: 1-4). In 1871, he arrived in Taiwan and soon began touring the indigenous Paiwan mission areas in Kaohsiung and Tainan, and in 1886, he expanded his work to Penghu (Pan Xiqi 2004: 53-57; Campbell 1874: 410-412). His main contributions include:\n\n\n甘為霖（William Campbell，1841.4.11-1921.9.7）。宣教士，生於英國蘇格蘭格拉斯哥，格拉斯哥大學畢業後，在蘇格蘭自由教會神學院格拉斯哥分校（Free Church College, Glasgow）修讀神學課程（甘為霖 2009：1-4）。1871年他抵達台灣，未久就進入高雄、台南平埔族宣教區巡視，1886年更是到澎湖開拓（潘稀棋2004：53-57；Campbell 1874: 410-412）。他的主要貢獻在於：\n\n1. Advancing special education for the visually impaired, earning him the title of \"Father of Blind Education in Taiwan.\" In 1884, he encountered a blind seeker in Yanqian, Tainan, who had been blinded by assailants, which inspired his concern for the visually impaired. He introduced the Romanized Braille system and produced several Braille books, including the Gospel of Matthew and catechism manuals, primarily sponsored by the British and Foreign Bible Society. He raised £525 for blind ministry through the Free Church Student Missionary Society in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n\n1.推動視障特殊教育，有台灣盲人教育之父稱譽。1884年他在台南岩前遇到被暴徒挖眼致盲的慕道者，啟發其對視障人士的關注。他引入羅馬拼音點字系統，並完成好些點字書籍，包含聖經馬太福音、教理問答手冊等，主要由英國及海外聖經公會（British  and Foreign Bible Society）負責。他向蘇格蘭格拉斯哥自由教會學徒傳道會（Free Church Student Missionary Society）籌募盲人事工款項525英鎊。\n\nIn 1891, he began renting Honggong Temple (Tainan Wen Chang Temple) as a blind school, named \"Xungu Tang,\" with a lease term of 5 years and an annual rent of 60 yuan. However, after Japan took over Taiwan, in 1900, Taiwan Governor-General Goto Shimpei ordered the establishment of the \"Tainan Benevolent Institute,\" with an attached education department to continue its work (Pan Xiqi 2004: 70-79; Lai Yongxiang 1990: 213-215; Campbell 2009: 246-251).\n\n\n1891年他開始租用洪公祠（台南文昌廟）為盲校，名為訓瞽堂，租期5年，每年租金60元。但日本領台後，1900年台灣總督兒玉源太郎命令指定「台南慈惠院」附設教育部門接續其工作（潘稀棋2004：70-79；賴永祥 1990：213-215；甘為霖 2009：246-251）；\n\nHe also compiled and translated documents and historical materials from the Dutch colonial period and organized the missionary history of Taiwan during the Dutch colonial period. This includes works like \"The Gospel of Matthew in Sinkang-Formosan, Dutch and English\" (1888), \"An Account of Missionary Success in Formosa\" (1889), \"The Article of Christian Instruction in Favorlang-English, Dutch and English\" (1896), \"Formosa Under the Dutch\" (1903), among others. Additionally, he authored other books such as \"Sketches From Formosa\" (1915), which was translated into Chinese as \"Sketches of Formosa: William Campbell's Taiwan Notes.\" William Campbell's contributions were substantial, and in 1915, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Theology degree by Knox College in Canada (Lai Yongxiang 1990: 108-113).\n\n\n2.編譯荷治時期文獻、史料和整理荷治時期台灣宣教歷史。包括《新港腔馬太福音傳》（The Gospel of Matthew in Sinkang-Formosan, Dutch and English, 1888）、《台灣佈教之成功》（An Account of Missionary Success in Formosa ,1889）、《法波蘭語信仰個條書》（The Article of Christian Instruction in Favorlang-English, Dutch and English, 1896）、《荷蘭統治下的福爾摩沙》（Formosa Under the Dutch, 1903）等。此外，他還著有其他書籍如《台灣素描》（ Sketches From Formosa, 1915，中文譯本《素描福爾摩沙：甘為霖台灣筆記》）。甘為霖著作等身，1915年獲加拿大諾克斯學院（Knox College）頒贈榮譽神學博士（賴永祥 1990：108-113）；\n\n\nHe also compiled a dictionary of Minnan Romanized script and promoted its use. Campbell compiled the \"Xiamen Phonetic New Dictionary,\" which drew information from the \"Kangxi Dictionary,\" \"Shiwuyin,\" \"English and Chinese Extempore,\" etc. Although it was named after Xiamen phonetics, it included a wide range of pronunciations from Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Taiwanese common dialects. Because his local assistants were Lin Jinsheng and Chen Daluo, it leaned closer to the Tainan accent (Lai Yongxiang 1990: 95-97; Pan Xiqi 2004: 141).\n\n\n3. 編纂閩南語白話字字典，推行白話字。甘為霖編纂《廈門音新字典》，資料來自《康熙字典》、《十五音》、《英華口才集》等，雖曰廈門音，但音廣泛取自漳泉台通用土音，並因本地助手為林錦生與陳大鑼，故較靠近台南腔調（賴永祥 1990：95-97；潘稀棋2004：141）。\n\n\n5) Thomas Barclay (1849.11.21-1935.10.5). Missionary, born in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, the Scottish Free Church Theological College, and Leipzig University in Germany. During his junior year, Barclay collaborated with John Campbell Gibson, who later also became a missionary, to measure the special dielectric induction of solvents. Their findings were included in William Thompson's thesis, leading to Barclay's name being published in the Encyclopedia Britannica. He arrived in Taiwan in 1875 and in 1877 merged the training classes for missionaries in Takao (modern-day Kaohsiung) and Tainan, calling it \"The University,\" which later became the precursor to Tainan Theological College, officially opening in 1880. Barclay served as its first principal (Pan Xiqi, 2003: 13-18, 29, 36-37).\n\n巴克禮（Thomas Barclay, 1849.11.21-1935.10.5）。宣教士，生於英國蘇格蘭格拉斯哥，在格拉斯哥大學、蘇格蘭自由教會神學院、德國萊比錫大學接受教育。巴克禮在大三時與日後亦成為宣教士的汲約翰（John Campbell Gibson）進行電介體（Dielectics）之特殊電感應溶量之測量，成果被列入William Thompson論文中，使其姓名被刊登在大英百科全書。1875年抵台，1877年將打狗和台南兩地的傳道者養成班合併，稱為「大學」，為台南神學院前身，於1880年正式開學，巴克禮擔任首任校長（潘稀棋2003：13-18、29、36-37）。\n\n\nHis contributions extended beyond education to include translating the Bible, promoting vernacular script, and publishing educational materials. He believed that Christians needed to study the Bible. Despite the success of Dutch missions in Taiwan in the 17th century, the loss of Christian faith after changes in political power occurred because the Bible had not been translated into the local language (only the Gospel of Matthew existed at that time). Recognizing that using Chinese characters would not be effective given the prevalence of illiteracy, he advocated for the use of vernacular script. Using Jacob May's donated printing press, Barclay personally traveled to England to study typesetting and printing. In 1884, he established the \"Gathered Treasures Hall,\" the origin of printing in Tainan. In 1894, the Presbyterian Church of England donated funds for the expansion of the printing press, which became a printing factory. In 1885, Barclay founded the first newspaper in Taiwan using vernacular script, the \"Taiwan Fucheng Church News,\" which was the precursor to the \"Taiwan Church News\" (Lai Yongxiang, 1990: 17-18, 59-60; Pan Xiqi, 2003: 64-65; Barclay, 2022: 180-181, 283-286). Additionally, in October 1895, during the Japanese army's preparations to besiege Tainan, Barclay and others, including Duncan Ferguson, met with General Nogi Maresuke to prevent bloodshed. As a result, Barclay was awarded the Fifth Class Order of the Rising Sun by Emperor Meiji in 1897, and the citizens of Tainan presented him with a scroll in gratitude (Pan Xiqi, 2003: 70-72; Barclay, 2022: 236-237).\n\n\n其貢獻除了教育，還在於翻譯聖經、推行白話字、文教出版。他認為基督徒需要研讀聖經，17世紀荷蘭在台宣教雖稱成功，但在政權交替後，基督教信仰流失，即是因為未將聖經譯為本地語言（當時僅有馬太福音）。他認為若以眼下文盲為眾的情況，使用漢字將無法達成目標，只有白話字可以。他以馬雅各奉獻的印刷機為器具，並自行赴英學習檢字、印刷，在1884年成立「聚珍堂」，為台南印刷業濫觴，1894年英國長老教會再為台灣教會印刷工作捐款，擴建為印刷廠。巴克禮在1885年創立以白話字印行的報紙《台灣府城教會報》，是台灣首份報紙，即是《台灣教會公報》前身（賴永祥1990：17-18、59-60；潘稀棋2003：64-65；巴克禮2022：180-181、283-286）。此外，他在1895年10月日軍準備圍攻台南府城之際，與宋忠堅（Duncan Ferguson）等人前往軍營會見乃木希典以避免流血事件發生，1897年他因此獲明治天皇頒五等旭日勳章，台南市民亦贈與卷軸以表感謝（潘稀棋2003：70-72；巴克禮 2022：236-237）。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang Cheng-tsung (March 25, 1886 - July 20, 1963), courtesy name Jianru, Christian name Huang Yilisha, was a social activist, businessman, and a foundational leader of the True Jesus Church in Taiwan. He graduated from Changhua First Public School in 1903 and from the National Language School of the Governor-General of Taiwan in 1907. From 1918 to 1923, he studied political economy at Waseda University in Japan. Huang actively participated in various social movements and was involved in the associations of Taiwanese students in Japan during his studies. In 1919, he joined the \"Enlightenment Society,\" which was reorganized into the \"New People's Society\" the following year, where he was elected as an officer. In 1921, he served as the General Affairs Officer of the \"Taiwan Youth Association\" and the General Affairs Director of the Tokyo headquarters of the \"Taiwan Magazine Company,\" the publishing organization for the association's magazine \"Taiwan Youth,\" which supported the petition movement for establishing the Taiwan Parliament.\n\n\n黃呈聰（1886.3.25-1963.7.20），字劍如，教名黃以利沙。社會運動者、商人、真耶穌教會在台奠基性角色之領袖。1903年彰化第一公學校畢業，1907年畢業於臺灣總督府國語學校，1918年至1923年赴日就讀早稻田大學政治經濟科。黃呈聰積極投身各項社會運動，在日求學期間活躍於台灣留日學生的結社活動，1919年加入「啟發會」，隔年啟發會改組為「新民會」，獲選為幹事，1921年任「臺灣青年會」總務幹事以及其機關刊物《台灣青年》的發行機構「臺灣雜誌社」東京本社總務主任，該組織乃支援臺灣議會設置請願運動。\n\n\nIn 1920, he was appointed the first village head of Xianxi Village in Taichung Prefecture. However, the following year, he co-signed a proposal with other village heads from Changhua, recommending to Governor-General Den Kenjiro to abolish the collective punishment system. Huang also expressed concerns about the social and economic issues under colonial rule in Taiwan and provided opinions on the cultural identity and future of Taiwan. Due to his active political involvement, his family was implicated, and his father, Huang Xiu, moved the entire family to Zhangzhou, Fujian (Deng Huien 2012: 17-37; Huang Songxian 2014: 47-54).\n\n1920年他被任命為台中州線西庄首任庄長，但隔年與彰化其他街庄長聯名，向總督田健次郎建議廢除實行連坐的保甲制度。此外，他也關心殖民統治下台灣社會、經濟問題，並對台灣文化定位以及台灣前途提出意見。由於黃呈聰積極參與政治，黃家人受到牽連，其父黃秀兩舉家遷至福建漳州（鄧慧恩2012：17-37；黃頌顯2014：47-54）。\n\n\nThe Huang family originally had a Presbyterian background, but during their time in China, Huang Chengchao converted to the True Jesus Church, influencing Huang Chengcong to also join the faith. In 1926, Huang Chengcong led eight people, including preachers from the church and Taiwanese who had converted in Fujian, to Taiwan to evangelize, resulting in the establishment of three churches. After converting to the True Jesus Church, Huang Chengcong frequently traveled between China and Taiwan, participated in the church's Nanjing Theological Seminary, and assisted with the 'Holy Spirit Times' newspaper. The sixth general assembly initiated a review of the church's origins, questioning the founding narrative of Zhang Barnabas, with Huang Chengcong being a key figure (Ye Xianqin, Cai Yanren 2020: 47).\n\n\n黃家原先為長老教會背景，但在中國期間，其弟黃呈超接受真耶穌教會信仰，黃呈聰受其影響而歸信。1926年黃呈聰率領該會傳道者以及在福建已歸信該會的台人加其共八人來台傳道，此行即建立三間教會。黃呈聰歸信真耶穌教會後不時往來兩岸，參加該會南京神學會，並曾協助《聖靈報》報務。第六次大會發起審查該會起源，對張巴拿巴的創會敘事提出質疑，黃呈聰亦為關鍵人物（葉先秦、蔡彥仁 2020：47）。\n\nFrom an external perspective, Huang Chengcong's contribution lies in promoting reform through participation in social and political movements, advocating a moderate cultural resistance to Japanese rule. Wakabayashi Masahiro pointed out that Huang Chengcong was a 'waiting faction' anti-Japanese activist of the local landlord bourgeoisie. The 'waiting faction' did not engage in direct combat with Japan but used modern knowledge to contribute to the construction of the 'motherland' (China), believing that once the 'motherland' became strong, the Taiwanese people would be liberated. This viewpoint expressed empathy for the negative situation in China at the time, temporarily setting aside expectations and waiting for changes in the circumstances (Wakabayashi Masahiro 1987: 41). From a religious perspective, he was a foundational figure in the evangelism of the True Jesus Church in Taiwan, playing significant roles in both its organization and theology.\n\n就教外角度而言，黃呈聰的貢獻在於藉著參與社會和政治運動推動改革，為溫和的文化抗日路線。若林正丈指出，黃呈聰是本地地主資產階級的「待機派」抗日份子，待機派意即不與日本直接戰鬥，而是用所學近代知識為「祖國」（中國）的建設效力，待「祖國」強大後，臺灣人才能得到解救。這種觀點對當時中國局勢的負面情況表示同理，暫時不予期待，等待時局變化（若林正丈1987：41）。就宗教角度而言，他是真耶穌教會在台傳教奠基者，在組織和神學上兼有之。\n\n\nIn 1949, due to the political situation, the True Jesus Church in Taiwan and mainland China lost contact. The True Jesus Church in Taiwan then took on a central and headquarters role, a foundational work significantly attributed to Huang Chengcong. He was also a key figure in the introduction of the True Jesus Church to Japan. For him, the establishment of the True Jesus Church by Chinese people was actually part of a national movement, symbolizing the restoration of the true faith in China. This meant that China would become the new center of global Christianity. He continued his spiritual longing for China through religious means (Deng Huien 2012: 44).\n\n\n1949年兩岸真耶穌教會因政治局勢失聯，台灣真耶穌教會得以隨即扮演中樞、總部角色，黃呈聰的奠基工作不可忽視。他也是真耶穌教會得以傳入日本的重要人物。而實際上，對其而言，中國人創立的真耶穌教會實為民族運動的一環，意即相信該會的創立象徵真道恢復於中國，因此中國成為世界基督教的新中心，他以宗教的方式延續心靈對中國的嚮往（鄧慧恩2012：44）。\n\nInosuke Inoue (1882.9.2-1966.6.20), whose Chinese name is Gao Tianming. Physician, evangelist, and early mountain evangelist in Taiwan. In 1900, he studied at the Evening Department of Daeseong Gakukan, and from 1905 to 1907, he studied at the Holy Book School of the Oriental Missionary Society. His father was killed by the Taroko aborigines in the Hualien Mountains of Taiwan in 1906. After a religious experience, he realized that \"the best way to get revenge is to use love to overcome evil\", and he determined to go to Taiwan to preach to the aborigines. However, the Japanese government's \"Libo Policy\" at that time was planning to \"Shintoize\" the religious beliefs of the indigenous peoples, and therefore prohibited any missionaries from entering the indigenous tribes to preach Christianity. Inoue decided to use medical treatment as a cover to facilitate his missionary work, so he entered Izu Toda Hoxuedo Hospital in 1910 to engage in medical research and internship. He obtained a medical certificate in 1911, arrived in Taiwan in the same year, and entered the Hsinchu Galapai tribe as a mountain entrustment. Returned home due to illness.\n\n\n井上伊之助（Inosuke Inoue, 1882.9.2-1966.6.20），漢名高天命。醫師、傳道者，台灣早期進行山地傳道者。1900年就讀大成學館夜間部，1905年至1907年就讀東洋宣教會聖書學院，。其父1906年在台灣花蓮山區被太魯閣族原住民殺害，後在一宗教經驗中體悟「最好的報復方式，就是用愛勝過惡」，遂立志到台灣向原住民宣教。惟當時日本政府的「理蕃政策」，正計畫將原住民的宗教信仰「神道化」，因此禁止任何傳道者進入原住民部落傳基督教。井上決定以醫療方式為掩護以利傳教，故此1910年入伊豆戶田寶血堂醫院從事醫學研究和實習，1911年取得醫師證，同年抵台，以山地囑託身份進入新竹加拉排部落，後因病回國。\n\nIn 1922, he returned to Taiwan and was appointed as a missionary for the Japanese Christian Church in Hsinchu City. He also went on itinerant missions in the mountain areas, entering indigenous tribes again in 1926 and 1931 (Inoue Inosuke 2016: 42-45, 324-328). During his time in Taiwan, Inoue continuously advocated for the evangelization and education of the indigenous people. For example, at the joint prayer meetings in Taipei in December 1923 and January 1924, he not only reaffirmed that he had come for the indigenous people but also argued that since the Japanese were good at imitation, they should learn from other countries' efforts to evangelize foreigners and different races. He criticized the fact that, despite Japan having several colonies at the time, Japanese Christians had never devised a plan to evangelize the people in those colonies (Inoue Inosuke 2016: 149-152).\n\n\n1922年再度來台，被任命為新竹市日本基督教會傳道，並前往山地巡迴傳道，1926年、1931年再次進入原住民部落（井上伊之助2016：42-45、324-328）。井上在台期間不斷呼籲以傳教教化原住民，例如在1923年12月和1924年1月的台北聯合祈禱會上，他不但重申自己乃為原住民而來，且主張日本人既然善於模仿，就應學習他國向外國人和不同種族傳教，並斥責日本今時已有幾處殖民地，日本基督徒卻不曾擬定向其人民傳道的計畫（井上伊之助2016：149-152）。\n\n\nAfter the war, he continued to stay in Taiwan until returning to Japan in 1947, where he worked as a university lecturer and engaged in missionary activities. Inoue Inosuke is known as the \"Father of Medical Care and Missionary Work for Taiwan's Indigenous People.\" His work \"Notes on the Savages\" serves as a primary resource for the study of indigenous people, especially valuable as an ethnographic account that documents the headhunting culture. It also reflects his differing views on Japan's policies towards the indigenous peoples—advocating against punitive expeditions, non-violence, religious assimilation, and the independence and autonomy of indigenous peoples. This marks him as a human rights activist with tendencies towards Christian socialism or cosmopolitanism (Liu Shu-chin 2019: 152). Starting in 1928, Inoue used book reviews in newspapers and the latest media, such as radio stations, to promote the ideas in \"Notes on the Savages.\" In April 1929, his long-term struggle at the fringes of the law ended when he was severely punished for broadcasting \"Notes on the Savages\" on the radio, resulting in his suspension and the cessation of his work in mountain regions (Liu Shu-chin 2019: 155).\n\n\n戰後他繼續留在台灣直到1947年始返日，擔任大學講師並進行傳道工作。井上伊之助被稱為「臺灣原住民醫療與宣教之父」，其著作《生蕃記》為原住民研究的第一手資料，尤為再現馘首文化的珍貴風俗誌，並反映對日本理蕃政策的不同意見──反討蕃、不流血、宗教同化、原住民族獨立自主主義，也表明其為基督教社會主義或世界主義傾向的人權運動者（柳書琴2019：152）。1928 年起，井上利用報紙書評或最新媒體電臺，宣揚《生蕃記》相關理念。1929 年4 月，他在法制邊緣的長期遊戰，終因在電臺廣播《生蕃記》一事遭嚴重處分，勒令停職，中止其山地事務（柳書琴2019：155）。\n\n\nKuniyuki Itō believes that Inoue Inosuke's representation of the indigenous people transcended the racist perspectives of his time. Inoue abolished the term \"savages\" and popularized the term \"Takasago tribe.\" He approached indigenous customs from a relatively objective standpoint, positively evaluating their principles of fair distribution, gender equality, and notions of chastity. Furthermore, he described Inoue Inosuke as a \"sacrificial offering\" to ease the animosity between the Chinese (including Taiwanese) and the Japanese (Inoue Inosuke 2016: 336-337, 341).\n\n\n伊藤邦幸認為井上伊之助對原住民的再現，跳脫當時的種族主義視角，他廢止「生蕃」一詞，普及「高砂族」之稱，並以相對客觀的立場看待原住民習俗，對於公平分配、男女平等、貞操觀念給予正面評價。他更形容井上伊之助為緩和中國人（包括臺灣人）和日本人之間仇怨的「祭品」（井上伊之助2016：336-337、341）。\n\n\n3) Juji Nakada (November 20, 1870 - September 24, 1939) was a pastor, businessman, journalist, and revivalist. From 1888 to 1892, he studied in the theology department at Tokyo Eiwa School (the predecessor of Aoyama Gakuin University). In 1896, he went to the United States to study at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. During his time in the U.S., he met Reverend Charles E. Cowman of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1901, the Cowmans and Nakada established the \"Central Gospel Mission\" in Tokyo, later founding the \"Tokyo Bible Institute\" and the \"Oriental Missionary Society.\" In 1917, Nakada founded the Japan Holiness Church. The Oriental Missionary Society was an overseas missionary organization with mission fields throughout East Asia, South Asia, Central America, South America, and Europe.\n\n\n中田重治（Juji Nakada, 1870.11.20- 1939.9.24），牧師、商人、新聞工作者、奮興主義者。1888年-1892年在東京英和學校（青山學院前身）神學部就讀，1896年負笈美國芝加哥慕迪聖經學院。在美期間在恩惠衛理公會衛理公會認識牧師高滿（Charles E. Cowman），1901年高滿夫婦與中田在日本東京建立「中央福音傳道館」，而後創設「東京聖經學院」、「遠東宣教會」，1917年創立日本聖潔教會。「遠東宣教會」為一海外宣教團體，宣教範圍遍及東亞、南亞、中美、南美、歐洲。\n\n\nIn January 1926, Nakada advocated at the Tokyo Bible Institute that the time was ripe for missionary work in Taiwan and called for efforts to pioneer the mission. On the 11th of the same month, he and Fujio Abe traveled from Tokyo to Kobe and then took a ship to Keelung, where they were greeted by Inoue Inosuke, Kameyama, Chen Fangben, and Chen Xizhen on the dock. They then embarked on a preaching tour of the entire western part of the island, holding meetings primarily in Presbyterian church chapels. Nakada's visit not only officially initiated the Holiness Church's work in Taiwan but also laid the foundation for its future development there (Chen Zhubei 1989). Nakada's main contribution was introducing the Japanese Holiness Church, which combined the Holiness Movement and the beliefs of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and establishing the Taiwan Holiness Church. This diversified the Protestant presence in Taiwan, which had previously been largely monopolized by the Japanese Anglican Church that mainly targeted Japanese believers.\n\n\n1926年1月中田在東京聖經學院主張台灣傳道時機已然成熟，呼籲前往開拓，同月11日他和安部藤夫從東京到神戶，再搭船到基隆，井上伊之助、龜山、陳芳本、陳溪圳在基隆岸上迎接，之後作全島西部巡迴佈道，聚會多在長老教會禮拜堂舉行。中田此行不但正式開拓聖教會在台灣的工作，也奠定該會日後在台灣發展的根基（陳主培1989）。中田的主要貢獻在於引進揉合聖潔運動和宣道會信仰的日本聖潔教會並設立台灣聖教會，讓台灣的新教市場不再一元，雖稍早有日本聖公會傳入，但以日人信徒為其對象。\n\nSince then, a denomination in Taiwan has upheld Amyraldism, enriching Taiwan's theological landscape and adding to its theological diversity. The \"Far Eastern Mission\" it established also founded Taiwan's first post-war seminary, the \"Central Taiwan Theological Seminary,\" which trained many local ministers. However, Nakada and the Holy Church's efforts to attract Presbyterian Church members led to friction between the two. Lai Ren-Sheng, a preacher who had joined the Holy Church and later returned to the Presbyterian Church, once wrote articles criticizing the Holy Church and Nakada (Lai Ren-Sheng 1934: 4-5; Lai Ren-Sheng 1934: 2-3).\n\n從此台灣存在持亞米念主義的宗派，無異豐富台灣的神學景觀，增添神學多元性。其創立的「遠東宣教會」也創立了台灣在戰後的第一間神學院「中台神學院」，培養許多本地傳道者。不過，中田和聖教會對長老教會信徒的拉攏，使得長老教會與其發生芥蒂，曾改入聖教會後回到長老教會的傳道者賴仁聲即曾撰文批評該會和中田（賴仁聲 1934：4-5；賴仁聲 1934：2-3）。\n\nThomas Barclay (1849-1935) was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in England in 1921. In 1925, the Bible Society decided to revise the Pe̍h-ōe-jī Old Testament in the Amoy dialect, considering Barclay's earlier success in translating the New Testament. He was appointed to undertake this task. Barclay first returned to his home country to rest, and in the spring of 1927, he arrived in Amoy to begin the revision. The work was completed on December 30, 1930, and handed over to the Commercial Press in Shanghai for printing. However, in 1932, the January 28 Incident occurred in Shanghai, and the Commercial Press was bombed by the Japanese, destroying all printed copies of the Old Testament, nullifying his efforts. Fortunately, Barclay had made an additional copy of the manuscript, thus avoiding a total loss of his work. After returning to Taiwan, Barclay continued to frequently correspond with Shanghai, inquiring about the resumption of printing.\n\n巴克禮（Thomas Barclay, 1849-1935），巴克禮1921年獲選英國長老教會總會議長。1925年聖經公會決定改譯廈門音舊約白話字聖經，因念及巴克禮稍早翻譯新約之成效，故聘其擔任此項工作。巴克禮先回國休息，1927年春到廈門著手改譯，至1930年12月30日完成改譯工作，交付上海商務印書館印刷。未料1932年上海發生一二八事變，商務印書館被日本轟炸，所印舊約悉數毀於戰火，其工作成果化為烏有。幸而巴克禮之前另抄一份原稿，始避免前功盡棄。巴克禮回台後，仍不時馳函上海打探消息，詢問復工時間。\n\n\nIn October 1932, Barclay personally traveled to Shanghai to seek a resolution, which ultimately succeeded. The printing work was completed on August 4, 1933, and on December 25, he received the printed Old Testament. With this, Barclay's revision of the Pe̍h-ōe-jī Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, was finally completed. This Bible was widely circulated among Hokkien speakers in Taiwan, Fujian, and Southeast Asia for a long time.\n\n\nIn addition, Barclay supplemented the \"Chinese-English Dictionary of the Amoy Vernacular\" edited by Carstairs Douglas. As fifty years had passed since its publication, many new characters and scientific terms were not included and needed supplementation. For this, Barclay requested the mission board to send preacher Yang Shiyang to Tainan to assist. In May 1922, the two went to Shanghai to work on the supplements and simultaneously proofread the printing manuscript. In 1923, the \"Supplement to Dictionary Amoy Vernacular\" was published by the Commercial Press (Taiwan Presbyterian Church General Assembly History Committee 1965: 136-137; Ikawa Naoya 1936: 81-85). Barclay's work in revising the Bible and editing the dictionary holds significance beyond the religious sphere, making important contributions to Taiwanese literature.\n\n\n1932年10月巴克禮親自前往上海尋求解決，終得順利進行，於1933年8月4日印刷工作告一段落，12月25日收到印妥之舊約聖經。至此，巴克禮從創世記到啟示錄的白話字聖經改譯工作終告完成，此本聖經在台灣、福建、東南亞閩南語使用者之中流通甚廣，時間亦久。此外，巴克禮亦增補杜嘉德（Carstairs Douglas）編著之《廈門音漢英大辭典》，乃因本辭典付梓經過五十年，其間許多新字和科學用詞未收其中，需要增補。巴克禮為此向傳道局請求派傳道師楊士養至台南協助。1922年5月兩人前往上海進行增補工作並同時校對印刷原稿，1923年《廈門音漢英大辭典增補版》（Supplement to Dictionary Amoy Vernacular）於商務印書館出版（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：136-137；井川直衛1936：81-85）。巴克禮改譯聖經、編修辭典，其意義不僅限於宗教層面，對台灣文學亦有重要貢獻。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic missions:Catholic missions in Manchuria were led by the Missions Etrangères de Paris. Because the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Manchuria was not yet recognized as a diocese, but rather as an Apostolic Vicariate (essentially a diocese in training), the head of each jurisdiction was first named a de jure bishop of a defunct diocese elsewhere in the world. This titular appointment was purely a formality in order to give the appointment the rank of bishop. I do not add them here, but they do appear in official biographies. The official title of a de facto bishop of a Apostolic Vicariate is an Vicar Apostolic. In 1898, the Catholic jurisdiction was split into Manchuria and South Manchuria.\n\n\nBishop Emmanuel-Jean-François Verrolles: 方濟各 / 吳樂爾 (1805-1878)\n\nBorn in Bayonne, France, in 1805. Ordained in 1828 and joined the Société des Missions Etrangères in 1830. Verrolles’ entire missionary career was spent in China. From 1831-1837, he was a mission priest in Muping 穆坪, located in the far west of Sichuan. In 1838, he was placed in charge of the new Apostolic Vicarage of Manchuria and Mongolia, later changed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Manchuria after Mongolia was returned to the jurisdiction of the vicariate of Beijing. Seeking a physical home for the new mission, Verrolles purchased a piece of land in the village of Bajiazi 八家子 near Tieling 铁岭 for the construction of a church and presbytery. Bajiazi already had a few hundred Catholics and would remain one of the key concentrations of Catholics in Manchuria. A second church at Yangguan 阳关 would serve as his residence.\n\n\nVerrolles traveled twice to Europe to seek political and papal support for the new mission. Beyond resources, he sought to ensure against the further erosion of territory of the sort that had placed Mongolia under the jurisdiction of Beijing. Verrolles was well received by Pope Pius IX as well as in the French court, having been offered an arch-bishopric by King Louis-Philippe and receiving an annuity of three thousand francs from Prince Louis-Napoleon.\n\n\nVerrolles oversaw the transition to the new era following the treaties of Tianjin and Beijing (1858-1860), which gave missionaries the freedom to travel and preach openly in China. He sent priests out across Manchuria, particularly to non-Han areas of the north as well as into Siberia. His successes invited conflict with the more recently-arrived Protestants, who made him the subject of satirical articles in the local press. Verrolles died in 1878 and was interred in Yingzi (Yingkou). Following his death, his residence at Yangguan was repurposed as a seminary.\n\n\nBishop Laurent Guillon 紀 M.E.P. (1854-1900)\n\nBorn 1854 in Aix-en-Provence, France. Ordained in 1877, having already joined the Société des Missions Etrangères while still in seminary. Guillon departed for Manchuria in 1878 and studied Chinese language at the seminary in Yangguan. He was struck ill twice, once by smallpox in 1880, and again by typhoid in 1882.\n\n\nIn 1889, Guillon was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Manchuria. He succeeded the brief tenure of two predecessors, Constant Dubail, M.E.P., and Louis-Hippolyte-Aristide Raguit, M.E.P., each of whom had died soon after taking office. An energetic administrator, Guillon quickly grew the number of Catholics and Catholic mission in the territory. Besides sending priests on rounds to deliver sacraments to far-flung Catholic villages, Guillon placed particular emphasis on developing Catholic social institutions such as orphanages, schools and dispensaries. This strategy aimed to counter the successes of the Protestant missions, with whom Catholic relations were strained. Guillon oversaw the Catholic mission response to the 1894-1895 Sino-Japanese War, the first phase of the ongoing military crisis that would engulf the region. \n\n\nIn 1898, Guillon petitioned successfully for the region to be divided into two Apostolic Vicariates, Southern Manchuria and Manchuria, corresponding roughly to the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, respectively (Heilongjiang was still aspirational, it would in 1931 become the Apostolic Prefecture of Qiqihar, essentially an aspirational Apostolic Vicariate designated specifically for evangelization). Guillon remained Vicar Apostolic of Liaoning, which at the time of separation had 23 missionaries, 8 indigenous priests, 115 catechists, and 20,050 Catholics.\n\n\nGuillon held the position of Vicar Apostolic at the time of the Boxer Uprising. He remained at his post in Mukden and was killed during an assault on the cathedral in 1900.\n\n\nBishop Pierre-Marie-François Lalouyer M.E.P. 藍祿葉 (1850-1923)\n\nBorn in 1850 in Rennes, France. Joined Société des Missions Etrangères in 1871 and was ordained priest of the society in 1873. Later that same year, he arrived in the port city of Niuzhuang and was dispatched by Emmanuel Verrolles to begin study of Chinese language at Yangguan. In 1874, Lalouyer was given a position in the Mukden seminary, and in 1889 was placed in charge of the seminary at Chaling. In between these two positions, he was head of the parish of Mukden and sent to a district on the western coast of Liaodong.\n\n\nIn 1897, Lalouyer was named coadjutor along with Guillon of the Apostolic Vicariate of Manchuria and sent to the northern city of Jilin, where he purchased a piece of land for a house. This was in preparation for the subsequent (1898) division of Manchuria into two Apostolic Vicariates, Southern Manchuria and Manchuria, with Lalouyer being placed in charge of the former.\n\n\nProtestant missions:Protestant leadership came from the Scottish and Irish missions, later joined by British, American, and Swedish missions. The Scottish and Irish joined in 1885 into the Presbytery of Manchuria, often simply referred to as the Union, which would remain the umbrella organization for all Protestant efforts moving forward. \n\n\nWilliam C. Burns (1815-1868) \n\nBurns was the pioneer Protestant missionary to Manchuria. \n\nAn energetic evangelist, Burns was deeply connected to the revivalist movement, having experienced a moment of personal inspiration at a revival meeting during his early twenties that convinced him of a personal calling from God. Burns’ career had already taken him through his native Scotland, Britain, Ireland and Canada before he was sent by the English Presbyterian Church on mission in China in 1847. Burns first encountered the Chinese language on his shipboard journey to Hong Kong, eventually becoming sufficiently proficient to pen a Chinese translation of the 17th–century Christian tract, the Pilgrim’s Progress. Like his evangelical wanderings, Burns travelled frequently rather than remaining within one mission station, gradually moving north from Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou and Beijing before settling in the Manchurian port town of Niuzhuang in 1867.\n\n\nIn that year, Burns appealed to the English Presbyterian Mission board to add the region to the work of the mission. That successful appeal took on the additional tenor of a dying wish, as Burns died after a brief illness the subsequent year. Subsequent missionary writings portray Burns and his call to mission in highly reverential terms. (Boyd, 53-54)\n\n\nDugald Christie (1855-1936)\n\nThe first and most important medical missionary to Manchuria.\n\n\nBorn in Scotland, Christie trained at the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, receiving both qualifications in 1881. The subsequent year, he was sent to Manchuria, volunteering to leave the more comfortable foreign enclave in the port city of Niuzhuang and instead move upcountry to the city of Mukden (Shenyang) where he opened a small dispensary that by 1884 had grown into a twelve-bed hospital. In his memoir, Christie describes significant resistance to Western medicine, including patients who assumed nefarious intent from the drugs stocked in the clinic, fears that he attributed to rumors started by Chinese doctors. Christie describes an incident during the Sino-French Tonkin war of 1884 in which a French Catholic priest visited the clinic, igniting rumors that visitor’s long black robe concealed a child which was to be sacrificed for its eyes and heart. Despite these setbacks, the clinic continued to train local Chinese assistants and in 1892 enrolled its first class of medical students as the Shengching (Shengjing, another name for Shenyang) Medical School. (Thirty Years in Moukden, pp. 5-6)\n\n\nHaving established this foundation, both the hospital and Christie’s career as a medical missionary would later take off in more dramatic form in response to later public health crises, particularly the outbreak of pneumonic plague in 1910.\n\n\nJohn Ross (1842–1915) 羅約翰\n\nRaised in a Gaelic-speaking area of northern Scotland, Ross served several local churches before leaving for China under the United Presbyterian Church in 1872.\n\n\nRoss was based initially in Yingkou and later moved to Shenyang, where he became active evangelizing to the local Korean community. He would complete the first Korean-language translation of the New Testament that was widely used in Korea, as well as Korean language primers and an English-language history of Korea for use by later missionaries.\n\n\nRoss was known for being an institution-builder, raising funds for the Dongguan church outside of the then city walls of Shenyang. That church was a center of the Korean Christian community in Shenyang. It was damaged in the Boxer violence, but subsequently rebuilt. In his writing, he encourages a mission strategy based on the acceptance of Chinese religions and practices. He returned to Scotland in 1910 and died in 1915.\n\n\nWang Jingming, aka “Old Wang” (c. 1840–1885) \n\nDescribed in contemporary publications as the first Chinese evangelist in Manchuria, “old Wang” was both an actual figure and an embodiment of the Protestant ideal of successful conversion. According to John Ross, Wang was “the first baptized, the first preacher set apart, and the first elder ordained by the writer.” (5)\n\n\nAccounts of Old Wang’s life are fairly stylized, the longest being in a pamphlet by John Ross. This account presents Wang as a sincere convert, not always sophisticated in his understanding of the Christian teaching, but with a burning desire to preach to any who would listen (and some who would not). Matching well the Pauline model of heartfelt spiritual transformation, Old Wang embodied the ideals of Protestant mission in Manchuria. Wang was born in a village near Beijing, given a basic education but insufficient land to make a living as a farmer. He worked in various trades in Jilin and Niuzhuang, where he took up smoking opium. In 1873, Wang happened upon a copy of a gospel which intrigued him to regularly come and hear the preaching and catechisms of the Protestant mission. He soon converted and remained insatiable in his desire to understand the scriptures, a “diligent student of the truth, though not a remarkable bright one.” For the remainder of his life, Wang was an unquenchable evangelist, distilling the essence of the gospel in his heart and relating it in a manner that the poor in his own country could understand and appreciate, a process that marked the transition from mission to native church. In 1884, Wang became ill and after a period under the care of the mission. He died at roughly the age of 40.\n\n\nA similar life trajectory of a figure nicknamed “Blind Chang” also appears in tracts of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic mission:Bishop Pierre-Marie-François Lalouyer M.E.P. 藍祿葉 (1850-1923)\n\n(Continued from previous decade)\n\n\nHaving promoted the division of the Manchuria VA into two sections, Lalouyer continued on as bishop of the northern region, centered in Jilin and including Heilongjiang. He was thus in Jilin (city) at the outbreak of the Boxer violence, which reached both Manchuria VAs in June of 1900. The next month he and two priests (the entirety of the mission) sought refuge at the Russian (not sure what it was, sources call it a “colony”) at Guanchengzi (Changchun) and from there followed the evacuation of civilians towards Russian territory and eventually on a circuitous water route through Harbin, Vladivostok, Japan and finally back to the Manchurian port of Yingkou and eventually by train back to Jilin, where the new church had indeed been destroyed.  \n\n\nIn the aftermath and using indemnities paid by the Chinese government, Lalouyer began an aggressive period of construction in Jilin. In 1903, the town consecrated the Sacré-Coeur church in Jilin. Followed soon after by the foundation of Catholic villages Saint Joseph and l'Etoile de la mer near the newly founded town (remember that this is all a frontier region) of Tongken. He also enlarged the small seminary in Qiqihar.\n\n\nFélix Choulet M.E.P. 1850-1923蘇\n\nBorn in Chambéry, France, in 1850. Joined the M.E.P. in 1877 and ordained as a priest in the order in 1880.\n\n\nChoulet arrived in Niuzhuang via Shanghai in 1880 and worked for a few years at the Chaling seminary, where he also studied Chinese language. He spent three years in charge of a large district in Liaoning, bordering Jilin on the north and spanning Korea to Mongolia east to west.   Following this, he was again placed in charge of a seminary and a church district, where he proved able an able administrator especially talented at finding funds for construction projects. \n\n\nIn 1900 Choulet was placed in charge of Niuzhuang and was in the process of rebuilding the church building when the Boxer violence broke out. Choulet learned piecemeal of the deaths of Guillon, nine priests and thousands of Chinese Catholics, as well as the looting of church buildings and residences, to the point that “there was no church, residence or school in the entire mission and most of the Christians have their houses burned or demolished.” (Biography: https://irfa.paris/en/missionnaire/1466-choulet-felix/)\n\n\nIt was in this condition that he was appointed VA of Southern Manchuria in 1901. He painted a bleak picture of the mission “We have a foothold in around ten stations. We still have, at the port of Newchanwang, two churches and an oratory: that is our entire fortune. Everywhere else, we are established on the domain of others. The Seminary occupies a rented house, and it is in houses belonging to pagans that our orphanages are installed.” (Biography: https://irfa.paris/en/missionnaire/1466-choulet-felix/) In 1901 he went to Beijing to discuss compensation (with the French legation) from the Chinese government, returning in 1902 with optimism for a new period of expansion and rebuilding. (The post-Boxer optimism was shared across missions). The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 was another period of uncertainty for the missions, but the Japanese victory left Choulet optimistic, as he was convinced that Japan was a better partner than Russia. \n\n\nProtestant missions\n\n\nDugald Christie 1855-1936\n\nChristie was born in Scotland in 1855. He received his qualifications as a doctor and surgeon in 1881. The following year he went to Mukden as a medical missionary and opened the Shengjing Clinic that among much else specialized in cataract surgery (which was mobilized as a metaphor for seeing the light of Christ). For the next 30 years Christie ran the clinic and worked towards opening a full medical school; with funds from Scottish and Irish presbyterian churches, the Chinese government and local people, the clinic became a (teaching) hospital and in March 1912 Christie became the first Principal of the Mukden Medical College. This was the first foreign medical college to be opened in northeastern China. \n\nChristie retired in 1923 and died in Edinburgh in 1936. \n\n\nThomas C. Fulton, 1855-1942\n\nBorn in Northern Ireland and educated at Queen’s College, Belfast. Fulton arrived to Manchuria in 1884 and stationed at Yingkou. Typical of his generation, he spread his efforts over a wide area, never spending much time in one place, and instead concentrating on opening as many stations and churches as possible. In 1899, he joined the staff of Union Theological College, Mukden, and spent most of the rest of his missionary career in theological education. He retired in 1941 and died the following year.\n\n\n\n\nBishop Auguste-Ernest-Désiré-Marie Gaspais, M.E.P.\n\nBorn in 1856 in Vannes, France, Auguste Gaspais joined the Société des Missions Etrangères in 1903 and was ordained a priest of the order in 1905. He arrived in Manchuria in 1908. From 1908-1920, he was placed in charge of a series of far-flung churches. In 1920, he was named Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of Northern Manchuria, and in 1923 the sole Vicar Apostolic.  \n\n\nDuring the 1920s, Gaspais oversaw the significant expansion of the Catholic Church, in terms of converts, institutions, and territory. These successes were despite the declining state of internal security, which created significant practical difficulties for communication. In contrast, Gaspais seemed to maintain good relations with public authorities, a talent that would continue to serve him in the future. \n\n\nAs Japanese influence grew throughout the decade, Gaspais came to view Japan not so much as an aggressor as a guarantor of safety, preferable to the predations of bandits and especially important as a bulwark against the baleful influence of the Soviet Union. These early experiences shaped how Gaspais would deal with the formation of the Japanese client state of Manchoukuo during the subsequent years. \n\n\nBishop Jean-Marie Blois, MEP, 1881-1946\n\nBorn in Nantes in 1881 and ordained to the MEP in 1905. Arrived in Mukden 1905 and placed in charge of church construction and work as parish priest. Returned briefly to France in 1919 to take up position as director of Paris Seminary, but was subsequently brought back to China in 1921 as VA of Mukden.\n\n\nDespite the atmosphere of political and military uncertainty, Blois was concerned during this decade with institution building. Achievements in this regard include the French-Chinese college, which was founded in 1923 and subsequently handed over to the Marists, and a smaller school for catechists that opened in 1924. He also sought to expand the mission beyond the MEP, inviting Catholic missionaries from Quebec and the United States to take up territories that were later detached from Mukden. \n\n\nBlois also oversaw the internationalization of the Catholic mission, using land granted from Japanese Christians in Fushun and Dalian/Dairen to build churches for the foreign (Japanese, Korean and European) Catholic communities. Although new church construction was prohibited after 1927, Dalian was able to rebuild the Francis-Xavier parish church into a such a community, served by a Japanese-speaking missionary priest. (I am not sure about Fushun)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic\n\n\nBishop Auguste-Ernest-Désiré-Marie Gaspais, M.E.P.\n\nHaving been installed as VA of Jilin in 1923, Gaspais was at the center of the various crises of the 1930s, including the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, the formation of Manchukuo (capital at nearby Changchun, renamed Xinjing), and the subsequent political crises involving the place of Catholicism in the new, highly engineered state. In 1934 Gaspais founded a new seminary in the Manchukuo capital of Xinjing. In 1940, this seminary was handed over to the Assumptionist order for operation. The seminary opened with an enrolment of about 50 students.\n\n\nOn the whole, Gaspais’ attitude towards Japan was cautious. He was by no means a booster for the new state, but was willing to deal with its authorities as the chief representative of the Church (as in a 1934 meeting of Manchukuo religious leaders in Changchun). He is best remembered for his role in advocating for the acceptance of political and familial rites in the lives of Catholics, convincing the Holy See to reverse its centuries-old decision to ban Chinese Catholics from participating in ancestral or Confucian rites (and the definition of the latter as idolatry). This advocacy was in response to increasing role of public rites in the life of Manchukuo, including a legal instruction to maintain a Shinto shrine in classrooms, rites for the Manchukuo and Japanese emperors, and rites for the war dead. It mirrored crises in Japan, specifically one involving students at Catholic Sophia University in Tokyo\n\n\nJean-Marie-Michel Blois, M.E.P.\n\nBlois continued to act in his role as VA of Mukden. He does appear to have been less enthusiastic than Gaspais about cooperating with the new state, but that may simply be a virtue of distance from the new capital. There is no particular evidence either way about his support or condemnation of Japan. His notable achievements during this period consist of 1934 founding a printing house in Mukden to print materials for the Church as it existed under the state of Manchukuo (printers in Hong Kong or China were either unable or unwilling to take on this work). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaspais\n\nGaspais remained in Jilin and Changchun for the remainder of the Japanese occupation and the Civil War that followed. In 1951, he was placed under house arrest and briefly imprisoned before being returned to France. Gaspais died in France in 1952\n\n\nBlois \n\nBlois remained in Mukden until his sudden death due to heart failure in 1946.\n\n\nFather Pierre Duhart, M.E.P.  1901-1963\n\nDuhart was born in France in 1901, ordained in 1925 and sent to China in 1926. After a time as a priest in Xiaobajiazi and Hulan, he taught in the seminary in Jilin. In 1936, he was made the parish priest of the Jilin cathedral and (with a break in 1941 to recover from heart problems) remained in that position until 1946, at which time he was named the superior of the seminary and subsequently Pro-Vicar Apostolic of the mission (I believe that this signifies a secondary or administrative position, as Gaspais himself remained Vicar Apostolic). Later in 1946, he was moved to Changchun and placed under house arrest, but was apparently allowed to work in the seminary garden. He was expelled from China in 1952 and remained a professor in the Petit Séminaire de Mesnil-Flin. He retired from that position in 1962 and died the following year. \n\n\nCharles-Joseph Lemaire, M.E.P.  1900-1995\n\n\nBorn in France in 1900 and ordained in 1929, following study in France and in a doctorate of theology in Rome. Lemaire arrived in Jilin in 1931 and held the position of vicar of the Jilin Cathedral. From 1937-1939, he was in charge of the Jilin Seminary, and from 1939 Cadjutor of the Jilin VA. In this capacity, he often stood in for Gaspais, visiting parishes and conducting confirmation ceremonies. In 1945, he was named Superior General of the MEP, a position that placed him in a position to weather the transformation of Asian missions in the postwar period. He retired from that position in 1975 and at the Retirement Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor until his death in 1995.  \n\n\nIgnatius Pi Shushi 1896-1978\n\nBorn in the Catholic village of Chaling in rural Liaoyang and ordained in 1927, Pi spent his most of his adult life in the Church. In preparation for the transition to Chinese-led dioceses, he was chosen as the inaugural Archbishop of Shenyang and ordained in 1949, just two months before the Communist revolution. \n\n\nAlthough outside the scope of this period, Pi would be imprisoned in 1955 and subsequently serve as the head of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church, which was out of communion with the Vatican. In this capacity, he would subsequently consecrate the dozens of bishops who served the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church well into the 1970s. \n\n\n \n\n### Section: Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\n\nChurch World Service (CWS) 세계기독교봉사회\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the Church World Service (CWS) emerged as one of the most active Christian humanitarian organizations operating in postwar Korea. Originating in 1946 in the aftermath of World War II, CWS was founded by a coalition of American Protestant denominations aiming to provide emergency relief to war-stricken populations in Europe and Asia. By 1951, CWS was formally incorporated as a department of the National Council of Churches (NCC) in the United States, representing over 30 member denominations, and gradually expanded its international operations to include Korea. Following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, CWS moved swiftly to organize its relief efforts. In July 1951, the Korea Church World Service (KCWS) was officially established as the Korean branch, with Edward Adams appointed as chair and Henry D. Appenzeller serving as general secretary. Registered with the United Nations Civil Assistance Command Korea (UNCACK), KCWS was able to legally import and distribute relief goods in cooperation with domestic missionary and social service organizations. Early relief efforts included the distribution of food, medicine, clothing, and essential supplies to war orphans, widows, refugees, and amputees—many of whom were victims of the war's devastation. CWS activities in Korea gradually transitioned from short-term aid to long-term development initiatives. While initially focused on emergency relief, CWS began integrating community development strategies into its programs by the mid-1950s. This shift aligned with broader international trends and U.S. foreign aid policy, particularly the emphasis on \"self-help\" and sustainable reconstruction. CWS supported medical rehabilitation projects, vocational training, orphanages, and technical schools. In addition, it collaborated with Korean Christian organizations such as the Union Christian Service Center (UCSC), YWCA, and YMCA, offering financial and material support while respecting local autonomy and leadership.\n\nOne of the most significant contributions of CWS during this period was its involvement in urban resettlement projects. In particular, the Eungam-dong Resettlement Project in 1958 exemplified how CWS expanded its activities to address the challenges of urban poverty and natural disaster relief. Following a devastating flood that displaced over 9,000 residents from the makeshift shantytown in Ichon-dong along the Han River, CWS collaborated with the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other international agencies such as the Catholic Relief Service (CRS) to relocate and rehouse flood victims. CWS played a central role in constructing temporary shelters, operating food kitchens, and providing building materials for permanent housing. Importantly, the project applied a self-help model, wherein residents were expected to participate in interior construction while the government and aid organizations handled infrastructure and structural work. Despite logistical delays and limitations in resources, this project was a milestone in Korea’s postwar urban welfare history, representing an early attempt to establish Christian community-based social development within a rapidly urbanizing context.\n\nThis endeavor also marked a significant expansion of CWS’s mission—from rural development to urban humanitarian intervention. It demonstrated a clear response to the growing needs of postwar Korean society, particularly as the population of Seoul surged and informal settlements proliferated. In this respect, CWS’s engagement in urban resettlement was not only practical but symbolically powerful, embodying the ecumenical spirit in action and pioneering a model of Christian social welfare that combined relief with reconstruction and advocacy. The philosophical underpinning of CWS’s work was deeply rooted in the Social Gospel tradition. While its activities aligned in part with the anti-communist orientation of U.S. Cold War policy, the mission of CWS went beyond geopolitical motives. It was driven by a theological commitment to social justice and compassion—viewing the alleviation of poverty, disease, and displacement as moral imperatives of the Christian faith. Through its partnership with Korean churches and communities, CWS fostered a sustainable framework that would later influence the rise of Korean Christian NGOs and faith-based development work in the decades to come. By the late 1960s, many of the programs initiated by CWS were gradually handed over to Korean organizations, such as the Korea Christian Service (KCS), reflecting a transition toward local ownership and self-sufficiency. This trajectory affirms the dual legacy of CWS in Korea: as both a provider of urgent humanitarian aid during a time of national crisis and as a catalyst for the indigenization of Christian social action and development.\n\n\nUnion Christian Service Center (UCSC) 기독교연합봉사회\n\n\nThe Union Christian Service Center (UCSC), established in Daejeon in 1949, was Korea’s first missionary-led ecumenical service organization founded in response to the postwar crisis and the devastation of the Korean War. Unlike other foreign aid agencies of the time, UCSC was not directed by a headquarters overseas; it was an autonomous initiative launched by missionaries from various denominations—including the Northern Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Salvation Army, and the United Church of Canada—who sought to embody Christian values through practical social engagement and reconstruction in Korea.\n\nFrom the beginning, UCSC went beyond mere relief work. Its mission was rooted in Christian ideals of justice, compassion, and empowerment. Central to its activities was the establishment of Christian rural leadership training schools—commonly known as Gospel Farmers' Schools —throughout the country. Starting in 1953 in Daejeon, the schools expanded to Hae-nam, Gwangju, Chuncheon, and Cheongju, providing six-month to year-long courses in modern agricultural techniques, cooperative management, leadership skills, and Christian ethics. Graduates of these programs returned to their villages as leaders capable of organizing and revitalizing their local communities. UCSC also operated model farms where modern agricultural methods—such as mechanized farming, improved fertilizers, and crop hybridization—were tested and taught. These farms served as living laboratories and community centers, enabling farmers to learn by doing. In addition, UCSC established clinics, rehabilitation centers, and vocational training workshops for war orphans, widows, amputees, and other marginalized groups. The prosthetics workshops and physical therapy programs pioneered by UCSC were especially innovative and largely unavailable elsewhere in Korea at the time. The organization placed special emphasis on empowering women and youth. Sewing classes, vocational programs, and literacy education for women were introduced in various regions. These efforts enabled women to gain financial independence and return to their communities as educators or volunteer leaders. While most foreign aid organizations of the time focused on children and male breadwinners, UCSC recognized women and youth as critical actors in rebuilding postwar society.\n\nUCSC’s success was also due to its strong collaborative networks. It maintained partnerships with the Korea Church World Service (KCWS), Christian Children’s Fund (CCF), YWCA, YMCA, and the Korea National Christian Council (KNCC), among others. These partnerships allowed for efficient distribution of resources and shared responsibility in community-based programs. For example, the Gospel Farmers' Schools were funded by KCWS, while women's education programs were co-managed with YWCA. Crucially, UCSC’s philosophy was not one of charity but of participation, education, and self-help. Rather than simply providing aid, UCSC empowered individuals and communities to identify their needs, build capacities, and take ownership of their recovery. This approach anticipated many of the participatory development and community organizing principles that would later define Korean NGOs and Christian civic movements. By the late 1950s, UCSC had established dozens of local centers across the country, each serving not only as a service facility but also as a hub for Christian community-building and grassroots empowerment. Its three-pronged strategy—leadership training, material support, and community organization—became a model for future Christian development work in Korea.\n\nIn sum, UCSC was one of the most innovative and holistic Christian mission-based social movements in postwar Korea. By integrating war relief, rural development, vocational training, rehabilitation services, and community organizing into a coherent ministry, UCSC not only addressed urgent needs but also laid the foundations for a long-term vision of Christian engagement with Korean society. Its legacy continues today as a foundational model for Christian social welfare and civic action.\n\n\nChristian Children’s Fund (CCF) 기독교아동복리회\n\n\nThe Christian Children’s Fund (CCF), originally founded in 1938 by American Presbyterian minister J. Calvitt Clarke, was one of the most active and influential foreign non-governmental organizations in Korea during and after the Korean War. Established with a vision to support children suffering from war and poverty across the globe, CCF began informal activities in Korea around 1948. Its efforts intensified dramatically after the outbreak of the Korean War, leading to its official registration as a foundation in 1955 under the name \"Christian Children’s Fund of Korea.\"\n\nDuring the 1950s, CCF focused primarily on direct aid to children and collaboration with local welfare institutions. Its signature initiative was a one-to-one sponsorship program that connected American sponsors with individual Korean children. This system, novel at the time in Korea, enabled consistent and personalized support in the form of food, clothing, medicine, educational materials, and emotional care. Letters, photographs, and gifts exchanged between sponsors and children fostered not only material assistance but also emotional bonds and a sense of connection to the outside world—a crucial factor in healing the psychological wounds left by war.\n\nCCF’s support extended far beyond orphanages. By partnering with over 250 childcare institutions nationwide, the organization offered comprehensive assistance including tuition, medical support, vocational training, hygiene education, and psychosocial counseling. It also established the CCF Korea Federation in 1953, a network that brought together directors of child welfare institutions across the country. This federation played a pivotal role in shaping Korea’s early social welfare infrastructure and helped to professionalize child welfare practices. CCF also published Donggwang, a professional journal for social workers, fostering the development of indigenous welfare theories and practices. In particular, CCF was deeply involved in the Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, where the devastation of war had left a significant number of orphans and impoverished children. Institutions such as the Gwangju Christian Nursery, Suncheon Gospel Nursery, and Yeosu Christian Nursery became key sites of CCF's involvement. These facilities, often established or run by local churches and missionaries, received financial and material support through CCF’s sponsorship model. The Gwangju Christian Nursery, for example, developed a long-term partnership with a church community in Louisiana, USA. Through this relationship, children not only received regular aid but also engaged in personal exchanges with their sponsors, forming enduring transnational relationships that strengthened their sense of identity and hope. CCF’s commitment to partnership with local institutions was evident in its efforts to strengthen the capabilities of childcare workers. It regularly held training seminars and leadership workshops for local welfare administrators in the Honam region, which helped fill the vacuum in formal social work education at the time. CCF also developed mobile distribution systems to deliver food, clothing, and educational supplies to children living outside of institutions, particularly in isolated rural areas. This flexible and inclusive approach extended the reach of child welfare services to those who were often excluded from traditional welfare systems.\n\nBy the late 1950s, CCF had become a de facto pillar of Korea’s child welfare system. At a time when government funding for child welfare was minimal—accounting for only 26.8% of facility budgets in 1957—foreign aid made up 32.8%, with CCF as one of the largest contributors. As the 1960s progressed, foreign aid surpassed 50% of funding in the sector. In this context, CCF functioned not merely as a relief organization but as a substitute welfare provider in the absence of state capacity. Its efforts laid the groundwork for Korea’s eventual transition toward a more institutionalized and professionalized welfare system. The legacy of CCF in 1950s Korea is threefold. First, it established a systematic, sustainable approach to child welfare through its sponsorship and institutional support model. Second, it contributed to the formation and professionalization of Korea’s social welfare workforce through education, networking, and publication. Third, it provided a transitional framework for Korea’s welfare system at a time when the state was unable to fulfill this role. CCF’s welfare philosophy emphasized holistic care and dignity, not charity. Through personalized support, institutional partnerships, and grassroots empowerment, it shaped a new paradigm of child welfare in Korea. The Gwangju and Jeolla region examples are representative of how CCF’s impact extended beyond urban centers and into rural communities across the nation. These regional efforts underscore the organization’s commitment to building localized, sustainable models of care that reflected the complex needs of postwar Korean society. Ultimately, the Christian Children’s Fund played a leading role in developing Korea’s child welfare system during one of the most vulnerable periods in its modern history. Its work went beyond relief—it built structures, nurtured communities, and empowered children and caregivers alike. Its legacy lives on today through its successor organization, ChildFund Korea (formerly Korea Christian Children's Fund), one of the largest child welfare NGOs in the country.\n\n\nYWCA\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the YWCA of Korea played a pivotal role in Christian women's activism through a range of practical efforts aimed at supporting women, children, and local communities during the national crises of liberation and the Korean War. Organizationally, it resumed activities that had been halted under Japanese colonial rule, and in 1947 sent a delegation of ten women to the World YWCA Council in Hangzhou, China. This marked a major step in re-establishing Korea YWCA as an independent actor within the international women’s movement. When the Korean War broke out, the YWCA immediately mobilized to provide relief for refugees, war orphans, and widows. Branches in Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, and other cities opened their centers as shelters, hosting hundreds of refugees daily and distributing food and clothing. They also founded orphanages, offered child care, and supported the livelihoods of single mothers and war widows. For example, Daejeon YWCA provided shelter to more than 150 people per day, while Gwangju YWCA, led by General Secretary Jo Ah-ra, established a nursery to offer practical support to women and children in the region.\n\nSimultaneously, the YWCA provided vocational training and education to support women's self-reliance. Women were taught practical skills such as sewing, cooking, and household management to help them achieve economic independence. Leadership training for women was also emphasized, enabling them to become active participants in social life. Youth and student programs continued through Bible study and cultural activities, and student groups were organized to train young leaders. Even amidst war, these initiatives helped foster a sense of community and moral values among the next generation.\n\nEsther Park, who served as a senior advisor, acted as a civilian diplomat while staying in the United States during the war. She reached out to the World YWCA and the United Nations to inform them about Korea’s desperate situation and request assistance. In an article for the World YWCA bulletin, she wrote that \"we cannot just sit and cry,\" emphasizing hope and a sense of responsibility despite the devastation. Her international outreach contributed greatly to securing humanitarian support from abroad. In addition to relief work, the YWCA also conducted educational programs for women in rural areas, promoted local welfare initiatives, and operated programs to instill democratic civic values. Through all of these activities, the YWCA established itself not merely as a Christian women's organization but as a community committed to social responsibility. Rooted in Christian faith, its efforts helped restore families, support women, and rebuild communities in a war-torn society, laying the foundation for the broader social movements of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n\nYWCA\n\nThe 1960s was a period in South Korea shaped by authoritarian nationalism and rapid industrialization, following the military coup led by Park Chung-hee in 1961. During this time, women were primarily regarded as tools of “national reconstruction” and “modernization,” seen less as political or economic agents and more as guardians of domestic order and state-directed consumption. Within this context, the Korean YWCA did not passively follow government initiatives but actively engaged in a Christian-based civic movement. It emphasized women’s self-awareness, education, vocational development, and civic participation, distinguishing itself as an independent actor in civil society. The YWCA’s concrete efforts in women’s social education, consumer rights activism, job training, and international networking made it one of the most dynamic women’s organizations in the country.\n\nOne of its most prominent initiatives was the establishment of a Women's Center in Namsan, Seoul, in 1963, which served as a base for various social education programs. These included vocational training in sewing, cooking, and cosmetology, as well as civic education on budgeting, legal literacy (especially family law), and consumer responsibility. A particularly notable project was the campaign to encourage marriage registration among women. This was a pioneering legal rights education initiative designed to protect wives’ legal status, especially in cases of abandonment or informal divorce. The campaign framed women not just as passive dependents but as legal subjects capable of asserting their rights in a modern legal system.\n\nIn 1965, the YWCA hosted a national conference under the theme “The Housewife’s Thrift as the Foundation of National Resources,” promoting food conservation, support for domestic products, and the fight against price collusion and unsafe consumer goods. The organization’s reporting of unfair pricing practices in beauty salons and its campaigns for food safety marked an early consumer rights movement led by women. Significantly, the YWCA did not merely promote state policies on thrift but advanced a critical vision of women as “consumer citizens,” capable of ethical and collective decision-making. Such initiatives were not merely economic but ideological interventions that reframed women as agents of citizenship. While the state attempted to mobilize women’s organizations into politically neutral and state-compliant roles, the YWCA maintained a delicate balance between cooperation and independence. For instance, in 1966, Mokpo YWCA’s founder Choi Chan-yeol was awarded the Yongsin Prize for her exemplary social service, illustrating the moral legitimacy of voluntary, community-based Christian service that transcended state co-optation.³\n\nThe YWCA also strengthened its international presence during the 1960s. While the Park regime utilized women’s groups to improve its international image, the YWCA leveraged this opportunity to deepen ties with global movements such as the World YWCA and the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF). Notable figures like Kim Hwal-lan and Lee Sook-jung, key actors in both national and international Christian women’s networks, represented Korean women at global conferences. These engagements became platforms for introducing the Korean women’s movement to the world and situating it within a broader Christian human rights framework. Nevertheless, the YWCA also encountered tension with the government. In 1965, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs attempted to reclaim the Namsan Women’s Center building, arguing it would be repurposed for broader access. The YWCA protested, revealing that the space was in fact reassigned for male officials’ meetings and government events, criticizing the decision as undermining women’s organizing. This conflict reflects the ongoing negotiation between state control and civil society autonomy, in which the YWCA often operated on contested terrain.\n\nThe Korean YWCA’s work in the 1960s was not merely a reaction to state-led modernization, but a faith-based civic engagement grounded in a holistic vision of women’s spiritual and societal growth. Its emphasis on self-education, community service, legal rights, and democratic homemaking fostered a new model of Christian womanhood that was active, ethical, and publicly engaged. Far from being a passive partner in national development, the YWCA cultivated the foundation for later feminist activism in the 1970s by modeling alternative paths to female empowerment under an authoritarian regime.\n\nKorean Student Christian Council\n\n\nThe Korean Student Christian Council (KSCC), active from 1959 to 1969, played a pivotal role in systematically unifying the fragmented post-liberation Christian student movements in South Korea and connecting them with the global ecumenical movement. Far beyond functioning as a cooperative council among various Christian student organizations, KSCC served as the institutional and ideological incubator for democratization efforts and socially engaged Christian activism in the 1970s.\n\nKSCC was established following a proposal in October 1955 by U Kyaw Than, then Asian Secretary of the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF), during his visit to Korea. He recommended the unification of the three existing Christian student groups—the college YMCA, college YWCA, and the Korea Student Christian Movement (KSCM). In July 1959, the three organizations formally launched KSCC as a collaborative body to facilitate this integration process. In a 1959 roundtable discussion in Christian Thought, theologian Kang Won-yong described the earlier Korean Christian student movement as “unmatched in its vitality globally,” but also noted its recent stagnation. “In the past, the movement did not flourish because it was well-led from above, but because students in each campus actively organized and took initiative themselves... Now, those students have entered a period of dormancy,” he observed. To overcome this stagnation, KSCC initiated the Leadership Motivation for Change (LMC) program in major cities like Seoul, Daegu, and Gwangju beginning in 1960. This program included both Bible study and critical engagement with contemporary issues—such as nationalism, democracy, communism, and secularism—via weekly three-hour sessions held at the Jensen Memorial Hall. Professors and pastors such as Han Bae-ho (Korea University), Kim Dong-soo (Sungkwang Church), and Hyun Young-hak (Ewha Womans University) served as lecturers.\n\nAt the 1961 KSCC Executive Committee meeting, 103 students participated, including 26 from KSCM, 40 from the YMCA, and 37 from the YWCA. James T. Laney, an American Methodist missionary and theologian teaching at Yonsei University, delivered a keynote titled \"New Issues in Community Development,\" while notable scholars such as Kim Hyung-seok, Ryu Tong-shik, Chang Chun-ha, and Kang Won-yong also contributed. Laney also introduced an innovative Bible study curriculum titled The Calling of the Christian Student, combining scripture with discussion on issues such as Korea-Japan normalization, the widening gap between rich and poor, and industrialization. According to records, “This meeting included discussions on Korea-Japan relations, the inequalities brought about by industrialization, and a variety of political and social issues.” KSCC also organized nationwide training programs that emphasized social responsibility as intrinsic to the Christian faith. Their understanding of the gospel moved beyond private salvation to include a call for humanization and social justice. Students were sent into urban slums, rural communities, and industrial sites for field surveys, relief activities, and service projects. These efforts laid the foundation for what would later be known as the Student Social Development Corps (Haksa-dan). Although officially launched in the 1970s, the origins of this movement trace directly back to KSCC activities in 1968–1969. In 1968, KSCC co-hosted an ecumenical policy consultation with the National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC), resulting in a resolution affirming the “support and strengthening of a unified student movement.” During the summer of 1968, approximately 500 students from eight cities participated in pilot Haksa-dan activities, forming small teams of five to eight members who lived and worked among the poor. Their slogan, “Renew Korea,” became symbolic of both their mission and the theological vision that shaped their activism.\n\nIn sum, KSCC should not be seen as a mere collaborative council but as a transformative platform that reshaped the identity and direction of the Korean Christian student movement. It established a practice of integrating faith with public life, grounded the Christian message in democratic and human rights discourse, and bridged the local realities of Korea with global ecumenical thought. Though KSCC formally dissolved in 1970 with the formation of the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), its vision and legacy continued in subsequent rural mission work, urban poor advocacy, and democratization struggles throughout the 1970s and beyond.\n\n\nKorean Association of Christian Professors (KACP) 기독교교수자협회\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Korean Association of Christian Professors (KACP) emerged as a representative body of Protestant intellectuals in post-revolution South Korea. More than a scholarly society, this group sought to integrate Christian faith with academic inquiry and actively explored sociopolitical engagement. Its efforts laid the groundwork for subsequent movements for democracy and social justice. The KACP developed amid theological and political debates within the Korean Protestant community, including the ecumenical movement, the question of church-state separation, and the theological legitimacy of social engagement. The association was informally organized in 1957 by professors involved in Christian student movements and was formally established in 1966.\n\nA major area of activity for the KACP was its organizational guidance of Christian student movements. Through its collaboration with the Korean Student Christian Council (KSCC, 1959) and the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF, from 1968), KACP members provided ideological direction and facilitated leadership development through seminars and academic conferences. Leading figures such as Kim Chun-bae, Kim Sung-sik, and Hyun Young-hak delivered lectures on topics like “Christian Faith and Scholarship” and “Christian Witness in the University,” addressing the role of faith in academic life and society. These professors saw the university not merely as a mission field, but as a space for the authentic embodiment of faith. Kim Sung-sik asserted in an article for Kidokgyo Sasang (Christian Thought) that “a Christian is a social being, with a responsibility to testify to truth in the realms of politics and history,” emphasizing that Christian intellectuals must not separate faith from public life. \n\nBehind this activity was the theological vision of Kim Jae-jun, who provided the foundational thinking for the association’s engagement with society. He argued that the gospel does not permit silence in the face of injustice but demands action on behalf of righteousness. While not directly organizing KACP events, Kim deeply influenced both students and professors. He challenged the notion of political neutrality, asking pointedly, “Can one live even a single day without being involved in politics?” For Kim, to avoid public responsibility was a form of hypocrisy incompatible with authentic faith. Another central figure, Pastor Park Hyung-kyu, was active both in the KACP and as a student movement leader within the YMCA. He declared that “the sons of light must put on the full armor of God and confront the powers of darkness,” invoking Korea’s legacy of Christian resistance against imperialism and war as a mandate to resist authoritarianism once more. He later founded Galilee Church and expanded his ministry into urban missions and poverty advocacy, becoming a key link between student activism and labor movements during the Yushin regime. KACP’s activities in the 1960s thus extended far beyond theological seminars or campus religious life. The association sought to develop a Christian intellectual response to South Korea’s modernization, industrialization, and division. Influenced by the global ecumenical movement, KACP members considered what it meant to be “the church in the world,” forming a foundation for more radical Christian movements of the 1970s such as the Urban Industrial Mission and the 1973 Declaration for National Salvation.\n\nUltimately, the KACP of the 1960s serves as a significant example of how Christian conscience and public action intersected during a critical period in Korean modern history. Through its intellectual, theological, and activist legacy, the association played a crucial role in shaping the Christian contributions to South Korea’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nFigure 1.

The Park Chung Hee regime's Five-Year Economic Development Plans aimed to modernize the nation but simultaneously entrenched a system where urban workers, often recent migrants from rural areas, had little to no rights or protections. In this historical context, the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) arose as a Protestant movement that sought to respond to structural injustices and to practice the gospel in the midst of industrial society.\n\nThe Youngdeungpo Urban Industrial Mission, established in 1958 under the Evangelism Department of the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap), began operating in Seoul's Youngdeungpo area, which had become the country’s largest industrial zone. This region had transformed into a major industrial site since the 1930s due to Japan’s colonial industrialization policies and had further developed after the Korean War, as many factories were rebuilt and refugees settled there. A leading figure in the 1960s was Rev. George Song (Jo Ji-Song), who joined the Youngdeungpo Mission in 1964. He sought to live among workers, emphasizing that “the gospel must be spoken in the language of the workers and carried in the suffering of their lives.” He firmly believed that “evangelizing workers is not merely about making them believe in Jesus, but about helping them live as human beings.” George Song formed a women workers’ fellowship called Shinbonghoe, which focused on fellowship, evangelism, and service, aiming to build a faith-based community from within the workers themselves. He described this approach as “preaching by living in the mines,” referring to the practice of student ministers living and working in labor environments to model incarnational ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission, led by American Methodist missionary Rev. George Ogle, began in 1961 and pioneered a different model of pastoral work. Ogle insisted that “ministers must work alongside laborers and embody the gospel through shared labor.” He launched the “working pastors program,” in which clergy were sent into factories to experience the workers’ lives firsthand. He believed this was the only way the church could show that it truly stood with the poor and oppressed. Ogle asserted that the church should be socially responsible and democratic, stating, “Workers must have a voice in the factories. Democratization must begin in the workplace.” His prophetic ministry drew the ire of the government, and in 1974 he was expelled under charges of violating “national policy.” One of the triggering events was his statement: “We must try to save the people of the People’s Revolutionary Party (Inhyeokdang), who have been sentenced without evidence.”\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission was not simply about preaching in factories—it was a bold theological response to industrial society’s contradictions. Both Song and Ogle challenged the traditional church’s detachment from social realities, arguing that the church must weep with the suffering and act for justice. Their efforts laid the foundation for the labor democratization movements that would rise in the following decades.\n\n\nBlue Cross Medical Cooperative 청십자의료조합\n\n\nAmid the postwar poverty and social disintegration of 1960s Korea, the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative (Cheongsipja) emerged as a pioneering non-profit health insurance initiative. Organized and led by Christians, particularly Dr. Jang Gi-ryeo—a devout Presbyterian and compassionate surgeon—this initiative played a crucial role in bridging the healthcare gap for low-income citizens at a time when the state lacked comprehensive public health insurance systems.\n\nThe cooperative was founded on May 13, 1968, in Busan, beginning with the participation of 23 local churches and 723 initial members. Within a month, membership rose to 1,129 across 35 churches and grew to 1,662 by the end of the year. Churches such as Bum-in Church (120 members) and Busan First Church (112 members) were key participants. By 1988, the cooperative had approximately 230,000 members, and over its two-decade operation, around 530,000 individuals had joined. The cooperative was deeply rooted in Christian ethics of love, sacrifice, and justice. Dr. Jang explicitly stated during the inaugural meeting, “In the early Church, we saw the sharing of resources among believers. Yet this was not an imposed system like that of socialism or communism—it was voluntary.” This reflected a theology of voluntary solidarity, rather than forced redistribution. The insurance system was shaped by principles of fairness and grace: all members paid a flat premium regardless of age, gender, or health risks (60 KRW/month), and anyone could join or withdraw freely. The organization was operated democratically, with decisions made by boards and member-elected representatives through consensus.\n\nThe idea for the Blue Cross emerged from the “Busan Meeting,” a Bible study and discussion group organized by Dr. Jang, where Christian students and intellectuals gathered. The arrival of Chae Gyu-cheol—who had studied cooperative insurance in Denmark—led to a turning point. After he introduced the Danish model, the group decided to implement a similar system in Busan. The name Blue Cross was inspired by the American Blue Cross, but with no formal connection. The name was chosen over “Christian” to allow for broader participation while still maintaining a Christian ethos. Despite early skepticism from the public, local churches provided critical support by promoting the insurance program among their congregations. The system's democratic governance, egalitarian premiums, and transparent structure gained trust across communities. Dr. Jang, who had experienced North Korea’s public health model, sought a Christian and democratic alternative. His hospital—the Gospel Hospital in Busan—served as the center of medical services for Blue Cross members.\n\nThe Blue Cross Medical Cooperative holds enduring significance not only as a historical experiment in health care delivery but also as a model with relevant policy implications for contemporary systems. First, it offered a compelling alternative to commercial health insurance. Unlike profit-driven private insurers, which often prioritize financial returns over public welfare, the Blue Cross model was firmly rooted in non-profit, ethical principles. It demonstrated that affordable, equitable health coverage could be sustained without resorting to market mechanisms that often exclude the vulnerable. Second, the cooperative’s democratic governance structure served as a practical example of participatory decision-making in public health. Key decisions were made through elected representatives and community boards, fostering a sense of accountability and transparency that is frequently lacking in both state and commercial systems. This model suggests that involving beneficiaries in the decision-making process can enhance trust and responsiveness in health administration. Third, the initiative highlighted how Christian values and institutions could serve broader public purposes in pluralistic societies. While grounded in Christian ethics, the cooperative did not discriminate based on religion, allowing people of all backgrounds to participate. This inclusivity underscores the potential of faith-based organizations to contribute meaningfully to public service and social innovation. Finally, the historical legacy of the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative lies in its influence on South Korea’s national policy. As a precursor to the National Health Insurance (NHI) system, which was officially launched in 1989, it served as both a conceptual and practical reference point. The cooperative’s archives, operational principles, and community-centered approach provided valuable lessons for the design of Korea’s universal healthcare infrastructure. In this way, Blue Cross affirmed the vital role that civil society—and especially faith-inspired actors—can play in shaping public policy and expanding social welfare.\n\n\nTable 6.

Led by Rev. Joon Gon Kim, CCC went beyond being a mere campus ministry to become the strategic command center of the national evangelization movement, implementing a theology and practice that fused evangelical faith with nationalistic aspirations. Amid political polarization and denominational divisions, CCC promoted unity through evangelism and simultaneously engaged with social and public concerns, leaving a deep impact both within the church and in broader society.\n\nThe emergence of CCC occurred against the backdrop of late-1960s turmoil in Korea—political instability, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the Yushin Constitution, and church division over WCC membership. In this climate, Rev. Joon Gon Kim proclaimed, “Only the gospel can save the nation,” and envisioned evangelization as the pathway to national renewal.\n\nIn 1965, the National Evangelization Movement was launched by prominent Christian leaders such as Kim Hwal-lan, Han Kyung-chik, and Kim Joon Gon, under the slogan “Thirty Million to Christ.” This campaign became the first nationwide strategy for organized, cross-sectoral evangelism targeting urban centers, villages, students, the military, children, and overseas Koreans. CCC played a key role by managing leadership training, developing evangelistic materials, and coordinating local rallies. It was “an ecumenical evangelistic movement that transcended theological divisions,” forging rare unity among conservative and progressive Protestants.\n\nIn 1972, CCC launched the Holy City Movement to evangelize Korea’s cities, which culminated in EXPLO ’74, the largest evangelistic rally in Korean history, held at Yeouido Plaza with over 1.5 million attendees. This event showcased CCC Korea’s unparalleled organizational capacity and passion for national evangelization to the global church. It was not merely a revival meeting, but the culmination of CCC’s discipleship training systems, local church partnerships, and mass-media-based evangelism strategies.\n\nCCC’s efforts within the church professionalized evangelism and discipleship. Many local churches adopted CCC’s training models or participated in joint events that helped them grow. After the Holy City Movement, CCC envisioned a church presence in every gospel-saturated city and developed “strategic partnerships” with churches to that end. Many churches even appointed CCC-trained student leaders to leadership roles. However, CCC’s use of anti-communist language and association with national development ideologies also created friction with progressive Protestant sectors.\n\nIn the 1970s, CCC was not merely a gospel-proclaiming body but functioned as a “national evangelical movement” that articulated theological critiques of society through a mission-centered lens. Rev. Joon Gon Kim proclaimed, “Democratization without evangelization is a mere façade, and nationalism without God is a hollow illusion,” firmly rejecting political reform without spiritual transformation. CCC laid the groundwork for Korean evangelical nationalism that would shape the theology and praxis of churches in the 1980s, linking gospel, nation, and youth into a single narrative of Christian identity.\n\n\nTable 1.

Under the authoritarian rule of President Park Chung Hee, South Korea experienced rapid state-led economic growth, but beneath the surface lay widespread labor exploitation, growing socioeconomic inequality, and political repression. In response, KSCF rejected a narrow, evangelistic focus and took the lead in embodying the social responsibility of faith, driven by young people’s yearning to “establish God’s justice on earth.”\n\nFormed in 1969 through the unification of the university division of the Korea Student Christian Council (KSCC) and the university YMCA, KSCF was rooted in ecumenical theology and the global Christian youth movement. Influenced by the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Student Christian Movement (SCM), KSCF embraced the idea of a “responsible society” and sought to respond faithfully to the injustices embedded in the social structure. A pivotal turning point came on November 13, 1970, when a young garment worker, Jeon Tae-il, self-immolated in protest against harsh labor conditions in the Peace Market. His death shocked Korean society and compelled Christian students to re-examine how the gospel could be lived out in the real world.\n\nKSCF immediately responded theologically and communally to Jeon’s death. During a public theology lecture series organized by the Yonsei University Divinity School, KSCF Secretary General Oh Jae-sik discarded his prepared remarks to share news of Jeon’s death and interpreted it as a sacrifice akin to Christ’s crucifixion. In the December 1970 issue of Christian Thought, he published an essay titled “A Certain Jesus’ Death,” asserting that “Jeon’s death was the crucifixion of Jesus in our time”. His statement provoked intense backlash from conservative Protestant circles, and Oh reportedly faced physical threats as a result. KSCF’s response did not stop at theological interpretation but extended to tangible actions. Shortly after Jeon’s death, KSCF co-organized an interdenominational memorial service at Yeondong Church with Pax Romana (the Catholic university student association), the Urban Industrial Mission Practitioners’ Council, and the Catholic Workers’ Youth Movement (JOC). At the service, a “Confession of Commitment” was read, repenting for societal sins that led to Jeon’s death and calling Christians to solidarity with workers. At Saemunan Church, university students held a fasting prayer vigil, and students from the Methodist and Presbyterian seminaries issued public statements, affirming that true Christian faith must stand with the suffering.\n\nIn tandem with these actions, KSCF intensified its Student Community Development Corps (Haksa-dan), a program launched in 1969. Based on the community organizing theories of Saul Alinsky in the United States, this program mobilized small groups of Christian students to live and work alongside marginalized communities—including factory workers, slum residents, and rural laborers—embodying a form of social discipleship rooted in practical faith. Jeon Tae-il’s death further galvanized the program, as students increasingly viewed solidarity with the oppressed as an essential expression of their faith. These efforts positioned KSCF as a key actor in laying the theological and social foundations for South Korea’s democratization movement in the 1970s. Rather than merely advocating progressive theology, KSCF implemented a praxis of prayer, solidarity, and structural transformation. Theologian Kim Myung-bae noted that “KSCF was the community that most radically socialized faith, serving as a bridge between the democratization movement and the church”. These efforts contributed to later movements such as the Urban Industrial Mission and Minjung theology, as well as to the broader pro-democracy movement of the 1980s.\n\nMore importantly, KSCF demonstrated that faith and democracy, gospel and justice, were not mutually exclusive. Its members pursued a life of witness rooted in the conviction that “the justice of God’s Kingdom is found among the poor and the suffering.” This path often led to hardship and rejection, but it also revealed a prophetic possibility for church reform and hope for Christian engagement in society. KSCF’s religious praxis thus forged a vital bridge between the democratization movement and the Korean church. In the face of state violence and church silence under the Yushin regime, Christian students reinterpreted faith as a public vocation and embraced justice for the marginalized as a core gospel imperative. They argued that the church must go beyond worship halls to walk alongside the suffering in workplaces, back alleys, and rural villages. KSCF did not engage in abstract ideology but lived out its theology in acts of solidarity, showing that the church could stand on the side of justice rather than complacency. In doing so, KSCF helped shape the moral language of Korean democracy and embodied the possibility that the church could become an agent of social transformation.\n\n\nTable 2.

While KSCC represents the earlier ecumenical and social engagement-oriented student movement, KSCF emerged as a renewal and expansion of this tradition with a stronger emphasis on field-based social practice and democratization. In contrast, Korea CCC followed a distinctly evangelical path with an emphasis on personal salvation and cooperation with state-led modernization.\n\n\nNational Council of Churches in Korea\n\n\nIn the politically repressive atmosphere of 1970s South Korea, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) emerged as the primary ecumenical voice resisting the Park Chung Hee regime. Theologically rooted in the Missio Dei framework, the NCCK emphasized that God's mission included not only spiritual salvation but also justice, peace, and liberation from structural sin. This theological commitment led to a series of public declarations which had both theological depth and political urgency.\n\nThe 1973 \"Declaration of Korean Christians\" was a pivotal moment in Korean Protestant resistance. While anonymous due to the threat of government retaliation, the declaration prophetically denounced the Yushin regime, declaring, \"What moves us today is not the expectation of victory, but a confession of guilt before God.\" This statement framed resistance as a spiritual imperative and denounced the October Yushin (1972) as a betrayal of both the nation and Christian conscience.\n\nFollowing this, the 1974 \"Theological Declaration of Korean Christians\" articulated a more developed theological rationale for church participation in social liberation. It emphasized that salvation must be understood holistically, addressing not only individual sin but also systemic injustice. This declaration explicitly challenged the church to stand with the marginalized and to reject complicity with oppressive structures.\n\nThe NCCK's actions were situated within a broader context of Christian nationalism and revivalist fervor. Movements such as the Minjok Bogeumhwa (National Evangelization Movement), spearheaded by figures like Kim Joon Gon, aimed to use Christian revivalism as a means of national renewal. Mass rallies like Billy Graham's 1973 crusade and Explo '74 were held in state-managed spaces like Yeouido Plaza with government approval, revealing a strategic alliance between revivalist Protestantism and the anti-communist state apparatus.\n\nWhile the NCCK maintained a prophetic critique of state power, other segments of the Protestant church engaged in the national evangelization project as a means to bolster a sense of Christian nationalism. The theological framing of Minjok (ethnic nation) as an object of salvation and the strategic deployment of mass revival events functioned to blur the line between nationalism and evangelism. Kim Joon Gon famously declared on January 1, 1971: \"There is no faster and better way to the reunification of the two Koreas and the well-being of the nation than the mobilization of two million Christians to achieve a national revolution through evangelism.\"\n\nIn contrast, the NCCK’s 1973 and 1974 declarations emphasized solidarity with the oppressed and theological critique of militarized power. These statements laid the groundwork for Minjung Theology, which interpreted the gospel through the suffering and agency of the oppressed Korean masses. The emphasis on God's preferential option for the poor represented a significant departure from the state-aligned nationalism of revivalist evangelicals.\n\nThus, the 1970s witnessed a theological divergence within Korean Protestantism. On one side stood the NCCK, articulating a liberationist vision rooted in justice and solidarity; on the other, a state-aligned revivalist movement that sacralized nation-building and anti-communism as spiritual mandates.\n\n\nSummary of the Declaration of Korean Christians (1973)\n\nWe, as Korean Christians, issue this declaration in response to the oppressive political climate following the Yushin Constitution of October 17, 1972. Recognizing the risks involved, we choose to remain anonymous.\n\nConfession of Faith: We believe that Christians are called by God to stand with the oppressed, proclaim the truth, and participate in social and political reform.\n\nCritique of the Regime: We denounce the authoritarian rule, suppression of conscience and religious freedom, media manipulation, political persecution, and economic injustice perpetrated by the current government.\n\nCall to Action: We urge the rejection of laws and policies that disregard the sovereignty of the people and call for national solidarity to restore democracy.\n\nAppeal for Global Solidarity: We request prayers and support from the global Christian community, emphasizing our shared commitment to justice and peace.\n\n\nSummary of the Theological Declaration of Korean Christians (1974)\n\nOn November 18, 1974, sixty-six theologians and pastors issued this declaration, articulating the church's theological stance and social responsibility:\n\nHolistic Understanding of Salvation: Salvation encompasses not only the forgiveness of individual sins but also liberation from oppressive social structures.\n\nRole of the Church: The church must stand in solidarity with the oppressed and lead efforts to realize justice and peace.\n\nCritique of Government: We denounce the unjust intervention of state power and the human rights violations resulting from flawed economic structures.\n\nTheological Foundation: We affirm that through the work of the Holy Spirit, we are called to participate in creating a new society and history.\n\n\nKorean Christian Professors Association (KCPA)\n\n\nIn the turbulent political landscape of 1970s South Korea, the Korean Christian Professors Association (KCPA) emerged not merely as a gathering of Protestant intellectuals but as a theological vanguard actively responding to authoritarianism and social injustice. The KCPA, founded in 1966 in the spirit of the ecumenical movement, quickly became a crucible for theological engagement with Korea’s socio-political realities. Its members, many of whom were influenced by global ecumenical trends and theologies of liberation, particularly WCC’s theology of humanization, laid the groundwork for what would later become Minjung theology. This intellectual and theological ferment gave rise to a faith practice that was not only doctrinal but also deeply political.\n\nThe theological commitment of the KCPA centered on a vision of human liberation grounded in the Gospel. As Koh Ji Soo notes, the movement’s core was an “attempt to theologically reconstitute the people alienated in the process of industrialization as subjects of labor and production” through the concept of Minjung theology, which he categorizes as a “discourse of theological humanization.” This humanization was not abstract but deeply embodied in Korea’s historical context, where the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee enacted sweeping economic reforms that deepened inequalities and provoked democratic resistance. In such a setting, theology, for the members of KCPA, became a means to interpret and transform the world.\n\nThe association’s influence was not confined to academic circles. As the Yushin Constitution was enacted in 1972 and the government enforced a series of Emergency Measures, many KCPA-affiliated professors were forcibly dismissed from their posts. These “dismissed intellectuals” would later form the core of the “Association of Dismissed Professors,” which actively collaborated with Christian student and youth movements, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), and urban-industrial missions. This realignment gave rise to a more engaged form of Christian activism rooted in theological conviction. As Jeong Byeongjun observes, the KCPA became “an intellectual body that contributed to Korea’s democratization movement and Christian social movement by offering theological and ideological resources.”\n\nAt the heart of the KCPA’s theological reorientation was the work of theologian Seo Nam-dong, whose writings powerfully articulated the vision of Minjung as the historic and salvific subject of Korea. Seo did not view the Minjung simply as pitiable victims, but as the true agents of divine history. “The Minjung,” he insisted, “must be recognized as the most significant historical subject in the redemptive work of God, and the Bible must be read anew in the language of the Minjung.” Seo’s interpretation called for a radical redefinition of the church’s role—not as a custodian of tradition, but as a suffering companion of the oppressed.\n\nSuch theological redefinitions found resonance in major events of the 1970s. The 1973 “Korean Christian Declaration” (한국기독교인 선언) and the subsequent 1974 “Theological Declaration of Korean Christians” (한국그리스도인의 신학적 성명) were landmarks in Christian political witness. Composed largely by KCPA-affiliated theologians such as Kim Yong-bok, Kim Kwan-seok, and Seo Nam-dong, these declarations accused the Yushin regime of “betraying the people,” asserting that Christian participation in democratic resistance was “a command of God, a demand of the people, and a historic tradition of the church.” These documents served to theologically legitimize Christian engagement in Korea’s democratization process, and were clandestinely printed and distributed with the blessing of NCCK’s general secretary.\n\nThe integration of theology and political engagement reached a critical juncture with the Mincheonghakryeon (Democratic Youth and Student Federation) incident in 1974. Following a fabricated conspiracy by the state, over 1,000 students were interrogated and more than 200 arrested, including 26 core members of the KSCF (Korean Student Christian Federation). Christian professors, including many from the KCPA, not only supported the students spiritually and materially, but also played a public role in defending their human rights. As the repression intensified, “the NCCK Human Rights Committee became a cradle of ecumenical human rights activism, allowing the church to transcend denominational barriers and stand with the persecuted.”\n\nDespite the regime’s persistent efforts to suppress dissent, KCPA and its partners in the ecumenical movement received significant international solidarity. Organizations such as the WCC, the CCA (Christian Conference of Asia), and various German and Japanese churches provided spiritual, financial, and material support to the Korean Christian resistance. The role of these ecumenical alliances was critical, as “without the international funds and networks, the Korean ecumenical movement in the 1970s and 80s could not have survived.” These transnational connections allowed Korean Christian intellectuals to frame their struggle not merely as a national issue but as part of a global fight for justice.\n\nUltimately, the KCPA’s theological-political praxis represents a unique moment in Korean church history when theology became praxis, and intellectual discourse translated into prophetic action. Theirs was a radical fidelity—to the Gospel, to the people, and to justice in history. Through the work of theologians like Seo Nam-dong and their collaboration with student, labor, and ecumenical groups, the KCPA helped redefine Korean Christianity in a moment of national crisis. They showed that theology could be, and must be, lived in the streets, prisons, and classrooms of a nation under dictatorship.\n\n\nKorean Church Women United (KCWU)\n\n\nThe Korean Church Women United (KCWU) emerged in the 1970s as a prophetic ecumenical force that amplified the silenced voices of women marginalized by the developmentalist ideology of the Park Chung-hee regime.\n\nTheir activities directly confronted the violence and exploitation hidden beneath South Korea’s “modernization of the fatherland” narrative, particularly the commodification of women through state-led sex tourism and the systemic neglect of Korean women affected by the atomic bomb. Lim Hee-sook characterizes this movement as a theological awakening in which women realized that “they, among all people, were the most oppressed under the structure of division” and responded with collective action grounded in faith.\n\nA defining moment came in December 1973, when KCWU hosted a seminar titled “The Problem of Tourists and Prostituted Women”, addressing the rise of sex tourism marketed to Japanese men. The organization released a public statement condemning the state’s complicity: “The economic-first development policy is not only making our nation a virtual colony of Japan but also commodifying Korean women under the guise of tourism promotion.” This act transformed a stigmatized issue into a systemic critique of patriarchal capitalism and marked one of the first public theological denunciations of the Korean state’s use of women’s bodies for profit.\n\nIn the late 1970s, KCWU expanded its focus to include Japanese atomic bomb victims in Korea, especially women whose lives were marked by radiation sickness, social ostracism, and intergenerational suffering. KCWU’s collaboration with Japanese Christian organizations to conduct field investigations gave voice to these women, setting a precedent for future campaigns around the “comfort women” issue. These efforts created the first public platform where such women could speak and be heard—a theological and political breakthrough. As Ko Seong-hwi notes, KCWU’s actions were “not merely humanitarian acts of Christian charity but a direct challenge to patriarchal modernization itself.” Their initiatives redefined Christian women’s activism from church-based charity work to critical engagement with national policy, gendered violence, and global justice.\n\nAccording to Lim’s broader analysis, KCWU’s role in the 1970s marked a paradigm shift in Protestant women’s education and empowerment. Transitioning from traditional evangelism-focused teachings to feminist theology and social engagement, KCWU “enabled women to become subjects of social participation and ecclesial reform.” They embraced a theological understanding of mission not confined to church walls but extending into the world, especially to sites of suffering and exclusion.\n\nKCWU's theological praxis proclaimed that “God’s mission begins not within the sanctuary, but at the margins.” Their work throughout the 1970s contributed significantly to South Korea’s democratization, the Christian feminist movement, and the emergence of human rights advocacy in both church and civil society. They exemplified what it meant to make the body—the most vulnerable site of modern exploitation—a medium of gospel testimony.\n\n\nCatholic Farmers’ Movement (CFM) and Catholic Women Farmers’ Association (CWFA)\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Catholic Farmers’ Movement (CFM) and the Catholic Women Farmers’ Association (CWFA) emerged as faith-based grassroots movements in response to the structural collapse of rural communities caused by rapid industrialization and urban concentration, the political marginalization of farmers, and the compounded oppression of women farmers. These organizations functioned not merely as relief or welfare bodies, but as autonomous collectives aiming to awaken consciousness, organize the rural population, and expose structural injustices. Their work was rooted in diocesan pastoral networks, national coordination, and international partnerships, establishing an alternative model for rural solidarity and cooperation.\n\nThe Catholic Farmers’ Movement originated in 1966 as a rural division of the Catholic Young Workers' Movement and was officially renamed “Catholic Farmers’ Movement” in 1972, expanding its structure into a national rural network. The principal agents of the movement were young farmers, clergy, and rural pastoral workers. Through publishing activities like the journal Nongchon Cheongnyeon (Rural Youth), the movement critically assessed rural realities and denounced state-led policies such as the Saemaul (New Village) Movement and the government’s focus on large-scale farming. As Park Kyung-yeon writes, “The Catholic Farmers’ Movement made it clear that the Church’s role was to realize social justice, and that proper action to achieve this was an appropriate posture,” emphasizing the fusion of religious ethics with socio-political engagement.\n\nOne of the CFM’s most impactful activities was the Rice Production Cost Survey, launched in 1975, which aimed to empirically demonstrate the real costs of rice production by having farmers themselves record detailed data in diary-like formats. This allowed farmers to reclaim recognition of their economic value and critique structural inequalities. According to the research, “Farmers, unlike before, gained confidence and strength... and began raising questions about the irrational agricultural structure and even the political system.” In addition, in the diocese of Wonju, the CFM cooperated with the Disaster Relief Committee to establish credit unions in rural communities. These credit unions, or Shinhyups, not only offered financial services but also engaged in the cooperative production, distribution, and consumption of goods. According to Kim So-nam, “By taking the lead in village governance, credit union officers brought about shifts in local political structures,” thereby democratizing village power that had been dominated by government-backed organizations. These activities, though sometimes parallel to government-led rural policies, represented a distinct and autonomous grassroots model of development.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Women Farmers’ Association was launched in 1977 under the original name “Catholic Rural Women’s Association,” with the goal of empowering women in agriculture and rural life. The inaugural president, Kim Young-ja, declared that “the rural women’s movement is not merely a women’s rights movement but one that tackles agricultural issues at their core… by confronting structural contradictions from the perspective of rural women and offering human dignity-based education and organizing.” The CWFA identified the dual burdens faced by women farmers—agricultural labor and domestic work—as well as the gender-based discrimination embedded within both rural and urban systems. Through their periodical Nongchon Bunya (Rural Women), they engaged in consciousness-raising work and advocated for recognition of women’s roles and rights. Rather than merely asserting women's rights, the CWFA advanced programs for political participation, educational access, and community engagement. One of their symbolic achievements was the 1985 \"Cattle Drive Protest,\" in which women farmers drove cattle into urban areas to protest agricultural policy—an event regarded as the “starting point of women-led farmers’ movements.” The CWFA laid the foundation for the creation of the National Association of Women Farmers in 1989.\n\nBoth organizations shared a common foundation in Catholic social teaching and emphasized consciousness-raising and grassroots organizing. While the CFM focused on cooperatives, cost surveys, and production reform, the CWFA introduced gender perspectives into the farmers’ movement, expanding its scope and constituency.\n\n\nTable 3.

This marked the formal launch of a movement that envisioned evangelism not simply as a matter of personal salvation, but as a collective mission for national spiritual renewal. Kim’s vision was that Korea as a whole should be reached, healed, and transformed by the gospel. This declaration led to a series of nationwide campaigns, beginning with the Chuncheon Holy City Movement and culminating in the historic EXPLO ’74 rally.\n\nThe National Evangelization Movement arose from a convergence of political tension, social transformation, and religious expansion in 1970s Korea. Politically, the Yushin Constitution of 1972 solidified Park Chung Hee's authoritarian regime. Despite its repressive mechanisms, the state permitted a degree of religious freedom when aligned with anti-communist nationalism. The evangelical rhetoric of national moral regeneration complemented the regime’s political ideology, allowing the movement to flourish under tacit approval. Economically and socially, Korea was undergoing rapid industrialization and urban migration, which caused the disintegration of traditional community structures. This left many individuals, particularly in urban slums, in search of new identities and social anchors. Churches stepped into this vacuum, offering a narrative of restoration and spiritual belonging. Religiously, Protestant churches had grown rapidly but were grappling with questions of public engagement. Theologians and church leaders debated whether faith should remain inward or engage with society. Kim Joon Gon reframed this debate by declaring that “the gospel is not complete until it transforms the nation,” thus providing theological legitimacy for mass mobilization.\n\nThe movement’s growth was marked by high-profile campaigns and strategic initiatives that integrated local and global evangelical networks. EXPLO ’74 was the most iconic event. Held in Seoul’s Yeouido Plaza and co-hosted by Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) and Billy Graham, the event drew over a million participants and marked Korea’s emergence as a global evangelical center. It symbolized the scale, ambition, and momentum of the movement. Equally influential was the Chuncheon-based Holy City Movement, launched in 1972. Inspired by Calvin’s Geneva and the ministry of Mun Jun Kyung, Kim Joon Gon envisioned “holistic evangelization,” where churches would spiritually and materially serve entire cities. This strategy emphasized community transformation and civic morality alongside individual salvation.\n\nThe success of the movement was underpinned by the fusion of theological conviction, political accommodation, cultural resonance, and organizational strategy. Theologically, Kim promoted an eschatological narrative in which Korea was a “chosen nation” destined to play a redemptive role in world missions. This “Second Israel” framing made the nation's history of suffering meaningful within a broader salvific story. Politically, the movement benefited from the regime’s indirect support. The government's anti-communist nationalism and desire for social cohesion meant that mass evangelical activities were tolerated, even when not explicitly endorsed. Culturally, the postwar generations were deeply affected by national division, war, and identity loss. The movement provided a unifying spiritual narrative that redefined minjok (the Korean nation) not only ethnically but as a sacred community. Strategically, CCC employed globally developed tools such as the Four Spiritual Laws and small-group discipleship, adapting them to Korean society. Their student networks, lay training, and mobilization tactics made the movement replicable and sustainable nationwide.\n\nThe movement left a transformative legacy on Korean Christianity and public life, despite facing criticism in later years. Within the church, it cemented the norm of mass evangelism and institutionalized lay ministry. CCC’s influence spread into nearly every major denomination, shaping a generation of church leaders and youth ministries. Socially, the movement modeled a form of public theology that envisioned civic life shaped by the gospel. The Holy City Movement, for instance, sought to moralize urban governance, improve public ethics, and embody Christian values in everyday life. However, critics have pointed out its limitations. Its spiritual-nationalist framework aligned too easily with authoritarian ideologies, and it largely avoided engagement with the democratization and human rights movements of the late 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, its cultural and theological impact on the Korean Protestant imagination is undeniable.\n\n\nCatholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) 천주교정의구현사제단\n\nThe Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) emerged in 1970s South Korea as a transformative force in the relationship between religion and politics, forging a new path for the church as a moral agent amid authoritarian rule and institutional silence. More than a reaction to political oppression, its founding and activities reflected a theologically grounded commitment to conscience and justice. The CPAJ was not merely a group of dissenting clergy; it embodied a significant theological movement within Korean Catholicism that asserted the prophetic role of the Church in the public sphere.\n\nThe catalyst for its formation was the arrest of Bishop Ji Hak-sun of the Wonju Diocese on July 6, 1974. He had been detained by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) for allegedly providing funds to poet Kim Chi-ha, who was arrested in connection with the People's Revolutionary Party (Mincheong) incident. Days later, on July 23, Bishop Ji delivered a public “Declaration of Conscience” from the garden of the hospital where he was under house arrest, proclaiming: “I have worked for human dignity and social justice; if that is a crime, I accept responsibility.”This statement reverberated throughout the Catholic community and galvanized younger priests to action, culminating in the organization of “National Prayer Meetings to Save the Nation.”\n\nBishop Ji’s arrest was more than a political incident; it was a theological rupture. For the first time, a senior church leader openly defied the regime, asserting that spiritual responsibility included ethical and political judgment. In response, priests across the country organized themselves under the banner of “justice,” and on September 26, 1974, the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice was officially founded. In a remarkable act of civil disobedience, priests led a procession with a cross at its forefront through the streets of Seoul following a Mass at Myeongdong Cathedral, marking the first street protest led by Catholic clergy in Korean history.\n\nTwo crucial factors shaped this development. First was the impact of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), which declared in Gaudium et Spes that “when the fundamental rights of people or the salvation of souls require it, the Church must pass moral judgment even in political matters”. Second was the increasingly repressive climate of the 1970s under President Park Chung-hee, which saw not only civil liberties curtailed but also the surveillance and persecution of religious organizations. The CPAJ interpreted these acts as violations not just of civil rights but of religious conscience, arguing, “There can be no preaching of the Gospel without justice and freedom”.\n\nOrganizationally, the CPAJ functioned as a loosely connected nationwide network of priests, but their actions were coordinated and symbolically powerful. The primary mode of resistance was the national prayer meeting, which served as both a liturgical and political space. From 1974 through 1980, over 200 such meetings were held across the country, aligned with campaigns against the Yushin Constitution, for the release of political prisoners, and in support of direct presidential elections. Their statements consistently called for the release of conscience prisoners, protection of basic human rights, freedom of religion, and economic justice for the people.\n\nImportantly, the CPAJ’s actions were not uniformly supported within the institutional Church. While the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Korea did not overtly oppose the group, it often remained cautious or silent, maintaining internal balance between progressive and conservative factions. Nonetheless, many within the Church acknowledged that the CPAJ contributed to a “renewed social trust in Catholicism,” particularly among students and intellectuals. Some even noted that the Church’s membership, which had stagnated in the early 1970s, began to increase partly due to the CPAJ’s visible commitment to justice.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the CPAJ had become one of the most respected moral voices in Korean society. Their acts—priests marching with crosses, defying state violence—captured the national imagination and elevated the Catholic Church to a central place in the democratization movement. As one priest stated, “Justice is part of evangelism; standing with the oppressed is the practice of the Gospel itself”.\n\nThe CPAJ’s legacy in 1970s Korea is not simply a record of reactive protest. It is an emblem of how faith, conscience, and theology can become the basis for structural critique and ethical resistance. Through its work, the CPAJ provided a model for how the Church could resist authoritarianism not by abandoning its mission but by embodying it more fully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) 한국기독교교회협의회\n\n\nThe 1980s in South Korea were marked by a triple burden of authoritarian military rule, the unequal effects of rapid industrialization, and the ongoing tension of Cold War division. Citizens’ rights and the livelihoods of the working poor were often sacrificed in the name of national security and economic growth. In this context, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) emerged not just as an ecumenical body of denominations, but as a prophetic actor in the fields of democratization, human rights, and reunification.\n\nIn 1983, the NCCK made a bold public theological statement, declaring that the division of the Korean peninsula was not merely a geopolitical or political issue but a matter of Christian faith.\n\n“Division is the root of poverty, dictatorship, and the threat of nuclear war. Overcoming division is the very act of living out our faith.” This declaration was groundbreaking. At the time, public discourse about reunification was often treated as subversive or pro-North Korean. By claiming that the issue was central to Christian mission, NCCK gave churches a theological rationale for public engagement in peace and unification.\n\nThis theological conviction translated into action. In 1986, representatives from NCCK and the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) of North Korea held an unofficial civil-level dialogue in Glion, Switzerland, marking the first meeting between Protestant representatives from both Koreas outside of governmental control.\n\n“The Glion Meeting marked a historic turning point where North and South Korean Christians, beyond ideology and borders, sought a vision of national reconciliation.” Between 1986 and 1988, three such meetings were held. These meetings demonstrated that the churches of North and South could form bonds based on shared faith, even in a deeply divided land.\n\nOne theological bridge between NCCK and its North Korean counterparts lay in the convergence of Minjung theology and Juche ideology. “Minjung theology and Juche thought both placed the oppressed people or ‘masses’ at the center of history, opening a space for meaningful inter-ideological dialogue.” Minjung theology, rooted in Korean struggles, declared that Jesus is present among the suffering people and that faith must be enacted in solidarity with the oppressed. This made inter-Korean dialogue a matter of Christian vocation.\n\nSuch moves, however, provoked state repression. In 1985, when the NCCK attempted to hold a church-led national reunification conference, the government banned it under the National Security Law. In response, the NCCK released a public statement outlining its “Three Principles for Reunification”:\n\nReunification is not the sole task of the state—it is the responsibility of all citizens.\n\nBoth regimes must not use division as a tool for preserving power.\n\nChristians have both the freedom and responsibility to engage in reunification efforts.\n\nThis declaration challenged the government’s monopoly over national identity, insisting that faith-based civil society had a legitimate voice in political life.\n\nWhat enabled NCCK to sustain such prophetic activities, despite pressure and surveillance, was its deep connection with the global ecumenical movement. Churches in West Germany, the World Council of Churches (WCC), and Christian Aid provided financial and moral support. In 1978, NCCK’s total annual income reached 158.46 million KRW, of which over 110.57 million KRW (about 70%) came from foreign church grants. Major contributors included BfW (49.9%), WCC (21%), Christian Aid, ICCO, and NCCUSA. These funds empowered NCCK to maintain its independence and pursue social justice initiatives.\n\nThe aid wasn’t limited to declarations. It funded on-the-ground projects for marginalized populations. In 1972, Brot für die Welt (BfW) signed a formal agreement to support urban mission work in Korea through Project P1732, contributing 203,000 Deutsche Marks. These funds enabled NCCK to support poor urban communities, displaced workers, and emerging grassroots activists.\n\nA particularly important figure in mobilizing global support was Oh Jae-shik, who served in WCC and CCA urban mission bodies. Through his efforts, the WCC URM budget expanded from $5,000 to $2 million. Half of that budget was designated for Asia, and $500,000 was directed to Korean projects, including:\n\nindustrial mission centers\n\nliving expenses for dismissed professors\n\naid for families of political prisoners\n\npublication of the progressive magazine Mal\n\nfounding of environmental justice institutes\n\n“Much of the $500,000 raised by Oh Jae-shik was used to support Korea’s urban industrial mission, dismissed professors, and political prisoners' families.”⁷ These efforts transformed NCCK into a channel for international pressure against authoritarianism and a conduit for civil society building in Korea.\n\nInternally, NCCK’s activism also reshaped Korean Christian theology. Thinkers like Jürgen Moltmann (Theology of Hope), Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Theology of Resistance), and the Barmen Declaration from Germany influenced Korean theologians. These ideas merged with Minjung theology, helping to formulate the belief that \"human rights activism is itself Christian mission.\"\n\n“The courage and faith of the Korean church under severe repression moved many in the German churches. We Christians have much to learn from them.” — Testimony of Dorothea Schweitzer\n\nIn conclusion, the NCCK of the 1980s stood as more than an ecclesiastical institution. It became a faith-based agent of social transformation, embodying what it meant to resist dictatorship, heal national division, and stand with the suffering. Its work offers a model of how religion, when rooted in solidarity and justice, can challenge the powers of its time and offer hope to a broken nation.\n\n\nTable 12.

Under the leadership of Rev. Kim Joon-gon, CCC transitioned from a campus-focused ministry to one that envisioned evangelizing the entire nation and sending missionaries across the globe. This vision was actualized through a multi-layered strategy that encompassed personal evangelism, systematic discipleship training, international missions, and cultural ministries.\n\nOne of CCC’s most well-known methods was personal evangelism using gospel tracts, particularly the Four Spiritual Laws. CCC staff and student leaders frequently visited campuses to conduct one-on-one evangelism, explaining salvation through a concise four-point structure: God’s plan, humanity’s sin, Jesus’ sacrifice, and salvation through faith. This approach quickly became a model for campus evangelism nationwide and was recognized for its systematic and scalable format​.\n\nFollowing evangelism, CCC implemented a rigorous, multi-stage discipleship training system. The training followed a five-step trajectory: personal nurturing → basic cell groups (순모임) → discipleship training → leadership training → mission sending. Small group Bible studies, quiet time practices, and prayer meetings were conducted under the supervision of campus staff and student leaders (순장). These structured programs not only deepened spiritual formation but also influenced lay leadership training programs in many Korean churches​.\n\nDuring this decade, CCC organized massive nationwide revival and training events such as the National Evangelization Leadership Training Conferences, Explo ’74, and the 1980 World Evangelization Convention. These events combined mass worship with residential evangelism training, in which ordinary students were trained as evangelists and small group Bible study leaders through an intensive living and learning experience. These students were then dispatched to churches and campuses across the country. Kim Joon-gon proclaimed this as a movement “to revolutionize the nation through the gospel, mobilizing two million Christians”​.\n\nCCC also expanded into overseas missions during the 1980s. The organization began organizing short-term mission trips to countries such as the Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan, and later started deploying long-term missionaries. In the 1990s, CCC launched “New Life 2000,” a major overseas outreach project that involved sending mission teams and church planters abroad. Along with training during retreats, CCC aligned with international evangelical conferences and developed a long-term missionary sending infrastructure​.\n\nCCC’s cultural ministry also flourished in the 1980s. The group formed over a dozen gospel music teams—including Good Life and Crossroads—which performed domestically and internationally as part of its praise evangelism strategy. CCC also dubbed the internationally renowned JESUS film into Korean and established an audiovisual department to support film-based evangelism. In 1989, the professional praise team Mobil was formed, elevating CCC's presence in Christian media and culture​.\n\nThrough these activities, CCC became more than a campus ministry—it emerged as the flagship of conservative evangelical student movements in South Korea. However, its emphasis on national revival and its cooperative stance with authoritarian governments drew criticism from progressive Christian student groups like KSCF, who saw CCC’s message as politically conservative and disconnected from the suffering of marginalized groups. Nevertheless, CCC’s well-organized strategies, training models, and cultural productions significantly shaped the trajectory of Korean Protestantism. Many of CCC’s alumni went on to become prominent pastors, missionaries, and leaders in church and society​.\n\n\nKorean Student Christian Federation (KSF) 한국기독학생회총연맹 \n\nThe 1980s was a turbulent decade in South Korea, marked by authoritarian rule, state violence, and widespread social unrest. In this context, the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), a progressive ecumenical Christian student movement, played a significant role in linking Christian faith to the people’s struggle for democracy and justice.\n\nOne of the most defining events for KSCF in this decade was the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980, when government troops brutally suppressed pro-democracy protesters. For many Christian students, the massacre in Gwangju became a moment of spiritual and political awakening. KSCF interpreted the uprising not only as a political tragedy but as a call for prophetic Christian action. According to internal testimonies, \"telling the truth about Gwangju was itself an act of faith.\" KSCF organized Bible studies and memorial services to reflect on the event theologically, often under government surveillance. These activities positioned the group as a rare voice of moral resistance within the student and church communities.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the authoritarian regime banned or tightly regulated student unions and organizations. KSCF responded by revitalizing its grassroots student base through alternative networks. A major initiative was the expansion of the Haksadan (Student Social Development Unit). Through this program, KSCF students immersed themselves in marginalized communities. For instance, Yonsei University students engaged with displaced urban poor in the Yeonhui-dong apartment district; Korea University students worked in the polluted industrial zone of Jongam-dong; and Kyung Hee University students investigated social conditions in the slums along Cheonggyecheon stream. These on-the-ground experiences were not just community service but were framed as acts of discipleship, intended to align Christian practice with Jesus' solidarity with the oppressed.\n\nIn addition, KSCF’s commitment to critical theology led it to adopt and reinterpret minjung theology, a Korean contextual theology that identifies the \"minjung\" (the oppressed masses) as the primary subject of God’s redemptive work. Bible reading and worship became tools for social awareness. KSCF facilitated nationwide Bible study campaigns, emphasizing stories of the Hebrew exodus and Jesus’ ministry among the poor. These studies inspired many students to consider their faith in terms of justice, liberation, and structural change. One student from this era recalled, \"Our Bible study on Exodus gave us the courage to speak out against dictatorship and to act in solidarity with laborers and farmers.\"\n\nKSCF also attempted to rebuild student associations that had been disbanded by the military regime. After the government loosened some restrictions in 1983, KSCF members on several campuses helped reestablish full-fledged student councils by 1984. This reorganization enabled Christian students to publicly engage in university reform, human rights advocacy, and anti-war protests alongside secular student groups. Despite pressure from both the state and conservative church circles, KSCF persisted in acting as a bridge between the church and democratization movements.\n\nThe group, however, faced internal tensions. Some members, influenced by Marxist analysis, questioned whether Christian faith was compatible with revolutionary activism. Others remained committed to the unique value of theological critique. This ideological tension sometimes led to fragmentation. Yet, many within KSCF sought to synthesize faith and action, claiming that \"revolution without faith becomes ideology, and faith without justice becomes hypocrisy.\"\n\nKSCF’s work had far-reaching effects. Within the church, it challenged traditional youth ministries and inspired local congregations to rethink their role in society. Outside the church, its public witness helped to counter the dominant image of Christianity as an ally of the military regime. Many KSCF alumni went on to become leaders in NGOs, labor unions, human rights organizations, and peace movements.\n\nIn sum, the Korea Student Christian Federation in the 1980s modeled a theology that was both reflective and revolutionary. Grounded in scripture, committed to justice, and incarnated in the lives of the oppressed, KSCF embodied a form of discipleship that refused to separate faith from history. Through protests, prayer vigils, Bible studies, and grassroots organizing, it shaped a generation of Christian activists who carried their vision well beyond campus walls.\n\n\nYMCA \n\n\nThe 1980s was a period of dramatic transformation for the Korean YMCA, especially in cities like Seoul and Gwangju, where the organization emerged as a visible and trusted actor in South Korea’s democratization and civil society movements. Though originally formed as a Christian youth service organization, the YMCA began to redefine itself as a movement grounded in people-centered theology, democratic engagement, and local empowerment.\n\nOne of the most powerful examples of this shift occurred during the May 18 Gwangju Uprising in 1980, when citizens in the southwestern city of Gwangju rose up against the newly installed military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan. The uprising was met with extreme military violence, leaving hundreds dead. In the midst of this crisis, the Gwangju YMCA opened its auditorium and meeting rooms to citizen leaders, grieving families, and prayer gatherings. When martial law banned all public meetings, “the YMCA auditorium on Geumnam-ro remained the only place where prayers for justice could be spoken aloud.” YMCA leaders also participated in citizen mediation efforts and preserved testimonies of the massacre, even as the central YMCA leadership avoided direct political confrontation.\n\nIn Seoul, the Yonsei University YMCA (SCA) was expanding its vision of Christian discipleship through immersion-based ministry. In 1982, 39 students were sent into Korea’s most marginalized areas, including the Nanjido landfill (a massive garbage mountain), leprosy colonies, and the Pulmuwon farming cooperative. These student volunteers did not visit briefly—they lived alongside the residents, sharing meals and daily labor. One participant recalled, “Living in the community became a form of spiritual formation, where we interpreted the suffering of the poor through the lens of faith.”\n\nThis theology of incarnation and resistance led to further experimentation. In 1983 and 1984, students from the Yonsei SCA launched a rural cooperative experiment in the Namyangman region, promoting collective farming, economic self-reliance, and Christian community. “The Namyangman project was not about charity,” a leader explained, “but about modeling an alternative society grounded in cooperation, reflection, and faith.”\n\nThis work was sustained by intellectual formation. Yonsei YMCA initiated the Nuruk Bible School and hosted a series of lectures by leading Christian thinkers such as Ham Seok-heon, Jang Il-jo, and Kim Jae-joon, addressing topics like Marxism, revolution, and technocracy. These conversations reflected a yearning among students to build a “Christian language that could make sense of injustice, exploitation, and dictatorship.”\n\nWhile these activities were rooted in faith, they also reshaped public life. Many Yonsei SCA alumni went on to lead YMCA branches across the country—in Seoul, Incheon, Busan, Daejeon, and Daegu—spreading a model of socially engaged Christianity grounded in civil society leadership. “Many SCA graduates became YMCA leaders across the country and shaped Korea’s faith-based civic culture.”\n\nTheologically and institutionally, the 1980s was also the decade in which the Korean YMCA formally embraced its activist identity. In 1976, it had already revised its mission statement, inspired by the World YMCA’s Kampala Declaration, which called for democratization, economic justice, and people-centered development. By the early 1980s, YMCA leaders like Kang Moon-kyu spoke openly about the need to serve not just the young, but the “suffering people (minjung),” redefining YMCA as a “functional church”—a church in movement and solidarity.”\n\nBy the end of the decade, YMCA had become one of Korea’s most respected civil organizations, engaging in campaigns for labor rights, environmental sustainability, and community-based economic justice. Its prayer meetings became protests, and its service programs became political testimonies—making the 1980s a defining chapter in the re-Christianization of Korea’s civic space.\n\n\nYWCA\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Korean YWCA emerged as one of the few Christian organizations where women could engage in faith-based activism at the intersection of gender justice, democracy, and daily survival. While its national office maintained a cautious stance under authoritarian rule, many local YWCA chapters developed a bold and practical theology grounded in the lived experiences of working-class women.\n\nThe most dramatic episode unfolded in Gwangju during the May 18 Uprising of 1980, when citizens resisted the military coup led by Chun Doo-hwan. As troops opened fire on unarmed civilians, local churches and organizations were paralyzed by fear or shut down entirely. But the Gwangju YWCA remained open, providing space for prayer, rest, and strategic discussion among community members. According to one researcher, “YWCA leaders participated in the citizens’ mediation committee and supported post-trauma healing for women and youth in the wake of the massacre.” Though the national YWCA could not issue public statements, these local actions spoke powerfully to the organization’s rootedness in community care and justice.\n\nIn Seoul and other urban centers, the YWCA addressed a different kind of crisis: the everyday injustice faced by women workers. The 1980s marked a period of explosive industrialization in South Korea, during which many women found work in factories under exploitative conditions. In response, YWCA programs focused on vocational training, legal rights education, and occupational safety for working-class women. One staff member recalled, “We were not theologians; we were Christian women in the field, struggling to bring prayer and protest together.”\n\nIn 1985, the Seoul YWCA launched its Women’s Labor Counseling Center, where factory workers—many in their teens and early twenties—could seek help for wage theft, sexual harassment, and industrial injuries. These services were often delivered by volunteers trained in both legal literacy and Christian counseling. Through this work, the YWCA built a new model of Christian service: not charitable aid, but solidarity rooted in shared faith and feminist consciousness.\n\nAs part of its theological formation, YWCA organized a range of public education programs such as the “Wednesday Lecture Series” and “Minjung Women’s Roundtables.” These events explored the role of women in democratization, theology, and social transformation. For example, one roundtable in Gwangju brought together theologians, farmers, labor activists, and survivors of political violence to ask: How can Christian women respond to injustice not only with compassion but with collective power?\n\nAlthough not directly aligned with liberation theology or the minjung theology movement, the YWCA articulated what some scholars have called a “praxis-based Christian feminism.” This approach emphasized incarnation, service, and justice over ideological dogma. It grounded its theology not in abstract doctrine but in the realities of domestic violence, unequal labor, and silenced voices. As one participant put it, “We found Christ in the sewing machines, in the strike shelters, and in the tears of single mothers.”\n\nThe impact of the 1980s YWCA extended both within and beyond the church. Inside the church, it created space for laywomen’s leadership and challenged male-dominated authority structures. Outside the church, it trained a generation of Christian women activists who would go on to found NGOs, join peace movements, and influence public policy. In doing so, YWCA redefined what it meant to be a faithful Christian woman in an age of rapid change and deep injustice.\n\n\nNCC Thursday Prayer Meetings\n\n\nThis Meeting began in the midst of the authoritarian Yushin regime in the 1970s and grew throughout the 1980s into a space of solidarity and resistance—a living embodiment of Korean Christianity’s faith-in-action during times of suffering.\n\nThe prayer meetings began on July 18, 1974, as a response to widespread arrests under the Yushin regime’s emergency decrees. Countless student activists and democracy advocates were imprisoned, and many Christian pastors felt compelled to respond. Leaders from the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)—including Kim Sang-geun, Lee Hae-dong, and Moon Dong-hwan—gathered regularly with families of detainees at the Christian Building in Jongno, Seoul, for what they called the “Regular Thursday Prayer Meeting with the Incarcerated.” Over time, it expanded into the “Regular Thursday Prayer Meeting for the Realization of Justice and Freedom.” On April 10, 1975, the day after the rushed executions of eight individuals connected to the Inhyeokdang case, prayer meeting attendees rushed to the mortuary and were forcibly detained by police while trying to prevent the seizure of the victims’ bodies. This incident made clear that the Thursday gatherings were not just religious rituals—they were public acts of protest against state violence.\n\nAs the years passed, the themes and scope of the meetings grew. From 1977, the voices of workers suffering from exploitation and dismissal began to take center stage. Meetings featured handwritten petitions and appeals from women laborers at factories such as Banglim Spinning and Samgosa. These events marked the expansion of the prayer meeting from a focus on students and political dissidents to a broader platform that included workers and farmers as well.At the July 22, 1977 prayer meeting, a young worker named Kim Il-sim, who had been harassed and relocated for attending the Christian Industrial Mission, read a heartfelt statement: “Is it really such a crime to attend the Industrial Mission? I’ve done nothing wrong except ask for my rightful overtime pay and join a church group that prays for workers like me.” These testimonies reveal how the prayer meetings became not only a space for elite or student dissidents, but also a platform for the working poor to speak their truth.\n\nThese developments brought greater surveillance and violence. On September 22, 1979, during a special prayer meeting for dismissed workers from Dongil Spinning attended by over 500 people, plainclothes officers stormed the building and brutally beat participants. The incident became known as the “9/22 Christian Building Incident.” Police attacked pastors, women, students, and workers alike. One woman was dragged down the stairs by her hair. Another female student was kicked in the chest. Pastor Cho Hwa-soon was beaten unconscious and carried away in a police van. Despite dozens being detained, the Friday prayer meetings did not stop; rather, they gained renewed urgency and attention.\n\nThe early 1980s marked a period of darkness. Following the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, the newly entrenched military regime further clamped down. The prayer meetings could no longer be held openly and were replaced by visits to detainees’ families and small, private worship services. But on February 11, 1982, they resumed under the new name: “Thursday Worship with Those Who Suffer.” These services took place twice a month and continued to highlight state abuses. For example, in April 1983, after reports emerged of students being beaten en masse at Seodaemun Detention Center, the prayer meeting became a site for public denunciations, with families reading petitions and protest letters. NCC leaders even visited the Ministry of Justice, calling for an independent investigation. This showed that the prayer meetings were not merely spiritual gatherings but an active platform for human rights advocacy and action.\n\nIn May 1984, the prayer meetings regained their weekly format and began a new phase of growth. Attendance surged, and speakers from a wide range of denominations, regions, and professions joined the pulpit. Among them, Pastor Park Hyung-kyu delivered more than ten sermons during the 1980s and was arrested after offering a benediction on October 30, 1986. These years saw the meetings serve as a sanctuary and stage for victims of the Gwangju Uprising, families of political prisoners, workers suffering from unpaid wages, and others in the margins. The meetings cultivated solidarity and a spirit of shared resistance among churches, advocacy organizations, and civil society.\n\nThe meetings also had a global reach. Korean diasporic communities in Los Angeles, New York, Germany, and Canada held Thursday Prayer Meetings in solidarity, publishing updates in human rights newsletters and staging their own protests. In 1985, a solidarity prayer meeting was held in New York for the Dongil Spinning workers, involving both Korean-Americans and members of the global ecumenical movement. This demonstrated that the meetings were not confined to Korea—they had become a node in the worldwide Christian struggle for justice and human dignity.\n\nUltimately, the NCC Thursday Prayer Meetings were far more than a church ritual. They were sacred spaces of lament, hope, and protest, where Christian faith confronted authoritarianism head-on. Through them, the tears of the suffering were transformed into shared cries for justice. Those who read prayers, wept for the detained, or were arrested for offering sermons stood together—not as political actors alone, but as the body of Christ seeking God's justice and mercy in a broken society.\n\n\nKorean Diakonia Sisterhood\n\n\nOne of the most distinctive identities of the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood lies in its embodiment of a “Protestant monastic community.” Traditionally, the concept of a monastery in Korean society has been associated exclusively with Catholicism. However, the Diakonia Sisterhood challenged this assumption and opened up an entirely new possibility for a monastic life rooted in Protestant theology. They neither wore habits nor took lifelong vows, but they established communal rules and lived a daily rhythm of prayer, work, and learning—embodying a monastic way of life in every sense.\n\nTheir life was “not a cloistered withdrawal but a monastic practice of prayer and service within the reality of everyday life.” One sister recalled, “We had no habits, and we didn’t take lifelong vows like in traditional orders, but our life was monastic in every way. We prayed, worked, ate together, and started and ended each day with Scripture and sharing.”\n\nThis Protestant monastic spirituality aimed at “living a contemplative life within daily activities.” As one scholar described, “Their spirituality was a Martha-like mode of life, where contemplative silence and active service were seamlessly integrated.” In this way, the sisters lived out God's will through both silence and action: tending to the sick, working in the fields, and revitalizing the village community. Their daily rhythm made no distinction between prayer and work. “The Sisterhood prayed while working and worked while praying. It was a new form of monastery that experienced God’s presence not behind walls, but in the midst of the world.”\n\nThe community's spiritual foundation drew from Lutheran monastic traditions, Bonhoeffer’s Life Together, and the practical demands of Minjung theology. Deeply influenced by Bonhoeffer, they demonstrated “that Protestants, too, could live a monastic life in real practice.” Ahn Byung-mu notably encouraged women “to break free from the confines of marriage and domestic labor, to embrace celibacy as a theological choice, and to live a monastic life in solidarity with the oppressed.”In this sense, the Diakonia Sisterhood’s significance lies in how it “redefined the model of a traditional monastery and proposed a new vision of monastic life possible even within Protestantism.”\n\n\nDemocratic Society Construction Council (Minjon)\n\n\nThe Democratic Society Construction Council (Minjon), active in Germany, was officially established on March 1, 1974, following an anti-Yushin dictatorship rally held at Beethoven Square in Bonn. This gathering went beyond a mere statement against the Yushin regime—it was a declaration of intent to launch a full-fledged democratization movement. At the event, participants read aloud the “Declaration for the Construction of a Democratic Society,” signaling organized resistance to the regime. The statement proclaimed, “In solidarity with the Korean people’s struggle to reclaim freedom and human dignity under the oppression and fear of the Yushin system, we will continue our efforts here in Germany to build a democratic society”.\n\nThe council brought together Koreans from diverse social backgrounds in Germany—students, miners, nurses, and religious workers—forming a rare coalition. According to early membership records, about 45.5% were students, with the remainder made up of miners and nurses. Their solidarity was more than cross-class cooperation—it was a transnational experiment in diaspora democracy, requiring the coordination of different political strategies, languages, and sensibilities.\n\nFrom its inception, Minjon sought to move beyond the confines of an intellectual student circle. A defining case of concrete action was the 1975 Balzheim mine incident. After receiving reports of human rights violations involving Korean miners, Minjon organized its own fact-finding delegation. The team collaborated closely with the German press and civil society, bringing the issue to public attention. For the first time, German society raised formal questions about the Korean government’s overseas labor policy and its compatibility with international human rights standards.\n\nAnother major activity was international solidarity efforts for the release of political prisoners. Minjon supported the release of Kim Ji-ha and Kim Dae-jung through joint statements and campaigns with Amnesty International and German churches. With the help of Professor Günter Freudenberg, Minjon founded the Korea Committee (Korea Komitee), which later evolved into the Korea Verband. Freudenberg stated, “What is happening in Korea is not just their problem. An affront to democracy anywhere must be resisted everywhere”. Through this international network, Minjon succeeded in reframing Korean issues within the global human rights agenda.\n\nOne of the most emblematic examples of this international solidarity was the campaign to save Kim Dae-jung, who had been sentenced to death in 1980 by the Korean military regime. Minjon viewed this not as an individual case, but as a critical moment for Korean democracy itself, and launched a wide-scale campaign aimed at galvanizing global public opinion.\n\nA particularly noteworthy episode involved direct political intervention by the German Protestant Church. In November 1980, Minjon sent a petition to the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) and other major denominations. Soon, leaders from the Lutheran and other Protestant churches issued formal requests to the South Korean government to halt Kim Dae-jung’s execution. One such statement read, “Christians do not remain silent in the face of state violence that threatens life.” This declaration was drafted by Minjon activist Lee Sam-yeol in English and later translated and distributed in German and Korean.\n\nThese international appeals soon translated into diplomatic action. Some members of the German Bundestag raised parliamentary questions regarding the suppression of political freedom in Korea, and the German Foreign Office conveyed human rights concerns through unofficial channels to the South Korean embassy. To support these efforts, Minjon compiled English-language summaries and Korean newspaper clippings on Kim Dae-jung’s case and mailed them directly to German lawmakers and media outlets. This rescue campaign became a sophisticated transnational civic movement that combined advocacy, translation, lobbying, and coalition-building.\n\nAnother urgent priority for Minjon was uncovering the truth behind the Gwangju Uprising of May 1980. After the South Korean media and government portrayed the movement as a violent insurrection, Minjon worked from late 1980 onward to inform the international community of the massacre’s actual scale. They formed a “Gwangju Truth-Finding International Support Committee” with Korean students, miners, and nurses in Germany, and held “Gwangju Uprising Testimony Forums” in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich. These forums featured photographs smuggled out of Korea and testimonies from bereaved families, exposing the indiscriminate killings and press censorship under the military junta.\n\nIn 1981, in collaboration with progressive German journalists, Minjon held a photo exhibition titled “The Truth of Gwangju” (Die Wahrheit von Kwangju) at the Frankfurt City Hall gallery. At the opening ceremony, SPD lawmaker Hans-Georg Werner declared, “What happened in Gwangju is no different from what happened under Hitler’s rule,” sparking international shock. Major German newspapers subsequently covered the Gwangju Massacre in detail. In response, the South Korean government attempted to control damage by pressuring Korean consulates and student associations in Germany to censor such narratives.\n\nFar beyond a passive conduit for information, Minjon became a platform for preserving the memory of Gwangju and enabling truth-seeking in Korea through transnational solidarity. From 1982 onward, Minjon held annual memorials for the Gwangju Uprising in major German cities, attended by German citizens, professors, labor unions, and Christian leaders. Activists such as Song Du-yul, Lee Sam-yeol, and Jeong Gyu-myeong emphasized that “The truth of Gwangju is not just a Korean issue—it is a matter of global conscience,” framing remembrance as a moral imperative for humanity.\n\nThese two campaigns—rescuing Kim Dae-jung and uncovering the truth about Gwangju—are not only milestones in the struggle for Korean democracy. They also demonstrate how Minjon, operating from Germany, built a transnational field of resistance in cooperation with churches, civil society, and the media. These efforts elevated Korean issues onto the global stage and allowed diaspora Koreans to emerge not merely as students or refugees, but as historical actors in their own right.\n\nNonetheless, Minjon's activities were repeatedly threatened by external surveillance and internal discord. The Korean Central Intelligence Agency, working with the South Korean Embassy in Germany, labeled Minjon members as communists, denied them re-entry visas, and harassed their families. Some members ultimately abandoned plans to return home and lived in de facto political exile. After the Gwangju massacre, many in the organization experienced disillusionment, realizing that the fall of the Yushin regime would not automatically usher in democracy. This led to diminished morale and decreased participation.\n\nMinjon also developed in close collaboration with Christian figures and institutions. Leaders such as Lee Sam-yeol, Park Sang-jeung, and Lee Sang-chul connected the movement to the World Council of Churches (WCC) and Protestant networks in Germany, raising the movement’s legitimacy and visibility. A key moment was the 1975 Geneva conference, where the Christian Democratic Fellowship (CDDF) was launched, providing a theological basis for Minjon’s political activism. These Christian activists proclaimed that the Gospel should be lived “in solidarity with the oppressed” and that resistance to dictatorship was an act of faith.\n\nStill, Minjon faced criticism from within the church. As more Marxist-inclined students and activists took leadership, some in the Christian community felt the group was losing its religious neutrality and becoming overly political. This tension came to a head in 1977, when Minjon debated whether to join the National Alliance for Democratic Reunification (Hanminryeon). The ideological division between Christian and secular factions prompted some members to withdraw from the group.\n\nDespite these challenges, Minjon left a lasting impact on Korea’s democratization movement. The release of Kim Dae-jung, global awareness of the Gwangju Massacre, and international critiques of Korea’s human rights record all owed much to Minjon’s informational and advocacy efforts. The organization’s legacy lived on through its successor, the Association of Korean National-Democratic Movements in Europe (Yureop Minhyeop), which continued the democratization and reunification movement into the late 1980s. More than a single organization, Minjon became a model for how diasporic Koreans could organize across borders, sustain political memory, and influence history from afar.\n\n\nChristian Democratic Fellowship\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Christian Democratic Fellowship of Koreans (CDFK), based in Germany, stood out as a unique example of faith-based democratic resistance within the Korean diaspora. Responding to the political repression and human rights violations of the era, CDFK emerged not as a formally established organization at a fixed moment, but rather as a fellowship organically formed by Korean Christians in Germany—many of whom, like Yi Sam-yŏl, Chŏng Chi-yŏng, and Yi Chin-san, had earlier participated in the Democratic Society Construction Council (민건). Their shared conviction was clear: “faith and democracy are inseparable.”\n\nOne of the most urgent issues to which CDFK responded was the 1980 Gwangju Uprising and, more critically, the Korean church’s silence regarding the massacre. CDFK interpreted the events in Gwangju not as a regional or political disturbance but as a theological event demanding a faith-based response. In a statement issued on June 5, 1980 in Bonn, they declared:\n\n“God stands with the oppressed, and the innocent victims in Gwangju bear the image of Christ on the cross. Their blood cries out to heaven, and the church on earth must no longer remain a co-conspirator in silence. We respond to the cries of the Gwangju people in the name of faith, and call the Korean church to repentance and awakening.”\n\nThis statement was partially published in a German Protestant periodical and led to joint prayer services with groups such as the Berliner ökumenischer Friedenskreis. On June 10, CDFK organized solidarity demonstrations in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Hamburg, drawing around 300 participants, including German citizens, Korean workers, and students. At one such rally, Yi Sam-yŏl gave a speech proclaiming:\n\n“The Korean church is turning away from the cross. Gwangju is not only the pain of the southern provinces; it is a judgment upon all believers. CDFK gathers here today to ask what it means to be the church on the side of God.”\n\nFrom 1981 onward, CDFK held annual memorial prayer services for Gwangju, collaborating with German Protestant congregations. These services included communal worship, moments of silence, and open reflection. In 1982, the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) regional newsletter even reported on these gatherings. CDFK also maintained active correspondence and solidarity with South Korean Christian resistance groups, particularly the NCCK Human Rights Committee and the Christian Social Action Council in Seoul. In 1985, when the NCCK published its Social Participation Declaration, CDFK issued a public statement of support and translated the document into German, distributing it to WCC-affiliated bodies and church groups throughout Europe.\n\nBeyond institutional ties, CDFK also maintained informal connections with student and youth resistance organizations such as KSCF and Minchŏngryŏn, exchanging news and publications. In 1986, a CDFK member gave a presentation titled “The Church’s Responsibility in Korea’s Democratization” at the WCC Youth Forum, further solidifying their role as a bridge between Korean and international Christian movements.\n\nDuring the June 1987 Democracy Movement, CDFK again took public action, organizing rallies and issuing a powerful statement titled “A Confession and Plea from Christians”. It read:\n\n“We are watching Korea’s June from Germany. God is on the side of truth and liberation, not falsehood and oppression. We ask Korean Christians: whom does your faith serve?”\n\nThis message was sent directly to the NCCK and excerpts were printed in Seoul-based Christian newsletters.\n\nIn 1988, CDFK added its voice to an international joint statement calling for inter-Korean church dialogue. Taking the initiative, CDFK sent letters proposing a North-South Korean Christian joint prayer service to both the Presbyterian Church (Hapdong) and the Korean Methodist Church. The reaction was swift: Hapdong denounced the proposal as “a theological compromise with socialism,” and several conservative Korean pastors in Germany followed suit, denouncing CDFK in Korean-language diaspora newspapers as a “political agitation group” corrupting the Gospel.\n\nIn response, CDFK published a theological counter-statement, asserting:\n\n“Our call for national reconciliation is not an ideological compromise but a restoration of peace and life based on God’s creative order. The church must stop cloaking division and enmity in the language of faith.”\n\nThis exchange highlighted a growing theological divide between progressive and conservative churches—particularly around the notion of a mission-driven vision of unification. Despite strong opposition, CDFK remained committed to what they called a “theology of reconciliation” and a “faith that crosses the lines of division.” Their example inspired later generations of diaspora Christians to consider public justice, democracy, and unification as core expressions of their religious calling.\n\n\nTable 13.

While the movement narrative explores their theological motivations and historical impact, this table presents their organizational features at a glance, allowing readers to quickly grasp their origins, structure, key figures, ideological orientation, and geographical scope.\n\nImportantly, this side-by-side format highlights how both groups—though differing in form—shared a foundational link to Christianity. Minjeon included many Christian individuals motivated by a progressive faith-based conscience, even if the organization itself was not explicitly religious. In contrast, CDFK was formed explicitly on Christian theological grounds, with prayer, worship, and ecumenical dialogue at the core of its activities.\n\nBy placing these organizations in comparison, the table illustrates how Christian ethics and theology shaped not only their values but also their modes of resistance. This context sets the stage for understanding the theological-political praxis that unfolds more fully in the subsequent movement section.\n\n\nCatholic Priests’ Association for Justice\n\n\nThe Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) in the 1980s transformed religion into a means of achieving public justice. It became one of the most powerful and consistent expressions of faith-based action in South Korea’s democratization movement. CPAJ connected faith with justice, prayer with protest, and the church with civil society, standing against state violence and authoritarian rule. Most significantly, their practice extended beyond church walls and mobilized the public with dynamic energy.\n\nPrayer was not silence, and street marches were not retreat. From 1986 to 1987, priests led protest marches following prayer vigils at least 17 times, restoring the tradition of public resistance by religious figures that had been nearly extinguished since the Yushin regime. During the constitutional reform crisis of 1987, almost every Catholic diocese in the country participated in hunger strikes—transforming individual suffering into an unprecedented nationwide religious action.\n\nMyeongdong Cathedral was more than a place of worship. It became the only \"sanctuary\" in a city paralyzed by the Park Chung-hee regime, and CPAJ turned it into a refuge for democracy. At certain moments, 300 to 400 priests gathered to celebrate Mass for justice, constituting an unparalleled collective act of priestly resistance in Korean religious history. As vigils, fasts, declarations, and marches were repeated, CPAJ established itself as an independent body within the church. In 1989 alone, CPAJ organized nine “Prayer Vigils for Democracy and National Reunification” across the country, each accompanied by hunger strikes and public statements. This consistent, nationwide mobilization was no longer just religious observance—it was the formation of a spiritual movement. These actions also elevated the Catholic Church’s social status. Over a ten-year period, the number of Catholic believers in South Korea doubled, suggesting that CPAJ’s influence extended beyond political resistance to strengthening the identity and growth of the faith community. CPAJ’s impact was not strategic church expansion—it was a natural consequence of speaking truth through faith.\n\nCPAJ extended its resistance beyond domestic boundaries by forming international Christian networks, notably with the World Council of Churches (WCC). Their partnership signaled that CPAJ’s efforts were not just a local resistance but part of a global struggle for justice. In 1975, the WCC convened an emergency meeting in Geneva on the Korean crisis. At this meeting, the Korean Christian Fellowship for Democracy was established, with Rev. Kim Jae-jun elected as chair. This organization became a vital bridge between CPAJ, progressive Protestant forces, and the international ecumenical movement, allowing CPAJ to consistently share its work on the global stage.\n\nIn 1984, the WCC held a conference in Dozan-so, Japan, focused on the theme of Korean reunification, framing Korean democratization as a matter of theological and moral concern. CPAJ’s actions were interpreted there not merely as political protest but as acts of faithful solidarity with the oppressed, and the WCC incorporated them into its expanded theology of structural human rights. At the time, WCC's theological core had shifted from a focus on individual religious freedom to one of liberationist response to structural violence and oppression. When CPAJ denounced the National Security Law, labor oppression, and division through prayer and Mass, the WCC recognized these as part of “the liberating testimony of global Christianity” and disseminated them across denominational lines.\n\nIn 1987, amid the June Democratic Uprising, the WCC responded to requests from CPAJ and the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) by helping submit human rights violation reports to the United Nations Human Rights Commission European and North American Catholic communities translated and distributed CPAJ’s statements, praising Korea as a place where “a praying church became a resisting church.”\n\nAfter the controversial visit to Pyongyang by Father Moon Kyu-hyun in 1989, CPAJ was formally distanced by the Catholic hierarchy. The bishops issued a public statement saying, “The Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice is not an officially recognized organization,” thereby cutting official ties. Following this, CPAJ operated more independently, forging alliances not within institutional religion, but with civil society, ecumenical circles, and international networks.\n\nThe work of CPAJ in the 1980s was a testament to the history of conscience-driven faith clashing with state power. To “pray” meant to resist dictatorship, and to “fast” meant to share in the suffering of the oppressed. Their actions proved that faith, when practiced ethically, could illuminate the path to justice in dark times.\n\n\nUrban Industrial Mission (UIM)\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) in South Korea evolved beyond simple worker evangelism into a faith-based movement that directly confronted the country’s structural contradictions. Centered around the interdenominational organization known as the Korean Christian Social Mission Council (SASEON), UIM developed a comprehensive and organized structure that engaged deeply with labor, peasant, urban poor, environmental, and democratization movements. The cases of the Yeongdeungpo UIM, SASEON, and the Busan branch of the Korea Pollution Research Institute (KPRI) are especially illustrative of how Christian activism during this period became intertwined with Korea’s wider social and political transformation.\n\nUIM’s activities were first and foremost grounded in the labor field. The Yeongdeungpo UIM worked directly with female factory workers in the Guro Industrial Complex, embodying the conviction that “a labor union is a church for workers.” Rather than emphasizing institutional churches, UIM built community through daily life and solidarity on the factory floor. It organized savings cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and housing collectives, integrating spiritual commitment with survival. One participant recalled, “When I took charge of the credit union, I witnessed the kingdom of God realized on the labor front through the devotional life of the pastors and missionaries.”\n\nThis movement became more organized with the establishment of SASEON in 1976. As an ecumenical collaboration between Protestants and Catholics, SASEON initiated cooperative social missions alongside laborers, farmers, the urban poor, and students—an unprecedented form of interdenominational Christian practice in Korean church history. SASEON declared that “the realization of the Kingdom of God begins not within church walls, but in places of suffering,” and it transcended theological and denominational boundaries. Services utilized a jointly translated Bible, alternated between the Protestant “Hananim” and the Catholic “Haneunim” for “God,” and replaced Eucharist with symbolic shared meals. “It wasn’t doctrinal unity, but the shared tears and laughter that built our church,” one member reflected.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, this movement expanded into environmental issues. The Korea Pollution Research Institute (KPRI), especially its Busan branch, emerged as a key actor. From its founding in 1984, the Busan branch declared that “pollution is not merely an environmental issue but a social evil rooted in the structural contradictions of our society and our nation,” and emphasized solidarity with broader human rights and labor movements. Though nominally subordinate to the Seoul headquarters, the Busan branch operated with substantial autonomy.\n\nThe turning point came with the Onsan disease crisis, which propelled the Busan branch into full-scale anti-pollution activism. In 1985, the branch began publishing the monthly newsletter Pollution and Society, and conducted public education and advocacy efforts across affected areas, including around the Kori nuclear plant and polluted industrial zones like Jangnim and Sasang. It declared that pollution must be approached not just as a public health issue, but as a matter of “life, justice, and peace,” and that “pollution eradication is a movement for life and a movement for peace.”\n\nThe Busan branch also played a major role in founding the Busan Democratic Citizens’ Council (Buminhyup) in 1985. While formally distinct, the two organizations were functionally intertwined. As activist Kang Mi-kyung recalled, “There was no real distinction between Gongmunyeon and Buminhyup—it just became Buminhyup. Even I just drifted from one to the other.” Buminhyup focused on democratization while the KPRI focused on environmental issues, yet both shared personnel, goals, and organizational infrastructure.\n\nIn 1989, the Busan branch transitioned into the Citizens’ Coalition for Pollution Eradication (Gongchu-hyup), in line with shifting societal concerns. This new organization addressed pressing issues like nuclear power risks, water pollution, and industrial waste, while promoting “pollution eradication and anti-nuclear activism as the foundation for democracy and national peace.” Gongchu-hyup would later become the Busan Federation for Environmental Movements (KFEM Busan) in 1993, continuing the legacy of Christian-driven civic and environmental action.\n\nThe work of UIM, SASEON, and the Busan KPRI was not merely a Christian social outreach, but a core component of Korea’s democratization movement. These were not isolated acts of charity, but conscious efforts to find the Kingdom of God in the lives of the oppressed, to reimagine theology through solidarity, and to transform faith into public justice. And while the names have changed, the spirit of these movements—rooted in democracy, life, and justice—continues in new forms today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Council of Korea (CCK)\n\n\nBy the late 1980s, the South Korean Protestant community was sharply divided over issues surrounding unification and anti-communist ideology. In 1988, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued a declaration titled \"A Declaration of the Korean Christian Churches on National Reunification and Peace,\" commonly known as the 88 Declaration. In it, the NCCK confessed and repented that the South Korean church had long regarded anti-communist ideology as a religious tenet and had cursed the North Korean regime and its people. It called instead for peaceful reunification. This declaration caused considerable reverberations both within and outside the Korean church, but it also provoked strong backlash, especially from the broader Protestant community, which at the time leaned heavily conservative. In particular, senior pastors who had fled from North Korea—such as Han Kyung-jik, the elder statesman of Youngnak Church—felt a deep sense of crisis in response to the declaration.\n\nIn January 1989, Han Kyung-jik convened conservative religious elders at the Namhansanseong Retreat Center, where he had retired, and they resolved to establish a new Protestant federation to replace the NCCK. After a series of preparatory meetings and the formation of an organizing committee, the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) was formally launched on December 28, 1989. Although the CCK outwardly advocated church unity and the defense of the gospel, it was fundamentally a conservative reaction to the NCCK's progressive theological and political orientations, particularly its overtures to North Korea. The CCK was also committed to preserving anti-communist ideology.\n\nAllegations have long persisted that the political establishment—particularly the military regime of the time—was involved in the CCK's founding. Han Myung-soo, the first secretary general of the CCK, later testified in an interview that while he initially dismissed the rumors that the Chun Doo-hwan regime had orchestrated the formation of the CCK to counter the NCCK, he came to believe they were true while serving in office. He cited evidence such as the fact that conservative elders like Han Kyung-jik had supported the military regime and that officials from the Ministry of Culture and Public Information's religious affairs office frequently summoned the first CCK chairman, Park Maeng-soo, to give directives. Pastor Oh Choong-il, a member of the National Intelligence Service’s Truth and Reconciliation Committee, also stated during a 2005 forum that an NIS religious affairs officer had been involved in the CCK’s formation. These accounts strongly suggest that the CCK was supported—if not actively created—by the state to serve as a conduit for politicizing the conservative Protestant bloc.\n\nThe CCK began its activities with slogans such as \"defending biblical evangelical faith,\" \"church unity and cooperation,\" and \"fulfilling the church’s social responsibility.\" From the outset, it served as a federation of conservative denominations—including Presbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Pentecostal churches—and took the lead in developing a united evangelical front. The CCK emphasized the church's role in times of national crisis and promoted moral and ethical recovery in Korean society. In doing so, it functioned as a mouthpiece for the conservative church bloc, minimizing internal theological disputes while providing a common voice on major national issues.\n\nAt the time of its founding, the CCK was composed of 36 denominations. This number steadily increased throughout the 1990s and reached 66 by around 2011, encompassing the vast majority of Korean Protestant denominations. Although it lacked the long institutional history of the NCCK, which was founded in 1924, the CCK soon surpassed the NCCK in terms of membership size and political reach. It emerged as the de facto representative body of Korean Protestantism, often consulted by the political establishment and mainstream media as the voice of the Protestant church.\n\nThe CCK took clear political stances throughout the 1990s, especially around themes of anti-communism and moral conservatism. In the 1992 presidential election, it openly supported candidate Kim Young-sam, who was also an elder in the Presbyterian Church. This overt endorsement of a political candidate provoked criticism and raised concerns about the church’s involvement in electoral politics. Nonetheless, the CCK leadership defended its actions as a defense of freedom and democracy, and a stance against communism. After Kim Young-sam assumed office in 1993, the CCK maintained close ties with the ruling party and continued to advocate for the National Security Law, North Korean human rights issues, and national security awareness. As a result, the CCK became an increasingly influential actor in national politics, and in return, the government used it as a channel to communicate with and rally conservative Christian voters.\n\nDuring this period, the CCK also prioritized church ethics and the fight against heresy. Its internal Heresy and Cults Countermeasures Committee worked in cooperation with major denominations to identify and denounce religious groups deemed heretical. The CCK’s actions in this regard were seen as an attempt to protect doctrinal purity and the public image of Korean Christianity, especially following scandals such as the failed prediction of the rapture by the Dami Mission in 1992. Although these activities were praised by some as necessary safeguards, they also generated criticism about excessive heresy labeling and interdenominational conflicts.\n\nElder statesmen like Han Kyung-jik and denominational leaders such as Park Maeng-soo played a crucial role in founding and leading the CCK. Over the decade, CCK leadership included rotating representatives from major denominations: Jeong Jin-kyung and Lee Sung-taek from the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong), Im Ok from the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap), and Ji Deok from the Baptist Church. By the late 1990s, senior pastors from megachurches began to assume greater influence, such as Lee Man-shin from the Holiness Church and Kil Ja-yeon from the Presbyterian Church in Korea, both of whom later served as CCK presidents. These leaders brought their denominational weight and public recognition to elevate the CCK’s status. Alongside these formal leaders, prominent evangelical pastors such as Kim Jun-gon (Korea Campus Crusade for Christ), Kim Hong-do (Kumnan Church), Cho Yong-gi (Yoido Full Gospel Church), and Kim Jang-hwan (Baptist Church) contributed significantly, if informally, to shaping the CCK’s direction. These figures supported the CCK’s initiatives with revival meetings and public sermons that emphasized anti-communism and conservative theology, further consolidating the evangelical base.\n\nThe rise of the CCK also formalized the divide between conservative and progressive camps within Korean Protestantism. Whereas the NCCK pursued ecumenical cooperation, dialogue with North Korea, and social justice advocacy, the CCK refused to join global ecumenical bodies like the WCC or the CCA and instead built its own network of conservative churches. The CCK sharply criticized any outreach to the North as ideological betrayal and rejected progressive theological trends. This antagonism exacerbated the polarization within the Korean church.\n\nExternally, the CCK faced criticism from civic groups and other religious communities. Its electoral intervention in 1992 was condemned as a violation of church-state separation. Civil society organizations accused it of being a patriarchal, political interest group, and media coverage increasingly highlighted its ties to right-wing politics. In response, the CCK held national prayer breakfasts and revival meetings, emphasizing spiritual awakening and national repentance to legitimize its public role.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the CCK deepened its relationship with conservative political forces. Under President Kim Young-sam, its leaders were invited to advisory committees and national ceremonies. After the 1997 financial crisis, the election of President Kim Dae-jung brought a shift in state ideology. The CCK reacted cautiously to Kim’s Sunshine Policy, with some members labeling it pro-North. Nevertheless, the organization refrained from direct confrontation, maintaining a watchful stance while quietly voicing concern.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the CCK had become a key platform for the political mobilization of conservative Christians. Its leaders began to form links with far-right civic organizations, preparing counteractions to anticipated left-leaning governments. This laid the groundwork for the so-called Christian Right in the 2000s, which became active in opposing homosexuality, supporting pro-U.S. policies, and staging nationalist rallies. These developments show that while the CCK maintained institutional decorum during the 1990s, it was already consolidating its political identity.\n\nIn sum, the CCK’s status in 1990s Korean society was complex. On one hand, it provided unity for conservative Protestant churches and amplified their collective voice. It helped congregants preserve a coherent religious identity in a time of rapid political transition. However, the CCK also aligned closely with power, abandoned its prophetic role, and became embroiled in scandals and factional disputes. Cases of corruption and power struggles—especially over presidential elections within the CCK itself—eventually eroded its moral legitimacy. Major denominations began to withdraw, and its representational authority in the church community diminished. Still, the historical significance of the CCK in the 1990s cannot be denied. It mobilized the evangelical right and demonstrated both the strength and limits of religious political engagement. Its experience offers a critical case study in the fusion of religion and politics under the banner of anti-communism in modern Korea.\n\n\nNational Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)\n\n\nAfter the democratization of 1987, South Korea entered a transitional period in which military dictatorship came to an end and civil society began to expand autonomously. In this new context, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), which had long fought for human rights and democratization, ironically began to experience a loss of public influence. Civil society no longer needed the church as a protective platform, and Protestant organizations like the NCCK, which had once incubated the democratic movement, found themselves gradually marginalized by new professional, secular movements with their own resources and networks.\n\nInternally, the absence of a common external enemy such as authoritarian rule weakened moral cohesion within the ecumenical movement. Conservative and progressive denominations, which had previously cooperated under tacit agreements, began to clash over direction, leadership appointments, and theological visions. Amid this shifting environment, the 1988 Declaration—officially titled The Korean Church’s Declaration on National Reunification and Peace—became both a milestone and a turning point.\n\nThe declaration affirmed five principles for peaceful reunification by expanding the 1972 July 4th North-South Joint Statement’s framework of autonomy, peace, and national unity to include humanitarianism and democratization of the reunification process. It also emphasized the need to sign a peace treaty to replace the armistice, demanded the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea, and called for nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula. This declaration, two years in the making, reflected a comprehensive theological and political agenda grounded in national repentance, human dignity, and peace theology. However, the declaration sparked fierce backlash. Conservative Protestant groups, including the Korean Evangelical Fellowship, Presbyterian elders' associations, and interdenominational lay organizations, condemned the NCCK for issuing a statement that \"threatened national security\" and was \"tantamount to communist collaboration\". \n\nParticular controversy arose over the declaration’s proposals for U.S. troop withdrawal and its affirmation of \"people-centered reunification,\" which many interpreted as aligned with leftist ideology. Even within the NCCK’s own member denominations, such as the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK, Tonghap), dissenting voices questioned the declaration’s legitimacy. This tension culminated in the 1989 formation of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK), a conservative ecumenical federation created in direct opposition to the NCCK’s progressive positions. From its inception, the CCK exceeded the NCCK in size and influence, securing strong financial support from megachurches and cultivating close ties with political elites, especially under the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations. During these years, the NCCK was sidelined from national religious leader meetings, government functions, and state consultations, while the CCK was treated as the legitimate Protestant representative.\n\nWithin the NCCK, conflicts over leadership selection, denominational representation, and funding only deepened the crisis. The loss of financial support from the World Council of Churches (WCC) forced the NCCK to adopt a more conservative tone to appeal to domestic backers. Attempts to expand lay leadership, partner with regional churches, or create new movements failed to materialize. Meanwhile, the NCCK lost its symbolic status as a safe haven for whistleblowers and protestors, a role it once held during the dictatorship era. Despite these internal and external challenges, the 1988 Declaration remains a landmark in the history of Korean Christianity. It represented the first time that a major Protestant body offered a theologically grounded, politically engaged roadmap for peaceful reunification. Though polarizing, the declaration laid the groundwork for subsequent events such as Rev. Moon Ik-hwan’s and Lim Su-kyung’s visits to North Korea and reenergized discussions within the WCC and global Christian networks on Korean peace issues.\n\nIn short, the 1990s were a period of paradox for the NCCK. On one hand, it suffered from organizational decline, public marginalization, and internal disputes. On the other, it produced a morally ambitious vision that attempted to reorient Korean Protestantism toward justice, repentance, and peacebuilding. This era ultimately forced the NCCK to reexamine its identity and mission within a democratized, pluralistic society.\n\n\nChristian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development (CISJD)\n\n\nThe Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development (hereafter CISJD), established in 1979 based on ecumenical principles, pursued the vision of building a \"just and democratic society\" and a \"community of coexistence.\" During the 1990s, Korean churches continued to wrestle with major issues such as democratization, social justice, and reunification. In this context, CISJD played a prominent role, particularly in the fields of labor, human rights, church reform, and reunification. For example, a 1988 report published by CISJD titled The Presidential Election Struggle: The Logic and Practice of the People’s Democratic Movement revealed the organization's strong support for democratization and labor movements. This shows that CISJD aligned itself with the struggles of workers and the oppressed and was committed to expanding their rights in society. At the time, issues such as securing the right to organize, opposing privatization, and protecting freedom of expression were central, and CISJD actively responded to these concerns both inside and outside the church.\n\nCISJD supported labor rights throughout the 1990s. It maintained solidarity with newly emerging labor unions after democratization, advocating for the elimination of irregular labor and the freedom to organize. The organization's focus on the rights of the working poor and the promotion of democracy within the workplace highlights its commitment to Christian social ethics. Though detailed media coverage from the time is limited, the institute’s position was clearly aligned with broader progressive Christian engagement in labor issues.\n\nThe 1990s marked a period of expanding civil liberties in Korea. CISJD, whose founding vision was rooted in justice and democracy, was naturally active in supporting causes such as freedom of conscience and freedom of speech. In particular, the organization sided with the progressive factions within the Korean church that supported liberation theology and criticized lingering authoritarianism. While specific declarations from the 1990s are scarce, it is evident that CISJD advocated for civic engagement and human dignity in both public and church discourse.\n\nOne of the institute’s core commitments was church reform. As the Korean church grew in size and wealth, problems of corruption, materialism, and clerical authoritarianism became more prominent. In response, CISJD called for a return to “anti-mammonist faith” and emphasized the mission of the church in terms of service and public responsibility. It promoted internal democratization of church structures, the inclusion of young people and women in leadership, and critical reflection on theology and ecclesiology. These reformist impulses continued into the 21st century—for example, CISJD hosted academic forums on topics such as “Korean Churches and the Youth.”\n\nCISJD also played a part in peace and reunification movements. From its inception, the institute had emphasized peaceful coexistence and dialogue, and in the 1990s it supported inter-Korean exchange and nuclear disarmament. In later years, it published policy reports such as “How to Resume the Peace Process on the Korean Peninsula.”¹ This continuing interest reflects the Korean church’s long-standing concern with peacemaking and overcoming Cold War divisions. The institute also collaborated with NGOs working on reunification and humanitarian aid to North Korea.\n\nBeyond these thematic areas, CISJD engaged in wide-ranging solidarity work on issues such as women’s rights, the environment, and the urban poor. Notably, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (Korean Council, formerly) used part of CISJD’s office in Seoul in the late 1990s, showing the institute’s support for feminist and anti-colonial advocacy.\n\nThese activities were highly significant within the context of the 1990s Korean church. While conservative, charismatic, and prosperity-driven churches gained momentum, progressive Protestant voices like CISJD provided a critical counterbalance. The institute played a bridge role between church and society, advocating justice-based theology rooted in minjung and liberation theology. It helped sustain a prophetic tradition within Korean Christianity by encouraging public engagement, theological reflection, and ethical responsibility.\n\n\nChristian Ethics Movement for Practice (CEM)\n\n\nThe Christian Ethics Movement for Practice (CEM) was founded in 1987, during a transitional moment in South Korea’s democratization, when society was seeking a new moral compass and ethical framework. Throughout the 1990s, the organization carried out a broad range of reform initiatives grounded in evangelical faith, addressing not only personal piety but also contributing structurally to the improvement of ethical consciousness and civic responsibility in Korean society.\n\nCEM’s emergence coincided with the democratizing energy following the June 1987 Uprising and the July–August labor movement. At a time when the radical theology of the minjung movement and the institutional church both struggled to adapt, CEM provided a third way—a model of “social reform through personal ethical renewal.” \n\nAs a Christian civic organization, it extended evangelical ethics into the public sphere and chose institutional reform and lifestyle-based movements over political radicalism. One of the most significant actions during the 1990s was the Clean Elections Movement. In the 1991 local elections, CEM organized the “Christian Committee for Clean Elections” to resist electoral corruption and pastoral interference in politics. This initiative promoted a set of ethical criteria for political engagement, working in collaboration with groups such as the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice (CCEJ) and the YMCA. Its impact continued through subsequent elections in 2000 and 2004, contributing to broader coalitions like the “Civic Movement Council for Clean Elections”. Another major effort was the Healthy Church Movement, which targeted internal corruption within churches, especially the practice of hereditary pastoral succession. In the late 1990s, CEM issued public statements opposing this custom and petitioned denominations for reform. Although this created tensions with some conservative denominations, it played a pivotal role in embedding the logic of self-regulation within Korean Protestantism. CEM also spearheaded the Cultural Consumer Movement, aimed at reforming unethical media content. It launched the “Right Media Reading Campaign” to criticize sensationalism in sports tabloids and promote media ethics. By organizing petitions and advertising boycotts, it applied civic pressure that led to concrete changes in broadcasting regulations. However, its activism sparked both alliances with certain public agencies and conflict with liberal civic groups who saw it as moralistic or censorious.\n\nThese campaigns were underpinned by a theological commitment to evangelical public witness. Professor Son Bong-ho, a founding leader, argued that “if Christians fail to set a moral example, they have no authority to criticize social corruption.” He emphasized the necessity of personal integrity as the basis for credible public ethics. CEM's intellectual foundation rested on evangelical covenantal ethics, shaped in part by the Lausanne Covenant, which asserted that “we must participate in God’s concern to liberate people from every kind of oppression”.\n\nCEM established a distinct voice within Korean society, achieving moral authority across both religious and secular spaces. It collaborated with civic organizations like YMCA, CCEJ, and media watchdogs, while maintaining critical distance from more radical groups. Especially in economic justice campaigns, it rejected class-based narratives, advocating instead for moral responsibility and incremental reform. This exposed it to criticisms from both progressive and conservative quarters—seen by some as “limited moralism” and by others as “unnecessary political engagement”. Nevertheless, CEM made a lasting impact in four key areas: (1) initiating ethical reform within Protestant churches, (2) modeling evangelical civic engagement, (3) reviving ethical discourse across multiple sectors, and (4) serving as a bridge between faith communities and secular civil society. In this way, CEM opened a new path for evangelical Christianity in post-democratization Korea. Without resorting to militant politics or ideological dogmatism, it demonstrated the possibility of “critical distance and constructive reform” through ethical practices rooted in faith.\n\n\nKorea Association for Creation Research (KACR)\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) actively expanded its organizational structure and public outreach. Originally founded in 1981 by Dr. Kim Young-gil of KAIST, the association was officially incorporated as a legal non-profit organization in November 1990 by the Ministry of Education, laying a firm institutional foundation for its work. Regional branches steadily increased; starting with Daejeon and Daegu in 1981, the organization had more than 10 branches nationwide by the late 1990s.\n\nThe KACR held annual lectures and symposiums on creation science. In celebration of its 10th anniversary, the association hosted a large-scale international symposium at Onnuri Church in August 1991, featuring six speakers from countries including the U.S., Australia, and Japan, and drawing approximately 4,000 attendees.Another international symposium followed in 1993, held during the Daejeon Expo, with five Korean and six foreign scientists participating. In addition to such major events, the association organized smaller public debates and seminars across churches and universities. The KACR also developed a variety of publications, including the periodical Creation and textbooks aligned with its scientific creationist perspective. In 1990, the association published Natural Science, a university-level science textbook written by 27 members, attracting attention from both church and academic communities. Other publications included introductory books such as What You Didn’t Know About Creation Science, as well as evangelistic pamphlets and visual materials.\n\nIn 1993, the KACR opened a creation science exhibition hall during the Daejeon Expo. The hall, comprising seven themed sections—such as Genesis creation, Noah’s Flood, geology, and fossils—attracted around 60,000 visitors during the Expo’s three-month run. The association also developed university courses at Christian institutions like Myongji University and Handong Global University, and in 1995, launched the “Creation Science Supporters Fellowship,” composed of pastors and laypeople who actively supported church-based creation science education. Despite these initiatives, attempts to integrate creationist content into public school science curricula met resistance. Efforts to include creationism in textbooks failed, and the KACR even pursued constitutional litigation challenging the exclusion.\n\nThe KACR is rooted in the evangelical and fundamentalist Christian tradition. Interest in creation science intensified after the 1980 World Evangelization Crusade held in Seoul, where a seminar titled “Creation or Evolution?” featured American speakers like Henry Morris and Duane Gish. This event sparked momentum for the association’s official launch the following year. Theologically, the KACR adhered to biblical inerrancy and a literal interpretation of Genesis, including young-earth creationism. It sought to present creationism in the guise of scientific inquiry, collaborating with fundamentalist institutions like the U.S.-based Institute for Creation Research (ICR). Churches from both conservative and some moderate Protestant denominations provided financial support. In 1994, Pastor Hong Nam-yi of Daejeon’s Chanyang Church and other clergy formed a creation science pastoral support group, which developed into a larger fellowship the following year. This movement was widely seen in the Christian community as a defense of biblical worldview and a faith-based educational ministry.\n\nThe KACR’s efforts to challenge evolutionary theory sparked significant tension in academic and educational circles. Mainstream scientists regarded creation science as lacking empirical rigor. In 1982, at a symposium organized by the Inha University Natural Science Research Institute, only evolutionist scholars presented because the creationist speakers declined the invitation. Philosophers of science like Jang Dae-ik and Ko Myung-jin classified creation science as “pseudoscience” due to its lack of falsifiability.\n\nEducation policy also became a battleground. The KACR opposed the exclusive teaching of evolution in secondary school textbooks and asserted that doing so violated religious freedom. They even prepared a constitutional appeal. This tension continued into the 2000s as curriculum review guidelines became a subject of dispute. While some churches pushed for curriculum changes, science educators and teachers' groups criticized the KACR’s efforts as unscientific and ideologically driven. In 1991, the science magazine Science Dong-A featured a three-part dialogue between creationist and evolutionist scholars, underscoring the controversy’s depth.\n\nThe KACR's work occupied a contentious space between Christian and scientific communities. Coverage by mainstream media varied: conservative outlets like Kukmin Ilbo reported on the constitutional appeal from a sympathetic angle, while progressive outlets like Hankyoreh or Kyunghyang Shinmun tended to be critical. Hankyoreh Science Webzine published retrospective essays comparing the creation-evolution debate in Korea to the 1925 Scopes “Monkey” Trial in the United States. Christian media and broadcasters portrayed the KACR more favorably, highlighting its conferences, publications, and exhibits as efforts to demonstrate the compatibility of faith and science. Public outreach was relatively effective: the 1993 Expo exhibit drew tens of thousands, and creation science lectures became a common feature of youth ministries in larger churches.\n\nAssessments of the creation science movement vary widely. Supporters view the KACR’s work as a vital campaign to defend religious freedom and biblical worldview. The association argued that exclusive teaching of evolution infringed upon believers' rights and religious pluralism. Parents and pastors praised its potential to provide Christian youth with a faith-compatible view of science. Socially, it raised broader questions about religious freedom, scientific authority, and educational diversity. Critics, however, argued that creation science lacked scientific rigor and undermined quality science education. Professor Kim Woo-jae was sued for defamation by the KACR after labeling the group as “pseudoscientific,” but the charges were dismissed. Philosophers like Jang Dae-ik applied the standards of Popperian falsifiability and Kuhnian paradigms to argue that creation science was unscientific by definition. They warned that the movement promoted anti-intellectualism and could erode the integrity of science education.\n\nIn sum, the Korea Association for Creation Research played a pivotal role in introducing the creation-evolution debate to Korean society in the 1990s. The movement mobilized the conservative Christian base to engage in education and science discourse while sparking societal reflection on the boundaries between science and religion. From a neutral perspective, the KACR significantly influenced faith-based education in Korea but remained deeply controversial in terms of scientific legitimacy.\n\n\nKorean Student Christian Federation (KSCF)\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF) sought to overcome internal fragmentation and respond to a rapidly changing social landscape by reorienting itself as a democratic, grassroots movement. This decade marked a turning point as KSCF attempted to recover from the ideological conflicts and organizational crises that had plagued it since the 1980s.\n\nOne of the most significant crises emerged in 1989 during the appointment of a new general secretary, which revealed deep internal divisions. This incident, though initially seen as a personnel issue, reflected broader, long-standing tensions over the relationship between “faith and politics” and “gospel and society.” As one source notes, “the appointment controversy dealt a critical blow to the credibility of the organization, exhausting its moral and activist energy, and leading to distrust among students”. This triggered a serious internal reckoning about KSCF’s democratic structure and mission. In response, the 1991 General Assembly declared a plan of “reunification,” outlining strategic priorities such as the consolidation of ideological direction, the reinforcement of local chapters, and the democratization of organizational processes. These measures signaled a transition from a narrowly focused movement to a broader people-centered activism. The federation also worked to restore relationships with denominational churches and expand its national support base.\n\nAmong KSCF’s flagship initiatives in the 1990s was the “Suffering and Resurrection Campaign,” which built on the legacy of earlier movements like the April Revolution commemorations of the 1970s and 1980s. In this framework, KSCF aligned itself with contemporary struggles for justice. In 1993, students organized a nationwide fundraising campaign for former “comfort women”; in 1994, they mobilized around the issues of prisoner amnesty and the abolition of the National Security Law; and in 1995, they led campus-wide solidarity campaigns with foreign laborers.\n\nRural mission work was also restructured in light of new realities. Student groups no longer relied on top-down programs but instead designed context-sensitive summer ministries through grassroots planning. These efforts emphasized community-based faith practices that embodied social solidarity. Additionally, KSCF did not limit its work to activism but fostered theological reflection and research. Through publications such as Bible and Praxis, the federation explored a biblically grounded theology of liberation and promoted socially engaged Christian thought. This was part of an effort “to root the student movement not only in activism but in a theological tradition responsive to Korean society’s ethical and spiritual crises”.\n\nIn sum, the 1990s were a decade of redefinition for the KSCF. Despite internal and external challenges, it remained a space where faith intersected with democracy, justice, and intellectual inquiry. Its trajectory during this time demonstrated how Christian student movements could serve as laboratories for integrating gospel witness with public ethics in a transforming Korean society.\n\n\nYWCA\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the Korean YWCA entered a significant period of transition marked by institutional expansion and a deepening reflection on its identity as a Christian women's movement. Following decades of cautious engagement during authoritarian rule, the organization began to ask itself fundamental questions about its social mission—“What is the YWCA and what should it become?”—as it responded to the democratization and decentralization movements unfolding across South Korea. This decade witnessed a strategic tension between institutionalization and prophetic action, as the YWCA assumed new roles in public service delivery while also trying to remain faithful to its mission of Christian-inspired social justice and women’s empowerment.\n\nOne major development during this time was the YWCA’s growing participation in the state-led privatization of welfare services. Beginning in the early 1990s, local YWCA branches across the country received contracts from the government to operate child care centers, women’s job training institutes, counseling services, and shelters. By 1995, the number of local YWCA social workers had grown from 93 in 1981 to nearly 1,500, signaling a rapid quantitative expansion. However, this growth also raised internal concerns. The shift toward welfare provision risked diffusing the YWCA's core movement identity, as staff became increasingly absorbed in facility management rather than grassroots advocacy.\n\nThis institutional turn was not merely bureaucratic; it was also animated by regional innovation and experimentation. In Gwangju, the YWCA served as a vital hub of social resistance and citizen education well into the 1990s. Programs such as the Citizen Forums, Thursday Prayer Meetings, and the People’s Forum (Minjung Nondan) brought together leading theologians, dissident intellectuals, and church-based activists. Figures such as Moon Ik-hwan, Han Wan-sang, and Suh Nam-dong delivered public lectures at Gwangju YWCA, directly challenging the legacy of military rule and cultivating a new public ethos of peace, human rights, and social participation. In addition, the YWCA hosted alternative education initiatives like Winter College, where dismissed professors from the “Education Guidelines Incident” (1990) gave lectures to students and citizens alike. These programs positioned Gwangju YWCA as a “public salon” and spiritual base for democratic civic culture in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Daegu YWCA maintained a sustained focus on social service and civic education, even within the constraints of a politically conservative region. Throughout the 1990s, Daegu YWCA emphasized gendered community care and women’s empowerment through programs aimed at job training, youth education, and environmental activism. Interviews with local activists reveal that many were inspired by their earlier involvement in student and democratization movements, and they carried this vision into their YWCA work. Although the YWCA in Daegu did not pursue overt political activism like some other civic groups, it cultivated social change through what might be termed a “quiet pedagogy of citizenship,” rooted in Christian values and persistent local engagement.\n\nA key sector of transformation for YWCA in this period was care work, as the organization restructured its employment support programs in response to shifts in labor and welfare policy. Originally operating under a free job referral model, YWCA began transitioning to social enterprises, cooperatives, and fee-based placement services to secure sustainability. The YWCA resisted the market logic that dominated care services, instead proposing an alternative model grounded in communal responsibility, women's rights, and the public good. This approach was dubbed the “Care Justice Movement,” and aimed not only at delivering quality services but also at reforming social perceptions of domestic labor and improving working conditions for female care workers.\n\nYWCA’s care-related projects were characterized by several distinctive features. First, they were rooted in a member-based community ethos, allowing for mutual support between the organization and care workers. Second, the organization had a rich history of training and credentialing, ensuring professionalism. Third, its Christian and feminist mission gave workers a sense of pride and ethical responsibility. Fourth, it maintained a strong national-local network capable of responding to diverse needs. Finally, its longstanding partnership—sometimes critical—with government agencies enabled it to shape welfare policy while retaining its independent moral vision.\n\nIn sum, the 1990s Korean YWCA embodied a multifaceted identity: a care service provider, a Christian reform movement, and a civic educator. While it expanded into the formal welfare apparatus, it also maintained a critical and creative presence in local communities. By integrating faith, gender justice, and public service, YWCA redefined what a women’s organization could look like in post-authoritarian South Korea—neither narrowly religious nor simply secular, neither merely charitable nor overtly confrontational. Rather, it stood as a mediating space where ordinary women could participate in the remaking of Korean civil society.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristianity in Manchuria was both young and highly centralized, meaning that for most of its early history, the church was synonymous with Catholic and Protestant missions. Of these, the former was more tightly organized under a foreign mission presence, while the later   emphasized initiative by native converts, aka indigenization. \n\n\nCatholic mission:\n\nCatholic mission during the period of initial Jesuit encounter during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had made some impact on a handful of scattered villages, but apart from extremely infrequent contact with missionaries in Mongolia, these early communities spent the next few centuries largely cut off from the Church. Later missionaries would occasionally mention visiting a village with a long since dissipated Christian presence, with only the physical remains of a cross as testament.\n\n\nThe resurgence of formal Catholic mission presence in Manchuria only occurred in 1838, when the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong (Liaodong) was established out of the larger territory of the Diocese of Beijing, which at the time included most of China. This large territory was placed in the charge of the Société des Missions Etrangères, commencing with its inaugural head, Bishop Emmanuel Verrolles. (The MEP is/was founded in 1658 as a specialist in Asian mission. It was active throughout East Asia, particularly in areas of French interest.) Two years later, the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong was changed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong and Manchuria, representing the loss of the northwestern areas of Gansu (later renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Shanxi) and the formation of a new mission under the Belgian Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Scheutist) in Mongolia.\n\n\nManchuria would remain under this Vicariate Apostolic until 1898, when in response to the growth of the Church and the unwieldy size of the territory it covered, the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong and Manchuria was divided into the Apostolic Vicariates of southern and northern Manchuria, centered in Mukden and Jilin, respectively. This division came at the recommendation of Bishop Laurent Guillon, who remained the head of the Mukden Apostolic Vicariate until his death in 1900. In 1898, there were an estimated 25,000 Catholics in the entire territory of Manchuria, of which 17,433 were in Southern Manchuria.\n\n\nGrowth of Catholic population (all of Manchuria)\n\n\n1885: 12,618\n\n1887: 13,025\n\n1888: 13,126\n\n1889: 13,943\n\n1890: 14,220\n\n1892: 15,075\n\n1893: 15,825\n\n1894: 16,844\n\n1895: 18,061\n\n1896: 19,819\n\n1897: 22,149\n\n1898: 25,000\n\n\nState of Catholic mission\n\n1873: 1 Bishop, 12 European missionaries, 2 indigenous priests, 30 baptizers, 1 community of indigenous nuns: 60 sisters \n\n\n1891: 14.352 baptized Christians divided into 21 Christian districts, 2 seminaries, 42 boys’ schools, 46 girls’ schools, 16 orphanages, 8 indigenous priests and 42 seminary pupils.\n\n\nApart from the formal Church hierarchy, Catholic villages often led a highly independent existence, especially during this early period.  Dispersed through the countryside, Catholic villages were ministered mostly by indigenous priests. The more remote of these would only see a priest on a few occasions throughout the year. \n\n\nProtestant Union\n\nThe earliest Protestant missionary in Manchuria was William C. Burns, who arrived in Niuzhuang in 1867. Although Burns died one year later, his arrival still had the effect of placing Manchuria on the Protestant map, his death serving as a rallying call for later generations of missionaries. Through the 1870s, the Protestant presence in Niuzhuang remained small, consisting of a chapel and dispensary, and one or two missionaries of the Scottish United Presbyterian Mission. Baptisms were relatively few and hostility towards foreigners occasionally broke into violence. In 1885, the Scottish mission and the Irish Presbyterian Mission joined in the Presbytery of Manchuria, often simply referred to as the Union, initiating a period of takeoff. (These missions had already been active in the British Isles. The Irish mission had a foundation in Gujarat. The Scottish mission only worked in China, with their efforts focused on Manchuria.) By 1893, the mission reported a total of 896 baptized Christians. With the 1894 outbreak of war between China and Japan, all missionaries were ordered to leave the interior and seek shelter in the port, a decision which Protestant sources portray as allowing the native church to stand on its own, but by Catholic sources as the Protestant missionaries abandoning their flock. Regardless, the Protestant mission grew rapidly in the subsequent years aided by the influx of new missionaries and the reputational boost provided by the mission’s medical and charitable work, particularly during the period of Sino-Japanese War. Over 2,500 were baptized in 1899 alone, and the total membership of both missions of the Manchurian (Protestant) Church included 19,646 members, as well as 251 churches, chapels and houses of prayer (Boyd 63)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously, the two main organizations in Manchuria were the Catholic and Protestant missions. Of these the Catholic underwent some redistricting during this decade, while the latter welcomed new sources of foreign support and branched out into new social organizations. \n\n\nCatholic missions:\n\n\nTwo events followed soon after the 1898 division of the Manchuria VA into north and south  vicariates (Mudken and Jilin): the decimation of the Boxer violence and the period of growth in the immediate aftermath.  The former included the violent death of Bishop Guillon, VA of Mudken, loss of life and property by thousands of Chinese Christians in both districts, and the destruction of nearly all Church property in Mudken and the as yet far smaller VA of Jilin. The latter was a period of rapid expansion, fueled by funds from the Boxer indemnity and by the disgrace of the anti-foreign faction at court, and the relative silencing of anti-foreign voices more generally across society. Both Catholic and Protestant missions expanded during this decade.\n\n\nPopulation figures (See 1930-1939 file for entire chart) show a decline of about one quarter of the (baptized) Catholic population between 1899 and 1900.\n\n\nProtestant missions:\n\n\nLike the Catholics, the Protestant missions underwent a violent contraction, followed by a period of effusive growth. The latter was likely larger than the rebirth enjoyed by the Catholics, as it was fueled by the “Manchurian Revival” in the late part of the decade. \n\n\nThe Boxer violence was less pronounced for the Protestant missionaries, most of whom sought refuge in the foreign ports or overseas. The number of Christians killed is not given, most likely because the missionaries themselves did not know, especially considering the weak organizational structure of the Protestant Christian community. Nevertheless, there was significant loss of property, including Christie’s small hospital, which was completely destroyed.\n\n\nThe post-Boxer recovery was also a time of institution building. The Protestant missions completed work on the Union Theological College, which had been started in 1900, and on the medical school\n\n\nPolitical allies:\n\n\nThe category of pro-Christian organizations can now include friendly officials within the government. Although missionary sources do not mention specifics, the universal hostility of the pre-Boxer period has shifted such that some local officials (notably in the anti-Christian stronghold of Hulan) are visibly friendly to the missions. Whereas in pre-Boxer sources, local officials are universally hostile, whether due to personal antipathy, fear that the Christians would serve to welcome a coming invasion, or weakness in the face of popular agitation, here they are shown to be more mixed. While there are still anti-foreign officials, including some who   incite violence using former Boxers, there are also some like the magistrate of Hulan, who demonstrate support by welcoming the return of the missionaries in a public setting with the pomp of office.\n\n\n\nThe growing size and complexity of the Manchurian Catholic church prompted a number of divisions during this decade: \n\n\nYanji, the heavily Korean region adjacent to the Korean border along the Yalu River was made a Prefecture Apostolic in 1928. A Prefecture Apostolic is a designation specifically created for evangelization. It precedes the formation of a Vicariate Apostolic, which is erected to nurture a fledgling church. Yanji was given the designation of Vicariate Apostolic in 1938. \n\n\nQiqihar was erected as a “sui iuris” (self-governing, i.e., independent) mission in 1928. This sort of designation is for an area with very few Catholics or one that is under persecution, I suspect that the meaning here was the former, but cannot say precisely why the decision was made to separate the region in this way. By way of context, Outer Mongolia was given the same designation in 1922, so my suspicion is that what was being intended was to protect the small but growing church in Jilin by removing the burden of ministering Qiqihar. Qiqihar would be named a Prefecture Apostolic in 1939.\n\n\nFrom the two VAs of Mukden and Jehol (Rehe), the new VA of Sipingjie (Szepingkai) was created in 1929. Unlike the previous two divisions, which this was the result of the growth of the church in this area. This region would be administered by the Canadian-born Bishop Joseph Lapierre (MEP), who took up his post in 1930.\n\n\nCatholic estimate the entire Christian (certainly to mean Catholic) population of Manchuria at 60 thousand. In 1920, there were four religious communities: Changchun, Harbin, Xiaobajiazi, and Hulan. \n\n\nMissionaries from the Quebec Society of Foreign Missions arrived in 1925. They were followed by priests of the Society of Foreign Missions of America (Maryknoll) in 1929.\n\n\nDuring the 1920s, Korean settlers began arriving overland from Korea into Jilin. The timing of this exodus represented a push factor of land poverty and Japanese repression at home (particularly for Christians following the unrest of 1919), as well as a pull factor of relatively open farmland in Jilin and a market for high-yield flooded field (Japonica) rice, a crop that Koreans knew much better than the local Chinese farmers, and which had a growing demand in Japan.  Sources mention that there were initially very few Catholics among these Korean settlers, and that there were plans to send someone to Korea to find a catechumen to preach the Gospel among them.\n\n\nProtestants\n\nThe Protestant Union remained under its existing structure, both in terms of its constituent mission groups and of its relation to the larger organization (Synod) based in Shanghai. Sources emphasize that the number of Christians was consistently growing, but give no numbers, most likely because they did not themselves have a way of counting a congregation that was intended to grow organically under its own power. The rise of nationalism and desire to increase Chinese ownership over the church prompted the Protestants to lower the profile of their social mission. This trend would accelerate under the Japanese in the subsequent decade. \n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nCatholic\n\nIn 1932, the parish of St. François-Xavier was entrusted to Father Patrouilleau, a missionary from Tokyo. This church was located to the Japanese concession and in the consular district in Mukden and was used by Japanese and Korean Catholics, and Catholic foreigners.\n\n\nUnder the Manchukuo regime, the Manchurian Catholic church was forced to sever relations with the Chinese church and realign themselves to communicate with Catholic authorities in Tokyo instead of those in Beijing. While this did not likely influence personal communication amongst to leaders, it did complicate routine visits and force measures such as the founding of a new Church printing house in 1934, since the church could no longer source its printed materials from Hong Kong or China.\n\n\nBelow are all available statistics for Catholic Church membership in Manchuria. The drop in Mukden VA in 1931 is due to the creation of new districts from what was formerly Mudken territory: Jehol 1929, and Fushun in 1932. These new territories reflect continued growth of Church membership, but create the illusion of a decline between 1927 and 1931. I have not found population data for the two new districts. The same is true for the creation of the sui iuris district of Qiqihar, which was created in 1928 out of the territory of the Jilin VA, creating the same apparent drop in membership. \n\n\n|  | total Catholics | total adult baptisms | Jilin VA Catholics | Jilin VA baptisms | Mukden VA catholics | Mukden VA baptisms |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1866 | 8000 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1873 | 8672 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1880 |  | 341 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1882 |  | 287 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1884 |  | 497 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1885 | 12618 | 351 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1887 | 13025 | 402 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1888 | 13128 | 312 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1889 | 13943 | 988 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1890 | 14220 | 510 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1891 | 14352 | 518 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1892 | 15075 | 535 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1893 | 15825 | 662 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1894 | 16844 | 852 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1895 | 18061 | 1290 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1896 | 19189 | 1529 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1897 | 22149 | 3180 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1898 | 25000 | 4006 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1903 | 27161 | 1748 | 10161 | 1038 | 17000 | 710 |\n| 1904 | 28834 | 3207 | 11562 | 1454 | 17272 | 1753 |\n| 1905 | 30648 | 3016 | 13376 | 1924 | 17272 | 1092 |\n| 1906 | 33737 | 2681 | 14924 | 1718 | 18813 | 963 |\n| 1907 | 37921 | 3212 | 17293 | 2149 | 20628 | 1063 |\n| 1908 | 41481 | 3439 | 19350 | 1709 | 22131 | 1730 |\n| 1909 | 44575 | 3151 | 21167 | 1486 | 23408 | 1665 |\n| 1910 | 47268 | 2472 | 22493 | 946 | 24775 | 1526 |\n| 1911 | 44892 | 2451 | 19028 | 988 | 25864 | 1463 |\n| 1912 | 46624 | 2145 | 20071 | 672 | 26553 | 1473 |\n| 1913 | 48155 | 1830 | 21139 | 650 | 27016 | 1180 |\n| 1914 | 50321 | 2115 | 22406 | 692 | 27915 | 1423 |\n| 1915 | 51158 | 1702 | 23311 | 600 | 27847 | 1102 |\n| 1916 | 53265 | 2976 | 24260 | 645 | 29005 | 2331 |\n| 1917 |  |  |  |  | 30350 | 2780 |\n| 1918 |  |  |  |  | 30428 | 1395 |\n| 1919 | 56708 | 1413 | 26051 | 432 | 30657 | 981 |\n| 1920 | 57212 | 1244 | 26935 | 508 | 30277 | 736 |\n| 1921 | 56415 | 1268 | 27220 | 400 | 29195 | 868 |\n| 1922 | 51276 | 1287 | 22276 | 534 | 29000 | 753 |\n| 1923 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1924 | 52642 | 1221 | 22369 | 581 | 30273 | 640 |\n| 1925 | 64013 | 1047 | 33299 | 612 | 30714 | 435 |\n| 1926 | 54096 | 2761 | 22999 | 2277 | 31097 | 484 |\n| 1927 |  |  |  |  | 31798 | 505 |\n| 1928 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1929 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1930 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1931 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1932 | 48142 | 1275 | 22255 | 560 | 25887 | 715 |\n| 1933 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1934 | 53580 | 2569 | 26797 | 1314 | 26783 | 1255 |\n| 1935 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1936 | 61114 | 3065 | 30619 | 1863 | 30495 | 1202 |\n| 1937 | 61954 | 3097 | 30636 | 1834 | 31318 | 1263 |\n| 1938 | 61147 | 2966 | 31743 | 1988 | 29404 | 978 |\n| 1939 | 62350 | 2438 | 32308 | 1559 | 30042 | 879 |\n\n\nProtestant\n\nThe Protestant churches were forced by Manchukuo authorities to divest any affiliation with the Chinese Church, i.e., the Synod in Shanghai. At the same time, they did remain in communication with and received advice from home boards.  The question of how, and to what degree to acquiesce to Japanese demands, was up to some debate, but on the whole, the decision was made to do as little as possible, while hoping to Weather the storm. Reversing the long-standing policy of seeking to distance themselves from extraterritoriality, it was considered the late 1930s whether to incorporate the missions as a “juridical person,” as per the Japanese demand. Doing so would have allowed the schools to continue to operate, but at the cost of acquiescing to demands for Japanese ideological indoctrination, such as Shinto shrine participation. In 1938, the decision was made simply to leave the educational mission all together. The schools were sold to the Manchukuo government for the sum of 641 thousand Manchurian dollars, which was considered to be a fair price. By 1940, the atmosphere had become untenable, and missionaries were advised to repatriate.\n\n\nAs reported to Synod in 1939, the state of the Protestant church was as follows:\n\n\nChurches: 288 congregations, membership about 30,000, 100 ministers, 250 evangelists.\n\n\nSchools: before official interference with the school system, there were 30 schools, 200 teachers, and over 5000 pupils. \n\n\nHospitals: 14 hospitals, 250 nurses, 50 doctors, including those on the staff of the medical college.\n\n\n\n\nState of the two churches\n\n\nCatholic \n\nIn 1946, Vicariates Apostolic in Mukden and Jilin are elevated to dioceses. More than a nominal change, the change to status of diocese signifies that these districts have shed their tutelary status. These are no longer missionary fields and that they will henceforth be led by bishops. This change took place across China and was the culmination of decades of agitation by native priests for true equality of the Chinese Church in the eyes of the Vatican. \n\nMost foreign priests remained in Manchuria until the Communist takeover, at which point they were placed under house arrest or briefly imprisoned before being repatriated in 1951 or 1952. Chinese leaders of the new Patriotic Church emerged during the early years of the 1950s.\n\n\nProtestant\n\nThe repatriation of missionaries in 1940 and 1941, followed by outbreak of war between Japan and the Allies late that year, left the Protestant church completely defenseless. Schools and hospitals had since been placed under Japanese ownership, and any church service was closely observed by state spies. With the outbreak of war in 1941, any remaining missionaries were placed under house arrest, later, to be transported to Harbin, and finally Japan, from which some were sent home as part of a prisoner exchange. \n\nWith the end of the war, it was clear that the Chinese churches were, in fact, completely independent. A commission that returned late in 1945, found high enthusiasm among Chinese Christians, who had managed to maintain basic educational and medical institutions, even during the Japanese occupation. While a Mukden conference in 1947 did make some preparation to retrain Chinese church leaders, plans were already underway to withdraw mission personnel, and the last missionaries had left by 1950.\n\n\n \n\n### Section: Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\n\nChurch Reconstruction Movement 교회재건운동\n\nIn the aftermath of the Korean War, the church reconstruction movement in 1950s Korea emerged as a comprehensive and multifaceted response to the spiritual, social, and material devastation caused by the conflict. Churches were not only physically destroyed—541 Presbyterian churches, 239 Methodist churches, 106 Holiness churches, and 4 Salvation Army churches were either damaged or completely lost —but thousands of pastors and believers were killed, and the Christian faith itself was tested by ideological betrayal and persecution.\n\nInternational Christian organizations, particularly from the United States, extended large-scale humanitarian aid, including food, clothing, and medical supplies. The Church World Service alone distributed over 23 million pounds of food and nearly a million pounds of clothing by 1959. This support laid the groundwork for rebuilding churches, providing care for war widows, orphans, and the disabled, and reviving the Christian mission in Korea.\n\nWithin the church, the war exposed theological and ethical fault lines. While some Christian leaders compromised with North Korean authorities, others paid with their lives for remaining faithful. This reality led to a period of profound repentance and spiritual renewal. Notable evangelistic gatherings, such as Billy Graham’s rallies in Busan (1952) and Seoul (1956), became pivotal moments for the restoration of the Christian spirit and public witness.\n\nAt the same time, Korean churches pursued aggressive evangelistic efforts. The Presbyterian Church designated 1952 as “the year of evangelism” and implemented a four-stage strategy—personal renewal, personal evangelism, cooperative outreach, and church-based campaigns. This resulted in the establishment of over 2,050 new churches by 1955 across denominations including Presbyterian, Methodist, and Holiness churches.\n\nThe church also responded to the widespread social crisis. Welfare initiatives included the Holt Adoption Program, which sent over 2,000 orphans to adoptive families in the U.S. by 1959, and prosthetics and rehabilitation services for war veterans and civilians. Christian organizations built orphanages, homes for widows, rehabilitation centers, and hospitals. Figures like Torrey and John Steensma were instrumental in providing prosthetics and employment for the disabled.\n\nChristian schools played a key role in the national recovery. Institutions such as Soongsil, Ewha, and Yonsei reopened or relocated to South Korea, resuming higher education under Christian leadership. Informal education programs—including literacy classes, Bible clubs, and correspondence Bible courses—contributed both to Christian formation and national literacy campaigns.\n\nOne of the most groundbreaking developments was the introduction of the military chaplaincy system, initiated in 1951 by President Syngman Rhee. By 1955, over 330 military chaplains were serving across the Korean armed forces. Christian outreach even extended to prisoners of war: approximately 60,000 POWs converted to Christianity, and many refused repatriation to North Korea.\n\nThus, the church reconstruction movement in 1950s Korea was far more than a rebuilding of church buildings—it was a holistic endeavor to restore faith, heal a war-torn society, and spread the gospel. This period laid the spiritual and institutional foundations for the explosive growth of Korean Christianity in the decades that followed.\n\nChristian Family Life Movement 기독교여성가정생활운동\n\n\nThe Christian Family Life Movement in 1950s Korea emerged from the Christian community’s conscious effort to rebuild families amid the upheavals of liberation and the Korean War. In a society devastated by war, the family was seen as the starting point for rebuilding and as the foundation for restoring the national community. Christianity aimed to restore society’s moral and ethical order through the recovery of Christian families. In this context, Korean Christians participated in the East Asia Christian Family Life Conference held in Manila, Philippines, in November 1954. Inspired by the conference, they returned to Korea and launched the Christian Family Life Movement in earnest. In February 1955, the Christian Family Life Committee was officially established under the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK). Drawing from the Christian Family Life Movement already active in the United States, Europe, and Asia, the committee began to implement programs to instill Christian values in Korean homes. The movement emphasized the “integration of faith and life,” advocating that the Christianization of the family was essential for the moral and spiritual recovery of postwar Korean society. Educational programs were conducted nationwide, targeting churches, schools, and universities. These included lectures on Christian ethics, premarital guidance, child-rearing, and marriage counseling. At the heart of the movement was the Christian monthly magazine New Home (Saegajeong), which served not merely as a religious publication but as a practical guide for everyday family life. The magazine systematized and disseminated the theory of Christian family life, addressing topics such as marital relationships, parenting, sexual ethics, and household responsibilities from a Christian perspective. It promoted the ideal of a rational and scientifically minded housewife—an educated, responsible, and faith-driven woman who managed the household efficiently and faithfully.\n\nWhile emphasizing women’s role in the home, the movement also idealized motherhood and the moral authority of women within the family. Women were viewed as central to the transmission and embodiment of Christian ethics, both as mothers and as wives. Although this promoted a somewhat progressive image of women as active agents, it also reinforced traditional gender roles by situating their influence primarily within the domestic sphere. New Home also emphasized Christian views on love, chastity, and marriage, particularly targeting young adults with messages about premarital purity, lifelong marital fidelity, and the sacredness of the family covenant. Beyond the private sphere, the movement regarded the Christian family as a building block of the nation. Establishing sound Christian homes was seen as foundational to national reconstruction. The family was viewed as a training ground for democracy, freedom, responsibility, and moral order. With this vision, the movement became a cross-denominational effort, uniting various Christian groups around the shared goal of shaping a moral and faithful society through the household.\n\nThe Christian Family Life Movement of the 1950s, then, was not only a spiritual or religious initiative but also a cultural and social campaign that responded to the moral disarray of postwar Korea. By promoting Christian values in everyday life, it aimed to heal the broken social fabric and guide the people toward a better future. While the movement retained some limitations, especially in its reinforcement of conventional gender norms, it nevertheless played a formative role in shaping postwar Korean society and laid important groundwork for later developments in women’s welfare, family planning, and Christian social ethics.\n\nThe South Korean Military Chaplaincy\n\n\n The South Korean military chaplaincy of the 1950s was more than a matter of religious service within the armed forces. It functioned as a political and ideological apparatus tightly interwoven with the anti-communist agenda of President Syngman Rhee’s regime. The institutionalization of Christian chaplaincy during the Korean War was central to state efforts to forge legitimacy, mobilize ideology, and establish close ties between religion and national identity. Based on the two provided academic articles, this analysis offers a detailed account of how military chaplaincy emerged and operated during this pivotal decade.\n\nFollowing Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, South Korean society experienced a severe deficit of political legitimacy. Former collaborators with Japanese imperial rule continued to hold positions of power, and economic inequality deepened amidst political repression. President Syngman Rhee’s government, though outwardly promoting “freedom and democracy,” functioned in an authoritarian manner. To address its ideological void and consolidate authority, the regime strategically embraced Christianity, particularly Protestantism, as a foundational moral and ideological force.\n\nBy the late 1940s and early 1950s, Christianity had already become embedded in the upper echelons of South Korean politics. Many Protestant leaders were northern refugees who had fled religious persecution under the North Korean communist regime. They brought with them a fervent anti-communism and a readiness to align with the southern government. These church leaders, together with American missionaries, became instrumental in shaping South Korea’s emerging ideological and moral culture. Christianity was not only a spiritual force but also a symbolic bond between South Korea and the United States—its most important Cold War ally. In September 1950, just months after the Korean War broke out, the Committee for the Advancement of the Establishment of Chaplaincy in the Korean Army was formed. It included key American missionaries such as George Carroll and prominent Korean Protestant leaders like Han Kyung-jik and Yoo Hyung-ki. On February 7, 1951, a Military Religion Bureau was officially created within the personnel department of the South Korean Army. Drawing from American models, chaplains were initially civilians funded by their own denominations. They were later granted salaried and commissioned officer status by 1954. Chaplains did far more than offer religious comfort. They preached anti-communism, offered moral training, and worked to convert soldiers to Christianity—often equating Christian belief with loyalty to the South Korean state. In prisons and POW camps like the one on Geoje Island, missionaries such as Harold Voelkel and his Korean associates converted tens of thousands of North Korean prisoners. It is estimated that by 1952, more than 15,000 prisoners had become Christians, and a large number chose not to be repatriated to the North. These religious activities were also psychological and political tools used to transform potential adversaries into allies. By 1954, approximately 20% of South Korean soldiers were Christians—mostly Protestants—a stark contrast to the general population, where Christians made up only about 2%. Protestant churches rapidly constructed field churches within military units, and new converts remained loyal to their denominations after discharge, boosting church membership and influence in civilian society.\n\nMeanwhile, Korean Buddhism was largely excluded from the military chaplaincy during this period. Institutional Buddhism had suffered from its perceived collaboration with Japanese imperialism, a lack of international support, and internal divisions. Although some monks independently carried out religious activities—distributing amulets, holding funerals, and preaching Buddhist teachings—the government rejected formal petitions to include Buddhist chaplains. Despite these challenges, some Buddhist leaders, particularly in the southern regions around Busan, attempted to build informal military Buddhist communities with the support of sympathetic officers. These monks appealed to Korean nationalism by referencing traditional Silla-era military ideals, particularly the Hwarang spirit and the Five Commandments of the Buddhist master Won’gwang, which emphasized loyalty, courage, and battlefield virtue. Still, these efforts had limited institutional support and failed to counter the state’s clear preference for Christianity. In the end, Buddhist participation in military religious life was informal, fragmented, and subordinate to a Christian-dominated system. \n\nThus, military chaplaincy in 1950s South Korea was not merely a spiritual service but a tool of state-building and ideological mobilization. It served to legitimize the regime, strengthen military discipline, and promote Christianity as a national ideology. This fusion of state power and Protestant influence helped Christianity to grow rapidly and gain cultural dominance in postwar South Korea. Meanwhile, Buddhism, though still the religion of many rural and lay Koreans, remained institutionally marginalized until the 1960s and 1970s, when it began to make more formal inroads into military and state structures.\n\n\nNon-Church Movement\n\n\nThe Non-Church Movement emerged in 1950s Korea as a distinctive religious praxis that challenged both ecclesiastical institutions and state ideology, offering instead an ethic grounded in Scripture and communal life. Rather than merely rejecting institutional churches, the leaders of this movement sought to embody the essence of the gospel in social and ethical terms, especially in the midst of postwar national trauma. Kim Kyo-shin and Ham Seok-heon, along with their successors such as Ryu Daryeong and Lee Chan-gap, broadened the theoretical and practical horizons of Korean Christianity beyond institutional boundaries.\n\nKim Kyo-shin, the ideological foundation-layer of the movement, famously declared that “there is salvation outside the Church,” emphasizing a personal, scripture-centered faith rooted in ethical living. He stated, “Talk of the afterlife does not comfort me—it only breeds frustration or outrage,” adding, “What I seek is not sanctification after death, nor promises of heaven, but to reach completeness even for a single day in this body and life”. This reflects his conviction that true faith must manifest in the present world, not in eschatological speculation.\n\nThis spirit was inherited by Ham Seok-heon, who expanded Non-Church thought into historical philosophy and Minjung theology from the mid-1950s onward. In 1958, he was arrested for his political commentary in Sasang-gye, a pivotal moment that marked his resistance to both church and state authority. For Ham, the Minjung (common people) were not merely the oppressed masses, but the historical subjects through whom God’s will would unfold: “Within the word ‘Minjung’ lies a desperate hope for the historical agency of the lowest and most powerless people”. This idea would later evolve into his famed Ssi-al (Seed) philosophy.\n\nHam’s thought transcended denominational boundaries, drawing upon Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism in an effort to overcome the exclusivism of modern religion. His Ssi-al concept captured this vision: “Ssi-al are the lowest, most neglected people of this land... but they are the real agents who will transform it”. Between the late 1950s and early 1960s, he developed this theory into a complete framework of civic subjectivity, later known as citizen discourse.\n\nThis philosophical current was carried into practice by Ryu Daryeong, whose 1954 book For a New History presented the Danish folk high school and cooperative movements as a Christian model for Korea’s rural transformation. The book became immensely influential, undergoing dozens of printings, and laid the groundwork for his appointment in 1961 as the first director of the National Reconstruction Movement. Ryu later wrote that he “hung a large photo of Grundtvig on [his] wall and looked at it in prayer each morning before leaving for work”.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee Chan-gap, a direct disciple of Kim Kyo-shin, founded the Pulmu School in 1958, bringing Non-Church ideals into the realm of alternative education. Inspired by the Osan School legacy and the Danish folk high school model, he centered the curriculum on “the language and history of the people.” The Pulmu School is considered a living realization of the Non-Church emphasis on self-reliance, ethical community, and faith-based education.\n\nUltimately, the Non-Church Movement of the 1950s was not simply a rejection of institutional Christianity—it was an embodied experiment in prophetic witness, communal education, and alternative nationhood. Ham Seok-heon’s Ssi-al theology represents its ideological flowering, while Ryu and Lee’s work demonstrate the movement’s practical reach. These figures stood at the margins of both state and church, striving instead to forge a faithful path rooted in Scripture, peoplehood, and historical agency. In doing so, the Non-Church Movement became a significant waypoint in modern Korean Christianity’s journey toward liberation, education, and radical ethical engagement.\n\n\nTable 1.

Though technically democratic under the First and Second Republics, the country fell into political chaos until a 1961 military coup led by General Park Chung Hee ushered in a new era of authoritarian developmentalism. Park’s regime emphasized political stability, national identity formation, and centralized planning to achieve rapid economic growth. The government mobilized civil society under slogans like “anti-communism,” “national discipline,” and “spiritual reconstruction,” shaping a social climate where moral education and civic virtue became national priorities. This aligned closely with the goals of many Protestant institutions, including the Bible Clubs, which offered programs designed to promote self-discipline, patriotism, and moral integrity through a Christian lens. These clubs fit into a broader national strategy that sought to remake Korean citizens not only as economic actors but also as ideologically reliable subjects within a Cold War framework.\n\nDespite economic growth, South Korea in the 1960s was still predominantly agrarian. Rural communities were left behind in terms of infrastructure, education, and job opportunities. This inequality led to massive internal migration, as young people left the countryside for urban industrial centers. In response, the government launched campaigns like the Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement) in the early 1970s, but its roots were already forming in the 1960s through the National Reconstruction Movement, which sought to re-educate the countryside with the values of diligence, cooperation, and modernization. Bible Clubs in rural areas acted as early precursors to these efforts, operating as “reconstruction schools” where rural youth were taught literacy, Christian ethics, basic hygiene, and work discipline. Many youth who were excluded from formal schooling because of cost or lack of facilities found alternative forms of education and community through these clubs.\n\nThe 1960s also exposed the limits of Korea’s public education system. While elementary school attendance became nearly universal thanks to compulsory education laws, secondary schooling remained inaccessible to a large portion of the population, especially in rural and working-class urban areas. In 1960, the middle school enrollment rate was only 26.9%; by 1970 it had risen to just 40.8%. The highly competitive nature of secondary education meant that many students were either unable to enroll or dropped out early. This gap created space for non-formal educational models like the Bible Clubs. As one scholar notes, “Bible Clubs filled the vacuum left by an overstretched public education system, offering structured civic and moral training for youth in communities otherwise left behind by development.” These clubs functioned not only as church schools but also as informal civic academies that supported both academic literacy and ethical instruction.\n\nThe global Cold War and U.S. support for South Korea also shaped the ideological landscape of the 1960s. American missionaries had long played a role in Korean education, and in the postwar period, U.S.-based Protestant organizations provided funding, personnel, and curriculum support to evangelical and educational efforts across the peninsula. Christianity, especially Protestantism, was viewed favorably by the South Korean state as a moral counterforce to communism.\n\nThe Bible Club Movement operated within this Cold War matrix, emphasizing biblical literacy, anti-communist ethics, and civic engagement. Clubs often worked in tandem with local churches and foreign mission boards to produce instructional materials, train teachers, and develop faith-based approaches to civic responsibility. As such, Bible Clubs served not only as alternative schools but also as sites of ideological formation in South Korea’s larger national strategy of moral reconstruction.\n\n\nTable 2.

Amidst the aftermath of the Korean War, rapid industrialization, and the rise of a military regime, Christian education sought to redefine its identity and establish a firm foundation within a drastically changing society. This era marked a transitional phase where Christian education moved beyond mere doctrinal instruction and began to develop into a recognized academic discipline that responded to social change.\n\nSunday schools became a central site for Christian education in this context. Having been weakened during the years of war and division, they regained vitality in the 1960s alongside the rapid expansion of church membership. By 1969, the total number of Christians in Korea was estimated to be around 3.19 million. Participation was so high that Sunday school attendance in many churches rivaled the number of adult congregants. Known as \"bean sprout classrooms\" due to the overcrowded conditions, Sunday schools served not only as sites for religious instruction but also as hubs for community outreach and evangelism.\n\nThis widespread expansion is evident in statistical records. For example, in Daejeon in 1961, 8 out of 10 kindergartens were operated by Protestant institutions, and 246 out of 348 children (71%) were enrolled in Christian kindergartens. In secondary education, Protestant schools enrolled 818 out of 11,834 total middle school students (6.9% overall, 18.4% among private school students). At the high school level, 452 students attended Christian schools such as Daesung High School (122) and Hosudon Girls' High School (330), comprising 5.4% of all students and 17.2% of those in private schools. In higher education, four out of five institutions in Daejeon were Christian-affiliated, with 394 out of 2,642 students (15%) enrolled in these schools. These figures reflect the significant role Christian education played in private education during the time.\n\nIn 1960, Soongsil University established the first department of Christian education in Korea, and the following year saw the founding of the Korean Society of Christian Education. These developments institutionalized the academic study of Christian education and contributed to the formulation of denominational educational policies, the development of curricula, and the theoretical foundations of church education. The introduction of the roles of educational evangelists and education-oriented pastoral ministries also took shape during this period. \n\nDespite these institutional advancements, the internal quality of Christian education often lagged behind the church's rapid quantitative growth. Instruction remained predominantly didactic and focused on children and youth, with little attention to adult or social education. Concepts such as social justice, democracy, and human rights were rarely addressed. Kim Kwan-suk, in a 1967 issue of Christian Education, criticized the apathy of educators, referring to issues such as \"urbanization and sex,\" \"mass society indifference,\" and \"loss of identity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, government education reforms under President Park Chung-hee posed structural challenges to Christian schools. Policies such as the middle school entrance lottery (1969) and high school equalization (1973) curtailed the schools' autonomy and religious identity. The Ministry of Education attempted to limit religious instruction, and backlash from students and parents further complicated the schools' operations.\n\nNevertheless, the 1960s served as a critical foundation for the academic and institutional development of Christian education in Korea. The establishment of the Korean Society of Christian Education enabled subsequent generations of educators to bridge theological scholarship with educational practice, thus providing the groundwork for more professionalized and sustainable Christian education within churches and schools alike.\n\n\nTable 5.

Rooted in the values of solidarity, justice, and community, these Christian-led financial cooperatives offered a critical response to the harsh realities faced by laborers during a period of rapid industrialization and authoritarian rule. Protestant and Catholic churches, especially through the activities of Urban Industrial Missions (UIMs), played a pivotal role in both initiating and sustaining these grassroots economic initiatives.\n\nInitially, most credit unions were established within Catholic parish communities. For instance, in Incheon, the first credit union—Dapdong Credit Union—was founded in 1962 and was followed by similar organizations that relied on parish-based networks of trust. Of the ten credit unions established in Incheon during the 1960s, eight were formed by members of Catholic congregations. However, by the late 1960s, there was a marked transition from religious to workplace-based credit unions. This transformation began with the creation of the Daesung Credit Union in 1968, followed by the Incheon Heavy Industries Credit Union in 1969 and the Sanwoo Credit Union in 1970. These unions were established by workers in large factories and were heavily supported by the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission, which was affiliated with the Methodist Church. The UIM not only promoted these unions as a form of economic empowerment but also incorporated them into its broader mission of pastoral care and social justice.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Incheon had become home to 33 credit unions. Among them, eleven were organized through Catholic churches, five through Protestant denominations (mainly Methodist and Presbyterian), and thirteen were based on workplace solidarity. This progression from church-based to workplace-based models reflected a significant shift in the way community and solidarity were conceptualized and practiced. As one study notes, “Incheon exemplifies how the credit union movement, facilitated by the Christian Urban Industrial Mission, expanded from church-based networks to workplace and then to community-based solidarities.”\n\nA parallel movement unfolded in Yeongdeungpo, where the Yeongdeungpo Industrial Development Credit Union was founded in 1969 through the efforts of female factory workers closely connected to the Yeongdeungpo Urban Industrial Mission of the Presbyterian Church. The credit union addressed the severe financial exclusion faced by low-wage workers, many of whom had no access to bank loans and were forced to borrow from moneylenders at interest rates exceeding 72% annually. In contrast, the credit union offered loans at a much lower rate—around 24% per year—significantly easing the financial burdens of its members. This credit union, operated primarily by women, also became a site for democratic participation and social organization. Women laborers not only managed the financial operations but also led efforts to form consumer cooperatives, housing cooperatives, and other mutual aid organizations. The spirit of the movement was captured in the cooperative motto: “One for all, all for one.” As Pastor George Song, who led the mission, explained, “The labor union movement is a fight to earn more wages, while the credit union movement is a fight to protect what has been earned. They are essentially the same struggle.” Despite its success, the Yeongdeungpo credit union came under political pressure. In 1978, the government revoked its legal status after the union refused to comply with a financial audit, viewing it as an unjustified intrusion. The credit union responded by continuing its work as an unregistered cooperative called “Daramjwihoe” (Squirrel Society), maintaining its principles of economic solidarity and democratic governance in defiance of state repression.\n\nThese developments reveal how Christian missions in 1960s Korea went far beyond traditional evangelism. The Urban Industrial Missions embedded themselves in the lived realities of industrial workers, combining faith with concrete social action. Through the credit union movement, the church not only addressed immediate material needs but also fostered participatory structures that empowered marginalized communities. In doing so, the Christian credit union movement laid an early foundation for economic democratization and offered a compelling model of what a socially engaged gospel might look like in practice.\n\n\nCatholic Agrarian and Labor Movement\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, South Korea, under the Park Chung Hee regime, entered a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization, which structurally marginalized rural communities and farmers. In response to these social upheavals, the Catholic Church, influenced by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), began actively engaging in public issues based on its renewed focus on social justice and human dignity. The Church’s efforts to resolve the rural crisis centered on organizing farmers, founding cooperatives, and launching rural education programs. In this context, the Catholic Labor Youth Association (YCW) established a rural youth division in 1964, which later became the Korean Catholic Rural Youth Association in 1966. In 1972, this organization expanded into the Korean Catholic Farmers’ Movement (KCFM), which embraced adult farmers as well. Their movement combined spiritual beliefs with a pursuit of social justice through action. The movement was also closely connected with international Catholic organizations such as Misereor and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, and figures like Maria Sailer played critical roles in securing international financial and organizational support. In the latter half of the 1960s, Catholic agrarian movements took root through credit unions and farmer education initiatives. In Goesan County, Father Jang Je-nam (Clyde Davis) led the foundation of the Goesan Livestock Cooperative Association in 1968. It served not only as a livestock enterprise but also as a hub for farmer self-sufficiency, education, and community building. The association managed four pastures—Jungang, Baekyang, Goma, and Maejŏn—and expanded into credit unions and consumer cooperatives, later evolving into the Chungbuk Rural Development Association.\n\nMeanwhile, in Wonju, under the leadership of Bishop Ji Hak-sun, the Jingwang Cooperative Education Institute and Jingwang Credit Union were founded. Bishop Ji regarded cooperatives as a way to practice the Gospel in solidarity with the poor, describing them as a means for the Church to become more integrated with society. On the labor front, the Catholic Church also played a pivotal role in the 1966–68 textile labor movement on Ganghwa Island. Father Michael Bransfield, stationed at Ganghwa Parish, witnessed the dire working conditions of young women laborers and wrote to his Maryknoll superiors describing how “these young girls constantly bleed from the nose and collapse at their machines”. He requested assistance from the Catholic Labor Youth Association (JOC), which dispatched labor educator Song Ok-ja to organize female workers through catechetical and social education programs. On August 14, 1967, a labor union was established at Simdo Textile Factory, and the inaugural union ceremony was held in the convent of the local parish—a historically unprecedented event demonstrating the Church’s full support. The company responded with intimidation, firings, and threats, but union members continued to organize secretly, collecting signatures and mobilizing community support.\n\nRecognizing the severity of the conflict, Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan convened a National JOC Chaplains’ Meeting at Ganghwa Parish in July 1967. This marked the first ecumenical gathering involving Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant clergy to address labor issues collectively. Father Bransfield, at the conference, remarked, “What Koreans do not lack is knowledge of God, but rather a concern for the misery of human life and laborers’ suffering”. As the union expanded, the local employers' association began a collective boycott of Catholic workers, and the Simdo factory was shut down. The incident escalated to a national crisis, as employers and local political elites labeled the unionists as communists, while security forces surveilled and detained union leaders. Nonetheless, union head Park Bu-yang, initially appointed by management, became sympathetic to the workers and later led the resistance. Despite harsh repression, the labor union achieved its first collective agreement on November 4, 1967.\n\nThus, the Catholic agrarian and labor movements of the 1960s were not mere acts of charity or mission outreach but became acts of faith in action, confronting structural injustice in Korean society. Through cooperative organizing, labor solidarity, women's empowerment, and ecumenical collaboration, the Church underwent a fundamental transformation into an open and engaged community within Korean civil society.\n\n\nTable 7.

Korean Presbyterian churches, in particular, experienced repeated splits and reunification attempts, largely centered on differing stances regarding the World Council of Churches (WCC). The denomination eventually split into four major branches—Kosin, the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (PROK), Tonghap (the Presbyterian Church of Korea), and Hapdong—each establishing its own theological identity while also participating in interdenominational ecumenical efforts.\n\nJung Byung Joon notes, “All attempts at Presbyterian reunification during the 1960s failed, leaving deep wounds on both sides. Moreover, as each denomination was experiencing growth, they did not find reunification urgently necessary.” Nonetheless, he asserts, “it remains a crucial historical task to preserve the record of those processes and their meanings”. In 1959, a major schism occurred within the Presbyterian Church of Korea over its relationship with the WCC, resulting in a split between the Yeondong (later Tonghap) and Seungdong (later Hapdong) factions. Between 1960 and 1968, five reunification attempts were made but ultimately failed, and in 1969 the Tonghap denomination officially voted to rejoin the WCC. The first of these attempts, the 1959–1960 Yeondong-Seungdong reunification effort, fell apart due to unresolved differences. While the Yeondong faction confirmed its withdrawal from the WCC, it firmly rejected any alliance with the International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC). The Seungdong faction, meanwhile, adopted a more hardline position, demanding not only the cessation of WCC participation but also the dismissal of all Yeondong-appointed seminary faculty and a formal apology from the three foreign mission boards that supported the Yeondong General Assembly. Negotiations ultimately collapsed. A key figure reflected, “The Seungdong faction refused to reunite because they believed they would win the lawsuit. They thought that a legal victory would not only give them the seminary but also all church properties nationwide”. Despite this failure, ecumenical efforts persisted. In 1961, informal discussions began between Tonghap and the PROK, aiming at “reunion.” These efforts included pulpit exchanges and proposals for shared ministry. The PROK even passed a resolution stating its commitment to “strive for Presbyterian reunion through partial integration where possible,” though these efforts too were blocked by conservative forces. Meanwhile, debates over WCC re-affiliation intensified within the Tonghap denomination, culminating in its official decision to rejoin the WCC at the 54th General Assembly in 1969.\n\nThe theological underpinnings of the ecumenical movement during this period are reflected in WCC General Assembly themes. For example, the 1961 New Delhi Assembly was held under the theme “Jesus Christ, the Light of the World,” emphasizing the church’s calling to be a light amid global crises. According to Jung Byung Joon, this theme “called on churches to overcome division and engage in social witness in the light of Christ”. The 1968 Uppsala Assembly followed with the theme “Behold, I Make All Things New,” shifting the focus toward social participation and the church’s role in promoting justice.\n\nWithin the Korean church, a growing awareness of ecumenical identity also emerged. Ahn Kyo Seong described the Tonghap denomination as one that “understood itself as a church rooted in the ecumenical tradition of the 1907 Presbyterian Church in Korea,” and asserted that “ecumenicity is not merely about WCC affiliation but concerns the very essence of the church”. This ecumenical character was, in part, inherited from the interdenominational cooperation of early missionaries, which shaped the foundational ethos of the Korean church.\n\nWithin this historical context, Rev. Han Kyung-jik’s ministry stands as a practical embodiment of ecumenical spirit combined with evangelical commitment. His threefold mission of evangelism, education, and social service reflected a holistic vision of the church's mission. Rather than separating evangelism from social engagement, he maintained that “church social service should not remain at the level of temporary relief but should be carried out at a structural level”. Han did not view church growth or numerical increase as the sole purpose of mission; instead, he integrated social responsibility into the gospel’s witness.\n\nIn conclusion, the ecumenical movement in Korea during the 1960s, despite facing theological tensions and organizational setbacks, served as a critical period in which churches explored new forms of unity, expanded their theological horizons, and sought meaningful social engagement. The experiences of this decade laid the groundwork for deeper global partnerships, the integration of faith and justice, and the rediscovery of the public role of the church.\n\n\nMinjok Evangelization Movement\n\n\nThe Minjok Evangelization Movement that emerged in 1960s Korea was not merely a campaign to increase church membership or spread the gospel on an individual level. Rather, it represented an ambitious evangelical project aiming to save the entire Korean nation through the gospel and to reconstruct the state on Christian principles. Rooted in the traumatic experiences of national division, war, and ideological conflict, this movement was both a religious practice of healing and a theological-political attempt to fuse Christian mission with Korean nationalism and anti-communism. The ideological foundation of the movement can be traced to Rev. Han Kyung-chik, whose pastoral theology emphasized holistic transformation. As he stated in a 1947 sermon: “Evangelism is the greatest political movement, and anyone can participate in it. If we launch this evangelistic movement with Christian ideals and transform the mindset of the entire Korean people through Christian thought, then the righteous nation, an independent Christian Korea, will surely be realized.” For Han, evangelism was not confined to saving individual souls but aimed at initiating a spiritual revolution that would reform families, churches, society, and the nation. This philosophy materialized in the National Evangelization Movement of 1965, initiated by Han Kyung-chik and Kim Hwal-lan. Inspired by the Latin American model of “Evangelism-in-Depth,” this movement sought to mobilize all Korean churches in a nationwide, interdenominational gospel campaign. Han emphasized the importance of this effort, declaring, “If we designate 1965 as the Year of National Evangelization and launch a united movement encompassing all churches, this will not only benefit the church but also the nation and people.” \n\nAt the same time, the 1960s witnessed the rise of evangelical student mission organizations, with Kim Joon-gon’s Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) leading the way. Founded in 1958, CCC initially focused on campus ministry, but soon expanded its vision to encompass national transformation. In a 1971 CCC gathering, Kim declared, “Mobilizing two million Christians for evangelism is the fastest and most effective way to achieve national revolution and unification.” This perspective made evangelism the primary strategy for national salvation. CCC’s strategy was systematized through a threefold model of evangelism, discipleship, and mission-sending. While large-scale events like Explo ’74 would mark the climax of this vision in the 1970s, the strategic foundations were already being laid in the late 1960s. Under Kim’s leadership, CCC initiated mass evangelism training, local Bible study cells, and citywide spiritual campaigns such as the “Holy City Movement,” all of which reflected the logic of gospel-centered national transformation. \n\nMeanwhile, Han Kyung-chik promoted national evangelization through other means, including military and industrial mission work. His “Total Christianization of the Armed Forces” program, supported by the government, was framed as both a religious and anti-communist strategy. Conversely, his attempts to evangelize laborers through the Industrial Mission eventually met resistance due to conflicts over workers’ rights, culminating in Youngnak Church’s decision to end support for the movement in 1983. This illustrated the limitations of the movement in achieving structural social change, despite its success in fostering spiritual renewal. \n\nUltimately, the Minjok Evangelization Movement of the 1960s embodied a complex and dynamic synthesis of interchurch unity, evangelical revivalism, Christian nationalism, and anti-communism. While Han Kyung-chik focused on church unity and evangelism in the military and labor sectors, Kim Joon-gon and CCC built a highly structured student-centered mission network that aimed to disciple future national leaders. These efforts culminated in large-scale campaigns in the 1970s and played a decisive role in the rapid growth of Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nInterrelated Movements and the Minjok Evangelization Movement in 1960s\n\nThe Minjok Evangelization Movement of the 1960s was not an isolated campaign but a multifaceted evangelical response to Korea’s national division, rapid industrialization, and ideological polarization. It intersected with several key Christian movements of the time—urban industrial mission, Christian education reform, the ecumenical movement, and the Christian credit union movement. Each movement contributed to the broader framework of national evangelization in its own unique way.\n\n\nTable 8.  Connections with the Minjok Evangelization Movement\n\n| Movement Type | Connection to Minjok Evangelization Movement |\n| --- | --- |\n| Urban Industrial Mission | Practical application of evangelization in industrial labor contexts; highlighted limitations of evangelization when confronted with structural injustice. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Christian Education Movement | Provided institutional foundation for evangelization; linked gospel proclamation with leadership training and future national development. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ecumenical Movement | Enabled interdenominational unity; mobilized churches nationwide under a shared vision of national evangelization. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Christian Credit Union Movement | Embodied economic dimensions of gospel practice; extended evangelization to material conditions of life, especially among the working class and marginalized. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n\nThese interconnected movements reveal that the Minjok Evangelization Movement was not merely a spiritual or religious phenomenon. Rather, it functioned as an integrated evangelical praxis that extended into education, economic ethics, labor rights, and institutional church unity. Each movement provided complementary dimensions—urban mission grounded the gospel in real-life struggles; education ensured intergenerational continuity; ecumenism mobilized collective action; and credit unions translated spiritual ideals into economic justice. Together, these movements demonstrated that evangelization was envisioned as a holistic transformation of individuals, society, and nation.\n\n\n\nAnti-corruption Campaign by Catholic Churches\n\n\nThe anti-corruption campaign led by Bishop Ji Hak-sun in the early 1970s in the Diocese of Wonju was not merely a local protest against a single case of mismanagement; it was a turning point in the Catholic Church’s engagement with authoritarian politics in Korea. This movement, sparked by righteous indignation at institutional corruption, became a catalyst for nationwide democratic activism and transformed the role of the Church in society.\n\nThe catalyst for this movement was the corruption scandal surrounding Wonju MBC, in which the Diocese of Wonju was a minority shareholder. The station’s majority stakeholder, the 5.16 Scholarship Foundation, held 60% of the shares but failed to ensure transparent governance. Despite Bishop Ji's repeated protests, the government and the foundation ignored his demands for reform. This blatant disregard for justice ignited a deeper moral realization in Ji: “If a bishop can be treated like this, how much more would ordinary people suffer?” This experience awakened in him a sense of pastoral duty that transcended the sacristy and entered the realm of social justice.\n\nFrom righteous indignation emerged a bold and public campaign to confront institutionalized corruption. Bishop Ji organized public marches and protests demanding transparency, justice, and the eradication of entrenched political corruption. This was a courageous act during the height of the Park Chung-hee military regime, where dissent was often met with severe consequences. By directly challenging both the state and the colluding elites, Ji’s movement became the first visible sign of organized Catholic resistance to the dictatorship.\n\nBishop Ji’s anti-corruption movement evolved into a broader spiritual and political mission that called the entire Church to accountability. What began as a protest against a single instance of corruption quickly became a moral confrontation with the foundations of military authoritarianism. Ji recognized that the Church’s mission was not to retreat into spiritual neutrality but to speak out against injustice. His conviction was that “the Church must enter into society, understand its people, and give a Gospel-based response to their suffering”.\n\nThe campaign's historical significance lies in its redefinition of the Church’s social role and its inspiration of a wider resistance movement. Ji Hak-sun's protests laid the foundation for the creation of the Catholic Priests' Association for Justice, which would later become one of the most organized religious forces opposing the dictatorship. This movement also pushed the Catholic Church out of its previous posture of political detachment, bringing it into direct alignment with the struggles of the oppressed in Korean society.\n\nBy daring to speak truth to power in the face of systemic corruption, Bishop Ji’s campaign marked the beginning of a new era in Korean Christianity—an era where faith and justice walked hand in hand. His stance proved that pastoral care includes not only spiritual guidance but also the defense of human dignity against state oppression. The anti-corruption movement in the Diocese of Wonju thus serves not just as a protest, but as a prophetic voice in Korea’s modern democratic history.\n\n\nUrban Industrial Mission (UIM) and its Misson\n\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) in 1970s Korea was not merely a Christian outreach organization but a structured movement, representing a convergence of religion, social activism, and practical theology. Rooted in regionally autonomous mission stations like the Youngdeungpo Industrial Mission (YIM) and the Incheon Christian Urban Industrial Mission, this movement expanded beyond traditional evangelism to promote human dignity and industrial democracy in an era of rapid economic growth and labor exploitation. These regional missions functioned as decentralized but organized entities, linked through international ecumenical networks such as the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Leaders like Cho Ji-song, George Ogle, Jo Seung-hyeok, and Jo Hwa-soon moved into the factories, working and living alongside laborers, enacting what was called \"incarnational theology.\" Their mission was not merely to proclaim the gospel but to embody it through solidarity and structural transformation. As Cho Ji-song once critically confessed, “factory ministry itself was a mechanism of oppression that disciplined workers”. Importantly, the UIM reframed its target subjects—not as passive receivers of aid or faith but as co-agents of the mission. The Youngdeungpo Mission even rejected the traditional church hierarchy, declaring that “the worker is the church and the factory is the sanctuary.” This radical theology emerged from deep self-reflection on the limits of church language and ministry. As Jo Seung-hyeok testified, “Church language is a jargon understood only by believers—it has no meaning for workers”.\n\nSeveral landmark events during the 1970s clarified the Urban Industrial Mission’s character as a movement rather than merely an organization. The 1970 self-immolation of Jeon Tae-il, a garment worker protesting labor conditions, deeply shocked mission pastors. It catalyzed a theological shift from church-centered outreach to direct immersion in workers' lives. The Incheon Mission's Jo Seung-hyeok, who had worked undercover as a factory laborer, declared that the gospel must emerge from the lived experience of suffering.\n\nThe 1971 Kim Jin-su Incident at Han-young Textile, where the company’s hired thugs murdered a union member, also confirmed that the mission’s role was not neutral. The Incheon Mission responded by severing ties with its denomination and establishing an independent workers' church, committed to deeper engagement. In 1974, George Ogle’s forced deportation—after he publicly criticized the Park Chung-hee regime and prayed for the release of political prisoners—demonstrated the political cost of the mission's prophetic witness. His statement that “the government must abandon the constitution and build a new democracy” led to his removal, which stirred international human rights discourse.\n\nThe structure and praxis of UIM are vividly reflected in Jo Se-hee’s 1978 novel The Dwarf, which documents the industrial mission’s educational and communal ethos through its portrayal of “Eun-kang Workers’ Church.” The character Young-su attends a six-month education program teaching labor history, law, theology, and political economy. He states: “I studied the structure of industrial society, human organization, labor law, labor history, and theology”—a direct parallel to the leadership courses offered by YIM and Incheon UIM.\n\nThe Urban Industrial Mission, therefore, must be understood as a structured mission movement—combining regional organization, educational praxis, theological radicalism, international solidarity, and political resistance. The following chart summarizes the dimensions of the UIM and its ties to major events:\n\n\nTable 4.

By redefining mission as solidarity with the suffering and transformation of the structural sin of industrial capitalism, it posed a prophetic alternative to both institutional religion and authoritarian power. It remains one of the most significant models of missional engagement in Korea’s modern Christian history.\n\n\nReconfiguring Denominational Identity through Mission\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a pivotal moment in South Korean Protestantism—not merely as a period of numerical growth but as a time when major denominations redefined their identities through mission-centered transformation. Faced with sociopolitical shifts, internal theological challenges, and new opportunities for expansion, the Korean Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches responded through organized evangelism campaigns, international cooperation, and hybrid domestic-global mission structures. These efforts reshaped not only their outreach strategies but also the theological, organizational, and cultural foundations of each denomination.\n\nFor the Korean Methodist Church, the late 1960s were marked by stagnation in membership growth and an overemphasis on social engagement theology, which limited evangelistic vigor. In response, the denomination launched the nationwide “Five Thousand Churches and One Million Believers Movement” in 1974. This large-scale campaign represented a radical attempt to realign denominational focus around mission and evangelism. Supported by a detailed organizational plan and numerical targets at the district and regional levels, the movement aimed to establish 5,000 new churches and attract one million members within ten years. Its core message—“a movement of repentance and rekindled zeal for evangelism in light of ninety years of Methodist history”—captured the urgency of reformation. Between 1972 and 1974, church membership rose by tens of thousands annually, peaking at 374,710 in 1974. However, in 1975, growth dropped to just 2,398 new members, and by 1985, only 2,839 new churches had been planted—barely half of the original goal. Critics highlighted the movement’s reliance on numerical benchmarks and its lack of focus on discipleship, calling attention to the structural limitations of campaign-style evangelism.\n\nThe Baptist Church, recovering from post-war institutional weakness, rapidly expanded its membership and presence through a strategic partnership with the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) of the United States. Two key events—the Louisiana Evangelistic Crusade (1970) and the Florida Crusade (1978)—defined this decade for Korean Baptists. In the 1970 Louisiana Crusade, 81 American pastors and laypeople collaborated with Korean Baptists across 20 cities, drawing an estimated 250,000 attendees and resulting in over 11,000 public confessions of faith. These large-scale evangelistic efforts significantly contributed to the growth of Baptist churches, which reached 1,797 congregations by 1992. However, questions soon arose regarding the long-term retention and spiritual growth of these converts. Scholars criticized the lack of follow-up and discipleship systems, exposing the tension between evangelistic quantity and pastoral quality. Nonetheless, these movements helped define the Korean Baptist Church as a mission-driven, evangelical denomination with strong international linkages.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church, particularly its two dominant branches—Hapdong (Conservative) and Tonghap (Moderate)—entered the 1970s amid ongoing denominational fragmentation and theological disputes. Nevertheless, both branches experienced significant growth during this period. Between 1976 and 1977, Tonghap gained 172,132 new members, while Hapdong added approximately 60,000. This growth was fueled by massive city-based revivals, prayer mountain gatherings, and the “One Million Souls for Christ” campaign. Simultaneously, the church began developing international mission efforts, dispatching missionaries to the Philippines, Japan, and the United States. Timothy Kiho Park characterizes this dual expansion as an “integrated structure of domestic growth and international outreach,” reflecting a hybrid mission identity for the Korean Presbyterian Church. However, the denomination also faced internal theological tension between revivalist-charismatic practices and doctrinal orthodoxy, as well as debates about ecumenism and denominational unity.\n\nTaken together, the 1970s were not merely a time of growth for Korean Protestantism but a decade of missional redefinition. Each denomination responded to internal and external challenges by embracing mission not only as a practice but as the central axis for rearticulating theological identity, organizational priorities, and global engagement. These missional experiments—whether campaign-driven, cooperation-based, or hybrid in structure—shaped the long-term character and trajectory of South Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nTable 5.

At the core of this movement was the church’s conviction that faith could not be separated from freedom, justice, and resistance to tyranny.\n\nThe Korean Christian Church (PROK), emerging from a 1950s theological liberalism centered on Kim Jae-jun, had long emphasized ecumenical engagement and social mission theology. From its very inception, it promoted a version of Christianity that rejected privatized spirituality and emphasized collective, public witness. In 1964, marking its 10th anniversary, the denomination declared a need for \"self-criticism and reformation,\" urging a “church of confession” that could respond to the moral crises of the times. The denomination’s official statements throughout the 1960s and early 1970s—including the Guidelines for Church Education (1970), Social Declaration Guidelines (1971), Declaration of Faith (1972), and Mission Policy (1973)—reflect this shift toward public theology, culminating in a formalized theological resistance to state violence and authoritarianism.\n\nThe theological foundation of this resistance was deeply rooted in the concept of “Missio Dei” (God’s mission). The PROK stated that the church’s task was to participate in “God’s will and God’s mission as Creator, Judge, and Redeemer… to fulfill the apostolic role of the church in this age”. According to the church's Mission Policy, adopted in 1973, the purpose of mission was not merely evangelism but social transformation: “to make the Korean people new through Jesus Christ… and make this country into God’s kingdom”. This comprehensive theology of liberation, contextualization, and total mission (전선교) challenged the dominant evangelical revivalism of the 1970s, including events such as Explo ’74. The PROK formally distanced itself from such state-aligned mass crusades, denouncing them as spiritually shallow and politically complicit.\n\nAlongside its theology, the PROK mobilized an institutional network of clergy, professors, laypeople, and students—many trained at Chosun Seminary (later Korea Theological Seminary)—to engage in overt resistance. Key figures included Kim Kwan-suk, Park Hyung-kyu, Moon Ik-hwan, Ahn Byung-mu, and Lee Woo-jung. These leaders formed what Ko Ji-soo describes as a “Protestant intellectual network” capable of articulating and leading a coordinated response to the Yushin dictatorship.\n\nThe defining moment came after the proclamation of the Yushin Constitution in October 1972, which was perceived as a direct violation of democratic and biblical values. The regime adopted a two-faced religious policy—suppressing critical churches while rewarding compliant ones. The PROK was quickly targeted. On December 13, 1972, Rev. Eun Myung-ki of Jeonju Nammun Church was arrested during worship for allegedly violating martial law—a shocking moment, as it marked the first instance in modern Korean history where a pastor was arrested during a prayer service.\n\nThe PROK responded swiftly. On December 18, the General Assembly executive committee expressed deep regret that “a pastor praying from the pulpit was arrested while believers were forcibly dispersed.” The Jeonbuk Presbytery issued a public statement calling it “an assault not just on an individual, but on the entire church and on sacredness itself,” affirming that “actions for faith and social justice are biblical truth and divine calling”.\n\nAs Rev. Eun’s indictment revealed that he had opposed martial law and the Yushin reforms, the church recognized the event as politically motivated persecution. The incident became a rallying cry, clarifying that “today’s mission” must include resistance to unjust power, defense of religious conscience, and the right to political dissent. The church submitted petitions to the Blue House, Prime Minister, Justice Minister, and KCIA, declaring, “This kind of government action was unheard of even under Japanese colonial rule”.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1976, the PROK’s resistance took various forms: nationwide prayer meetings, public statements, petitions, and declarations of conscience. These activities were consistently nonviolent and theologically grounded. The denomination rejected both passive spirituality and violent confrontation, positioning itself as a community of active yet peaceful resistance.\n\nThe movement was deeply influenced by the PROK’s political theology of freedom. Rev. Lee Hae-young wrote that Christian freedom meant relativizing the state: “When political authority violates human dignity and freedom, it intrudes upon the realm of God… and becomes a demonic force”. Freedom, in this view, was not a civil privilege granted by the state but a theological imperative derived from the first commandment: “You shall have no other gods before me”—which meant, in this context, “Do not absolutize any person, power, system, or state”.\n\nUltimately, the PROK’s anti-Yushin movement reflected a mature synthesis of theology, organization, and social conscience. By embracing Missio Dei, freedom of conscience, and public witness, the denomination shaped one of the most consistent and theologically robust expressions of resistance in 1970s Korean Christianity. Its legacy is not only institutional but spiritual—demonstrating how faith communities can resist authoritarianism through both word and deed.\n\n\nTable 6.

This period was marked by:\n\nCoexistence and experimentation: Theological debates and political actions were shared within major denominations.\n\nUnfixed boundaries: Evangelicals occasionally engaged in social action, while Minjung theology was still in the process of being formalized.\n\nVolatile historical context: Rapid industrialization, urban poverty, the authoritarian Yushin regime, and global theological trends arrived simultaneously.\n\nMoments of cooperation and conflict: Progressives and conservatives jointly opposed certain public policies (e.g., U.S. troop withdrawal), while they also clashed bitterly over political theology, labor issues, and social justice.\n\n\n“This was a time when political engagement and withdrawal, the people and the gospel, injustice and obedience—two emerging streams—began recognizing each other and colliding.”\n\n\nFormation and Development of Progressive Protestantism\n\nCommitment to participatory faithProgressives responded to dictatorship and inequality by aligning Christian faith with social engagement.→ “The political participation of Christians must be viewed as an expression and practice of faith.”\n\nLeadership in the anti–Third Term Amendment movementRev. Kim Jae-jun's public opposition to Park Chung-hee’s constitutional changes marked a defining moment.→ “Resistance to injustice is a testimony to justice… to change a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ is the worst kind of hypocrisy.”\n\nMinistry to the urban poor and laborersRev. Park Hyung-kyu led organizing training among slum residents and laborers to foster rights-based communities.→ “Residents were trained to organize and raise consciousness, seeking ways to live with dignity.”\n\nStudent-led solidarity through disguised factory workChristian university students immersed themselves in working-class environments to build empathy.→ “They entered factories under disguise and lived among workers… to form bonds of solidarity.”\n\nTheological interpretation of Jeon Tae-il’s self-immolationProgressive Christians saw his death as parallel to Christ's crucifixion, giving rise to Minjung theology.→ “A church that ignores Jeon Tae-il’s death is one that ignores the death of Jesus on the cross.”\n\n\nFormation and Development of Conservative Protestantism\n\nDefense of church-state separationConservative leaders rejected political involvement as a distortion of the gospel’s message.→ “If Christians impose political views in Christ’s name, they degrade the gospel.”\n\nAlliance with the authoritarian regimeThey praised Park Chung-hee’s constitutional reform and emphasized obedience to leaders.→ “We must pray daily for the head of the nation and its leaders.”\n\nOpposition to progressive social ministriesConservative leaders viewed urban and labor ministries as overly politicized and spiritually misplaced.\n\nRejection of theological parallels between Jeon Tae-il and ChristMany reacted furiously to progressive interpretations of Jeon's death.→ “Do you think Jesus is that cheap?” was one of the responses, along with threats of violence.”\n\n\nConflict and Cooperation: The Essence of the Transitional Phase\n\nThe 1970s were not a time of total separation. In several instances, both camps found brief common ground.\n\nShared concerns over national identity, anti-communism, and moral decay allowed joint actions (e.g., Korea–Japan Treaty protest).\n\nHowever, interpretations of social justice and the gospel increasingly diverged, deepening theological and political rifts.\n\n\nTable 7.

The growth was not just numerical—it was deeply intertwined with this era’s tensions.\n\n\nPolitical and social instability increased spiritual demand\n\nIndustrial unrest, dictatorship, and urban poverty drove many Koreans to churches in search of solace and belonging.→ “The church functioned as an alternative community, a space of refuge and strength in a chaotic society.”\n\n\nConservative institutional growth and populist strategy\n\nConservative churches focused on mass evangelism through revivalism, prayer meetings, and programs tailored to urban migrants.\n\nMega-churches like Yoido Full Gospel Church surpassed 200,000 members by the late 1970s.→ “While doctrinally conservative, Cho Yong-gi’s church used highly modern systems to attract both working-class and middle-class Koreans.”\n\nAlliances with political powers helped secure space and resources, further fueling their expansion.\n\n\nMoral capital built by progressive leaders\n\nProgressives did not grow in numbers, but their actions—supporting democracy, justice, and the oppressed—enhanced the ethical image of Christianity.\n\n→ “Leaders like Kim Jae-jun, Park Hyung-kyu, and Moon Ik-hwan granted Protestantism moral authority in the democratization movement.”\n\n\nComplementary growth: Quantity and quality\n\nThe polarized theological streams created a dual-track growth system:\n\n| Dimension | Conservative | Progressive |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main focus | Institutional, quantitative growth | Ethical and ideological depth |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Strength | Evangelism, worship structure | Justice, human rights, intellectual discourse |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Result | Church expansion | Cultural and moral influence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n→ “Ironically, the very conflict between the two camps became a catalyst for Protestantism’s multifaceted rise.”\n\nChristian Student Movements: Evangelization and Democratization\n\nThe 1980s in South Korea were marked by a triple crisis: military dictatorship, rapid industrialization, and Cold War-era division. Amid these structural upheavals, Korean Christian student movements divided into two distinct streams. One focused on national evangelization and personal salvation, while the other stood with the oppressed and sought structural justice. Though both streams were rooted in Christian faith, their understanding and practice of the Gospel diverged sharply.\n\nEvangelical Stream: CCC and National Evangelization\n\nIn the 1980s, one of the most influential Christian student organizations in South Korea was the Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC). Founded in the early 1960s by Rev. Kim Jun-gon, CCC entered the new decade with an ambitious spiritual and national vision that went far beyond personal faith. This vision was encapsulated in the slogan: “Evangelization of the Nation, Unification of the Nation, and Globalization of the Nation.” Kim believed that South Korea, as a divided and vulnerable country surrounded by communist powers, could only be truly secure and prosperous if it was spiritually renewed through mass evangelism.\n\nTo put this into practice, CCC launched the “Ten Million National Evangelization Movement” in 1980, right after the political unrest of the previous year and the beginning of the Chun Doo-hwan regime. According to Kim, the country's political instability and moral decline were not primarily political or economic problems, but spiritual problems. In a famous address, he stated:\n\n“Evangelizing the nation is the highest form of patriotism. We must save souls to save Korea.”\n\nThe movement was not merely symbolic. CCC rapidly mobilized thousands of university students and lay Christians to spread the Gospel on campuses, in military barracks, and in neighborhoods across the country. It printed and distributed millions of evangelistic tracts, most notably the Four Spiritual Laws, a tool designed to present the Gospel in a simple, systematic format. Teams of students were trained to share their faith door-to-door, on public transportation, and at street corners. Mass events were held in auditoriums and stadiums to preach repentance and commitment to Christ.\n\nIn the early 1980s, CCC organized a series of “Holy Spirit Evangelization Conferences” in major cities like Seoul, Daejeon, and Busan, attracting tens of thousands of participants each time. The climax came in 1983, when CCC hosted the Explos ’83 World Evangelization Conference at Jamsil Olympic Stadium. With an estimated attendance of over 200,000 people, the event was the largest Christian revival rally in Korean history at that time. There, Kim proclaimed that Korea’s divine mission was not only to receive the Gospel, but to send it to the ends of the earth. One of the central declarations from the platform was:\n\n“Only a people armed with the Gospel can overcome communism.”\n\nAnother major pillar of CCC’s strategy was military evangelism. In a country where all male citizens were required to serve in the army, CCC saw the military as a powerful mission field. It trained chaplains and lay evangelists, held rallies in barracks, and handed out Gospel tracts to soldiers. The act of bringing young men to Christ during their service was framed as both a spiritual victory and a form of national defense.\n\nInternationally, CCC also developed a reverse mission strategy. Rather than only supporting Western missionaries coming into Korea, CCC envisioned Korean Christians taking the Gospel abroad—especially to the large diaspora communities in the United States, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Korean students were sent overseas during summer mission trips, not only to support churches but also to evangelize other Asian peoples as part of CCC’s vision for Korea as a “Gospel bridge” to the world.\n\nTo support and sustain this large-scale mobilization, CCC built a comprehensive discipleship training program. Students were enrolled in a four-stage progression: (1) Evangelism, (2) Maturity, (3) Commitment, and (4) Leadership. Bible studies, quiet time, and “one-to-one” mentoring formed the core of this system. By 1985, CCC reported that over 100,000 Korean students had completed some form of this training. Many of these individuals would go on to become pastors, missionaries, teachers, and even politicians and corporate leaders who carried CCC’s moral and spiritual values into other sectors of society.\n\nHowever, despite its immense scale and influence, CCC faced growing criticism for its silence on key issues of justice and oppression. It did not make any official statements or public actions regarding the Gwangju Uprising of 1980, in which hundreds of citizens were killed by military forces. Nor did CCC participate in campaigns addressing labor exploitation, the plight of factory workers, or the suppression of civil liberties. For many young activists and theologians, this lack of engagement with political and social realities made CCC appear not only apolitical, but potentially aligned with the status quo. Some scholars later argued that CCC’s focus on personal morality and national spiritual destiny led to an unintended complicity with the authoritarian regime of the 1980s, which welcomed religious groups that stayed away from political dissent.\n\nNonetheless, CCC’s legacy is significant. It created a mass movement of evangelism and discipleship among students and young adults, equipped hundreds of missionaries, and contributed to shaping Korea’s identity as one of the world’s most active missionary-sending countries. But it also left behind a theological question that still lingers: Can a faith that ignores injustice still claim to represent the whole Gospel?\n\n\nDemocratization Stream: KSCF, YMCA, YWCA, and Ecumenical Solidarity\n\nWhile the CCC led the evangelical wave of the 1980s, a distinct and deeply committed Christian student movement emerged in opposition to Korea’s military dictatorship. This movement was led by the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), in collaboration with urban YMCA branches, the YWCA, and Christian labor networks. These groups believed that Christianity could not be confined to private spirituality. For them, the Gospel demanded action in history—to stand with the oppressed, challenge unjust systems, and participate in national democratization.\n\nThe Gwangju Uprising in May 1980 became a defining event. As government troops massacred citizens protesting against Chun Doo-hwan’s illegitimate seizure of power, churches and major Christian organizations fell largely silent. But KSCF members, many of them students and youth leaders, could not remain passive. They interpreted the massacre as not just a political tragedy, but a theological crisis—a moment that forced Christians to choose between complicity and truth. In their public reflections, KSCF wrote: “To remember Gwangju is a matter of Christian conscience. The path to resurrection must pass through the cross of Gwangju.”\n\nAt a time when public gatherings were banned under Emergency Law No. 9, KSCF held clandestine prayer meetings and memorial services on university campuses and in affiliated churches. Students risked arrest by gathering to pray for the victims, to proclaim God’s justice, and to condemn violence as sin. Government authorities closely monitored these events, and in several cases, KSCF staff were detained or interrogated under the National Security Law. In response to the trauma of Gwangju and the wider social discontent, KSCF reorganized its activities toward what it called “theology on the ground.” In 1982, it formally launched the Student Social Development Corps (Haksa-dan)—a program where university students were sent not to conferences, but into the living conditions of the poor. Students moved into inner-city slums, lived with displaced communities in demolition zones, worked alongside factory laborers, and farmed with rural villagers. The aim was not to “help” the marginalized, but to learn from them what the Gospel truly meant. A former member recalled, “We stopped asking, ‘What is salvation?’ and started asking, ‘Where is Jesus suffering today?’”\n\nThis theology of presence and solidarity found institutional expression through the YMCA, particularly through student branches in universities. In 1983–84, Yonsei University YMCA launched the Namyangman Community Project, a bold initiative where students and local farmers formed intentional communities in rural areas. They worked together to plant rice, raise livestock, and run cooperatives, while holding Bible studies on economic justice and spiritual humility. Their belief was that “life in the countryside, rooted in community and simplicity, most closely resembles the Kingdom of God.” This project was not symbolic. Students physically relocated, committed to a rhythm of daily labor and shared faith, and documented the project as a model for Christian economic ethics.\n\nIn the cities, YWCA branches took on the struggle for women’s dignity and labor rights. The 1980s industrial boom had produced thousands of exploited female workers, many of them teenagers in sewing factories or electronics plants. The Seoul YWCA established labor counseling centers, where women could receive free legal assistance, attend rights education workshops, and find spiritual and emotional support. At the same time, Gwangju YWCA played a critical role during and after the Uprising. During the crackdown, it opened its facilities as shelters for injured citizens and fleeing students, defying martial law. In the following years, it became a site for trauma recovery programs, especially for women who had suffered loss or violence during the protests.\n\nAs the movement matured, it became more organized. By 1986, a nationwide Christian Young Workers' Movement, working closely with YMCA and KSCF, mobilized thousands of Christian workers and students. That year, over 3,000 participants joined a public demonstration in Seoul, calling for fair labor policies, union protection, and the moral responsibility of Christian citizens. At these gatherings, prayers were offered not just for spiritual renewal, but for a society free from corruption, injustice, and exploitation.\n\nThese actions represented more than just social concern. They embodied a theology rooted in minjung (people's) theology, liberation theology, and contextual Bible reading. Students were no longer reading Scripture in abstract—they read it in factories, protest sites, and villages. Christ was no longer found in the church building, but in the tear gas, the hunger strike, and the anonymous hands sewing clothes in midnight shifts.\n\n\nComparison and Intersection\n\nThe difference between CCC and KSCF was more than strategy—it reflected fundamentally different interpretations of the Gospel. CCC emphasized individual salvation and moral renewal, while KSCF and ecumenical groups emphasized collective liberation and public justice. CCC saw political engagement as a potential distraction from spiritual mission. KSCF saw political passivity as a betrayal of Christian faith. Despite these differences, there were occasional moments of interaction and dialogue. On some campuses, students from both groups joined in joint Bible studies and social ethics seminars hosted by local churches. A few pastors encouraged mutual understanding and communication, though such attempts remained limited and often fragile. Public perception of the two movements was also deeply divided. Conservative churches and mainstream media praised CCC for restoring moral discipline among youth, while labeling KSCF and its allies as left-leaning or radical. Meanwhile, democratization activists and international ecumenical groups recognized KSCF, YMCA, and YWCA as rare sanctuaries of free discourse and social imagination under dictatorship.\n\nUltimately, these diverging paths raised a central question for Korean Christianity: What is the role of faith in a society marked by authoritarianism, poverty, and division? Is the Gospel primarily about saving individual souls—or transforming unjust systems? For student Christians in the 1980s, this was not a theoretical question. It was a lived and often dangerous reality.\n\n\nConclusion: Between Gospel and Justice\n\nThe Christian student movements of the 1980s were not merely student ministry efforts. They represented a generation’s existential struggle over the meaning of faith in a time of national crisis. For CCC, faith meant passion for evangelism and a sense of patriotic spiritual calling. For KSCF, YMCA, and YWCA, faith demanded solidarity with the poor, prophetic resistance to injustice, and courage in the face of oppression.These two paths did not cancel each other out. Rather, they revealed the spiritual and theological breadth of Korean Protestantism. One stream deepened spiritual formation and missional fervor. The other widened the church’s ethical vision and social relevance. Looking back, they offer a mirror for today’s Christian community—a reminder that the Gospel can empower both personal transformation and collective liberation. The student movements of the 1980s continue to ask difficult questions: What does it mean to believe? Can prayer be protest? Can faith disturb injustice? These questions remain alive, urging new generations of Korean Christians to reflect, respond, and rediscover the Gospel in the world they inhabit.\n\nTable 13.

What began as suspicion and passive resistance in the 1970s gradually gave way to bold theological and practical engagement by the late 1980s. This shift was not incidental—it reflected deep theological convictions, historical responsibility, and a renewed understanding of the Church's role in society and mission.\n\n\nWhy Was Unification Important to the Korean Church?\n\nUnification was not merely a political concern for the Korean Church—it was fundamentally tied to its faith, identity, and mission:\n\nFaith Commitment: Unification as God’s Kingdom MovementUnification was seen as a tangible expression of the Kingdom of God on earth—a space where peace, justice, and reconciliation could be practiced in full.\n\n“Peaceful unification is a concrete manifestation of the Kingdom of God—where the strong and the weak live without discrimination and sing the song of hope.”\n\nHistorical ResponsibilityThe Church acknowledged its complicity in the past, especially its silence or alignment with Cold War anti-communism that had often reinforced the logic of division. Unification was thus a way to seek repentance and fulfill its ethical duty toward the nation.\n\n“Some Korean churches openly contributed to solidifying the division of the Korean peninsula by misunderstanding or even opposing God’s peace.”\n\nMissional Calling: Reconciliation and HealingParticipation in unification was part of God’s ongoing mission (Missio Dei), calling churches to act as agents of healing and reconciliation. This meant embracing both North and South as one people in need of restored communion.\n\nPreparing for Social IntegrationDrawing on lessons from German reunification, the Korean Church recognized that unification without social integration was incomplete. Churches needed to take the lead in building mutual understanding, addressing trauma, and offering models of reconciled community (Koinonia).\n\n“Even before political unification is achieved, the Church must live as a reconciled communion that anticipates the peace to come.”\n\nRestoring Fellowship with the Northern ChurchDecades of division had severed ties between churches in the South and Christians in the North. Reunification meant restoring this broken fellowship and renewing the spiritual bonds of one people under God.\n\n\nFrom Suspicion to Engagement\n\nThe immediate catalyst for change came in 1981, when news broke of a dialogue between North Korea’s Christian Federation and overseas Korean Christians, held under the title “Talks among Northern and Overseas Christians on National Reunification.” This meeting openly supported the 7.4 South-North Joint Statement and even discussed North Korea’s federal unification proposal. South Korean churches, initially shocked, began to reconsider their stance. According to historian Kim Heung-su:\n\n“The Korean churches, while opposing the dialogue itself, were influenced by it and began their own contact with the North’s Christian Federation during the 1980s.”\n\nThis shift culminated in 1988, when the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued the landmark “Declaration of the Korean Christian Churches on National Reunification and Peace.” This declaration officially accepted the core principles of the 7.4 Joint Statement—self-reliance, peaceful unification, and great national unity—and reframed unification as a matter of Christian justice and reconciliation.\n\n“Only in 1988 did the NCCK and its member denominations finally accept the 7.4 Joint Statement.”“National unification and peace are not merely political projects; they are grounded in the gospel message of reconciliation and justice.”\n\nAt the same time, theologians such as Lee Beom-seong and Shin Ok-soo developed a theology of peaceful unification, drawing from the experiences of German reunification and the concept of Missio Dei. They emphasized that the Church must fulfill both prophetic (preaching) and diaconal (service) roles.\n\n“Even if political unification has not yet occurred, the Korean Church must act now to embody reconciled communion (Koinonia).”\n\n\nDemocratization Movement\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Christianity in South Korea played a critical yet complex role in the nation’s democratization movement. Christian institutions, particularly progressive factions of Protestantism and the Catholic Church, became not only moral voices but also institutional bases for resistance. Their roles ranged from providing sanctuary for protestors to initiating transnational solidarity, while simultaneously revealing internal divisions, contradictions, and complicity in the era of rapid church growth.\n\nChristianity provided crucial organizational space and moral legitimacy for activists resisting authoritarianism. The Myeongdong Cathedral became a symbolic sanctuary, repeatedly sheltering student protesters and labor leaders. In the 1987 June Democratic Uprising, the cathedral served as the central sit-in site. As Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan famously stated in response to the state’s 1995 intrusion, “This is a desecration of the birthplace of the very government that now violates it”.\n\nProtestant organizations such as the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) and the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) played pivotal roles in the labor movement and in articulating a theology of resistance. The UIM, for instance, declared that “there can be no Kingdom of God on this earth where laborers are trampled” and established solidarity communities that bridged faith and class struggle.\n\nThe Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) emerged in direct response to the 1980 Gwangju Uprising. It declared, “Gwangju is the Cross of our nation,” and transformed grief into ritual resistance through annual memorial Masses and international advocacy. The group’s activities—ranging from exposing torture victims to issuing public denunciations—framed political resistance as an ethical duty of faith.\n\nChristian groups also enabled international communication. WCC (World Council of Churches) and affiliated ecumenical organizations in Germany and Japan provided platforms through which South Korean dissidents informed global audiences, lobbied for political prisoners, and received financial and moral support. As Misook Lee argues, this “transnational ecumenical network of communicative interaction” was crucial in circumventing domestic censorship.\n\nNevertheless, the relationship between Christianity and democratization was not unilaterally supportive. Evangelical megachurches and conservative denominations often remained silent or even cooperative with the authoritarian state. Jin-ho Kim refers to this as “anachronistic growth,” where the obsession with numerical expansion alienated Protestant churches from civil society and weakened public trust in religion.\n\nOrganizations like CCC (Campus Crusade for Christ) continued their mission of “Evangelizing the Nation, Unifying the Nation, Globalizing the Nation,” prioritizing large revival meetings over public engagement or critique of state violence. This divergence created clear ideological rifts between liberation theology–inspired movements and revivalist evangelicalism.\n\nDespite these tensions, international scholars affirm the significant role of Christianity in Korea’s democratic transition. Samuel Huntington described the churches as “the principal forum for opposition” in the 1980s, while Bruce Cumings emphasized their role as “sanctuaries immune from state intrusion”.\n\nIn sum, Christianity in 1980s South Korea occupied a paradoxical role—offering moral refuge and international solidarity on one hand, and ideological conflict and institutional ambivalence on the other. This dual nature reflected broader questions of what it meant to be the church in times of authoritarian crisis.\n\n\nTable 15.

Democratization has typically been viewed through the lens of political freedom and civil rights, while unification has been framed as an issue of diplomacy, security, and ideology. However, when examining the role of Christianity, it becomes clear that these two movements were deeply interconnected. The Church’s engagement in the democratization movement was an expression of its theological commitment to justice and human dignity, and its later turn toward the unification movement was a natural extension of that same moral responsibility—reaching beyond political change toward national reconciliation and healing.\n\nA unified narrative allows us to see that Korean Christianity was not merely reacting to historical events but actively envisioning a new social order grounded in faith. When democratization and unification are treated separately, the Church’s role appears fragmented; when they are integrated, we can better understand how theological themes such as the practice of justice and the proclamation of reconciliation were embodied in history. It reveals the Church not just as a political actor but as a community acting out of spiritual conviction and historical accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, writing a synthesis of democratization and unification movements is not only a matter of historical completeness—it is a necessary shift in perspective to grasp how faith communities responded holistically to the demands of their time. This integrated view challenges both the Church and civil society today to revisit the enduring questions of justice, peace, and communal life with renewed purpose.\n\n\nKorean Christian Diaspora and the Movements for Democracy and Reunification\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Korean Christian communities in Germany, Japan, and the United States emerged as moral voices of resistance, reconciliation, and justice. Their movements did not divide democracy from reunification, nor did they separate faith from action. Rather, they offered a theology practiced in prayer, protest, and deep international solidarity. These movements grew out of distinct contexts, but were united by one question: what does it mean to be the church in an age of dictatorship, division, and diaspora?\n\nThis essay deliberately does not draw a hard line between democratization movements and reunification movements among overseas Korean Christians. For those involved, the struggle against authoritarianism and the longing for national unity were not separate causes. Both were expressions of a deeper theological and ethical conviction—that justice could not stop at political reform, and peace could not be achieved without healing the division of the Korean people. As one pastor in Germany put it, “We could not preach democracy on Sunday and forget the pain of division on Monday.” The pursuit of democracy and the dream of reunification flowed together in their prayers, petitions, and public acts of conscience.\n\nBy organizing this narrative thematically rather than separating by region or political category, we uncover the transnational structure of Korean Christian activism in the diaspora: a structure held together by faith, memory, moral clarity, and shared vulnerability. The lines between protest and prayer, between theology and testimony, were intentionally blurred by those who believed that to follow Christ meant to stand with the oppressed—whether they lived under dictatorship or across a border sealed by war.\n\n\nGermany\n\nThe Korean Christian diaspora in West Germany emerged from a convergence of labor migration and theological reflection. Korean miners and nurses, sent under a bilateral labor agreement, found themselves immersed in German society while yearning for political change in Korea. Alongside them were theology students who saw the division of Korea and the repression of democracy as spiritual crises. Rev. Jang Sung-hwan, dispatched by the Korean National Council of Churches in 1972, quickly transformed his role from pastoral care to political education. In Bible studies, he taught labor law, human rights, and the theological meaning of resistance. “The gospel,” he preached, “is not an opiate—it is an alarm bell that wakes us to injustice.” When the Yushin Constitution was declared, Jang led protests in Bonn and was eventually denied access to some worker dormitories. One administrator told him, “You’re not just a pastor, you’re a threat.” To this, Jang replied, “Then I follow the same path as the prophets of old.” The May 1980 Gwangju Uprising shook the Korean communities in cities like Bochum and Heidelberg. One miner recalled, “We wept in the church basement all night. And in the morning, we began planning our protest.” These sentiments gave birth to the May People’s Festival in Europe, held annually since 1980. It became a site of liturgical resistance, combining poetry, lamentation, political education, and communal prayer. The theological framework for this movement was laid by Dr. Lee Young-bin, who proposed a “Third Space Theology” rooted in Karl Barth’s dialectical theology. “The church must not stand with the Right or the Left,” he wrote, “but where God stands—in reconciliation.” He founded the Korean Christian Overseas Reunification Association, one of the earliest efforts to promote direct dialogue between South and North Korean churches. “Faith,” Lee said, “must be a bridge across ideologies, not a wall behind which we hide.”\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nIn Japan, Korean Christians were not recent migrants but rather long-standing Zainichi residents—descendants of colonial laborers and settlers. Their faith emerged in the margins of Japanese society, shaped as much by ethnic discrimination as by spiritual conviction. The Korean Christian Church in Japan (KCCJ) provided not only worship but also a center for political and social advocacy. In 1970, when Korean youth Park Jong-seok was denied a job by Hitachi due to his nationality, Rev. Lee In-ha, pastor of a KCCJ church in Kawasaki, responded by organizing a support network. This movement eventually grew into the Network Against Ethnic Discrimination, which documented injustices and mobilized a broad coalition for civil rights. “To defend Park,” Lee said, “is to defend the image of God in every marginalized person.” In the 1980s, KCCJ collaborated with the National Christian Council of Japan (NCCJ) to oppose the fingerprinting of foreign residents. In 1985, churches across Kawasaki and Tokyo declared a “Korean Human Rights Sunday”, during which 12 Korean residents publicly refused fingerprinting in an act of civil disobedience. Their declaration was bold: “We are not criminals. We are children of God.” Beyond civil rights, the Japanese Christian network also played a pivotal role in North-South Korean dialogue. In 1984, the Tozanso Consultation marked the first postwar unofficial meeting of Christians from both Koreas, facilitated by Japanese churches. In 1986, at the Glion Meeting in Switzerland, South and North Korean church leaders shared communion. A KCCJ member later said, “We cried. Not because we agreed on politics, but because we remembered we were one in Christ.”\n\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Korean American Christian diaspora was socioeconomically diverse, including early immigrants, political refugees, and a rising generation of 1.5 and second-generation youth. But the Gwangju Massacre in 1980 became a spiritual turning point. Many Korean Americans who had remained silent now found their voice through their faith. Yoon Han-bong, a prominent Gwangju activist, arrived in Los Angeles after a dangerous escape from Korea. Instead of living quietly in exile, he founded Young Koreans United (YKU), a progressive Christian movement. He described it as “madang theology,” a courtyard theology rooted in community, activism, and reflection. “We do not gather to escape. We gather to act,” he said. YKU members lived in shared houses, organized political education programs, and launched campaigns for nuclear disarmament, North Korean human rights, and repatriation of unconverted prisoners. They also organized annual Gwangju commemorations, often inviting victim families and interfaith speakers. “Reunification,” one YKU pamphlet read, “is not a political slogan. It is a sacred promise—to mend what was broken, to return what was scattered.” The movement was grounded in churches. Thousands of Korean churches across the U.S. opened their spaces for prayer meetings and advocacy. In Los Angeles, the Thursday Prayer Meeting became a gathering where activism followed immediately after prayer. One young participant recalled, “We would pray with tears. And after the ‘Amen,’ someone would say, ‘Let’s write to our congressman.’ That’s what discipleship looked like.” YKU found broader support through the North America Human Rights Coalition (NHRK), which linked churches, NGOs, and U.S. policymakers. Their mission was clear: “Freedom is a God-given right. Gwangju is a global concern. The gospel does not remain silent.”\n\n\nDemocracy and Reunification as One Spiritual Calling\n\nIn all three regions, Korean Christians did not draw sharp lines between democratization and reunification. They understood both as parts of a larger divine mandate—a call to heal division and oppose injustice.\n\nIn Germany, Lee Young-bin asserted that “To speak of human rights without speaking of peace between North and South is to close one eye. The gospel sees with both eyes—truth and reconciliation.” In Japan, Lee In-ha proclaimed, “We are not simply Korean or Japanese citizens. We are watchmen for the marginalized across the world. Reunification is the cry of the displaced, and the hope of the divided.” And in America, Yoon Han-bong often reminded his followers: “We don’t want a democracy that ends at the DMZ. We want a Korea where no one is forgotten—north or south, past or present. This is not politics. This is justice. This is faith.” These weren’t slogans. They were radical reinterpretations of Korean Christianity itself. Through liturgy and organizing, protests and petitions, diaspora churches became laboratories for a faith that refused to be neutral in history.\n\n\nTable 16.

The rise of the Charismatic movement—emphasizing supernatural experiences such as speaking in tongues, healing, prophecy, and exorcism—provoked strong opposition from conservative theology. Two central figures shaped this confrontation: Pastor David Yonggi Cho of the Yoido Full Gospel Church, and Pastor Ki Dong Kim of Sungnak Church and the Berea Academy.\n\nPastor Cho emphasized the Pentecostal doctrine of the “Baptism of the Holy Spirit,” combined with his signature “Threefold Blessing”—salvation of soul, healing of the body, and material prosperity. He taught, “The gospel is not only about saving souls, but also healing diseases and liberating people from poverty”. His message resonated with a rapidly urbanizing and economically struggling population, helping the Yoido Full Gospel Church become the largest congregation in the world.\n\nIn contrast, Pastor Kim centered his ministry not only on spiritual gifts but on a unique theology of demon possession, the realm of the dead (Sheol), and angelic corruption. He argued, “Demons are the souls of deceased unbelievers, and even believers can be possessed”. He insisted that illnesses and life misfortunes result from demonic intrusion, and that only exorcism could solve them. He justified these teachings through thousands of cases he had allegedly experienced in ministry.\n\nConservative theologians responded strongly. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PROK) declared Pastor Cho’s theology “pseudo-Christian,” citing concerns over his Threefold Blessing and a controversial “resurrected maiden” testimony. However, Cho actively defended himself and clarified his doctrines. By 1993, the PROK lifted the heresy label after review. Cho’s theology remained within the bounds of orthodoxy, as he upheld traditional doctrines like the Trinity and salvation. In contrast, Pastor Kim faced a series of formal heresy verdicts from PROK, Hapdong, Koshin, and the Baptist Convention. His view that demons are souls of the dead clashed with biblical demonology, which traditionally identifies demons as fallen angels. His claim that “the entire world is Sheol, a place where these spirits roam,” was seen as a distortion of Christian eschatology.\n\nThis controversy revealed not merely doctrinal disagreements, but a deeper cultural-theological divide. Conservative theology, grounded in systematic exegesis and Reformed orthodoxy, values order, liturgy, and objective scriptural authority. The Charismatic movement, by contrast, emphasized experiential faith, direct emotional encounter with the Holy Spirit, and practical results such as healing and financial blessings.\n\nKim’s theology went further: he linked demons to physical illness, suicide, addiction, and mental distress, and taught that exorcism was necessary for deliverance. “Demons, as the spirits of unbelievers, wander the earth until their natural lifespan is completed,” he claimed. “They cause all misfortunes, and must be driven out through spiritual warfare”. For many conservative theologians, this resembled shamanism cloaked in Christian terminology. Cho, on the other hand, avoided explicit doctrinal conflict. Though criticized for emphasizing blessing and prosperity, he did not promote doctrinal deviations. He maintained ongoing dialogue with denominations and steered the Yoido church toward global evangelical legitimacy, eventually chairing the World Assemblies of God Fellowship (WAGF).\n\nFrom 1985 onward, Kim was officially condemned as a heretic by most major denominations in Korea. He separated from the institutional church, establishing Sungnak Church as an independent body and rejecting dialogue. His theology was never reconciled with Protestant orthodoxy. Cho, in contrast, re-engaged with the institutional church, clarified his teachings, and had the pseudo-Christian label lifted. His church became a model for global charismatic growth, especially among non-Western churches.\n\n\nTable 18.

The founders, including physicist Kim Young-gil, envisioned creation science as an apologetic alternative to evolutionary biology. They emphasized “scientific evidence” for a literal reading of Genesis, and Kim declared, “The Bible is the true science textbook”​. The KACR's publications, such as Is Evolution Scientific Fact? (1981), quickly spread through churches and student ministries. By the 1990s, creationism had become mainstream within Korean evangelical circles. KACR expanded its influence through public lectures, textbooks like 창조론 대강좌 (1996), and science-themed exhibitions. The creation science exhibit at KAIST, established in 1993, stood as a symbolic validation of their scientific credibility​. Yet their approach remained focused on young-earth creationism (YEC) and a singular global flood model, resisting broader academic critique.\n\nA major turning point occurred when Professor Yang Seung-hoon—a prominent KACR member—began to adopt a position closer to old-earth, multi-catastrophe creationism. In 2006, he published Creation and Catastrophe and asked his publisher to withdraw his previous YEC textbook from circulation. Yang stated, “Young-earth creationism is certainly wrong; I see no need to cling to it anymore”​. This shift, initially overlooked by KACR leadership, soon triggered institutional rupture.\n\nIn 2007, Yang and theologian Cho Deok-young launched the Open Forum for Creationists to foster pluralistic dialogue among Christians interested in creation. Its motto welcomed “anyone with an open mind toward different theological and scientific interpretations of creation”. The forum hosted academic symposia and published nearly 200 articles from 2007 to 2017. Topics included intelligent design, old-earth models, and critiques of YEC. This marked a decisive shift from popular apologetics to scholarly engagement. However, the forum’s pluralism provoked backlash. In 2008, KACR formally expelled Yang Seung-hoon for promoting old-earth views. Their justification cited over 30 non-peer-reviewed sources and was led by a faculty member in web design, not geology. Even CCC founder Kim Joon-gon, who had supported KACR since its inception, called Yang directly to request he shut down the Open Forum—an appeal Yang respectfully declined.\n\nMeanwhile, the rise of theistic evolution further diversified Korea’s evangelical discourse. Figures like Woo Jong-hak and Choi Seung-eon, both physicists trained in the U.S., publicly challenged YEC. Woo founded Dialogue Between Science and Theology (과신대) and gained traction among younger Christians via social media. His proposed lectures were repeatedly canceled by conservative institutions, including Handong University and Chongshin University, due to theological backlash.\n\nThe conflict reached the public sphere in 2012, when the Society for Textbook Revise (STR)—an offshoot of KACR—successfully petitioned the Ministry of Education to remove references to Archaeopteryx and horse evolution from high school science textbooks. The ministry did not consult scientific experts and merely relayed the petition to publishers, many of whom complied. Evolutionary biologist Jang Dae-kyung lamented, “There are only 5–10 evolutionary scientists in the country… the scientific community has done little to resist”​. This moment marked global embarrassment. Nature and Scientific American ran critical features, warning that Korea had surrendered to pseudoscience in a way unmatched even in the U.S.. The backlash prompted some officials to reverse the decision later that year. Then, in 2017, under President Moon Jae-in, the nomination of Park Seong-jin—a KACR board member—for Small and Medium Business Minister sparked national uproar. In a confirmation hearing, Park claimed, “The age of the Earth differs between science and faith,” and acknowledged belief in a 6,000-year-old Earth \"in church\" while accepting older ages “scientifically.” This dual-language undermined his credibility, and he withdrew within weeks. After Park's resignation, KACR saw a decline in young scholars' participation. According to internal sources, even co-authoring a paper with creationists became politically risky. The momentum of the movement, once buoyed by mass appeal and church support, was now facing institutional and cultural marginalization.\n\n\nContemporary Christian Music (CCM) Movement\n\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) movement in South Korea marked not merely the introduction of a new genre but a transformational shift in the form of worship, spiritual expression, and the church’s engagement with youth and culture. Praise teams emerged as a key force driving the transition from traditional, choir-led services to participatory, emotion-centered worship that resonated deeply with modern sensibilities. In contrast to many Western churches, Korean churches saw this transformation spread rapidly and broadly, due to structural, cultural, and socio-political conditions unique to Korea during this era.\n\nAmong the leading figures of this transformation was Choi Deok-sin, who founded Joochan-yang Missionary Group in 1981 and began composing CCM pieces that blended modern musical techniques with deeply theological messages. His iconic song “His Name”, based on a poem by Song Myung-hee and released in 1985, sold over 300,000 copies—an unprecedented achievement that helped shift Christian music from the category of gospel songs to an emerging identity as CCM. The piece used suspended chords (sus4, sus9), syncopation, dotted rhythms, and triplets—harmonic elements rarely seen in earlier Korean Christian music—to convey what he called “the awe and mystery of Jesus”. Choi was not only a composer but also served as a producer, mentoring and producing albums for later CCM artists such as Park Jong-ho, Song Jung-mi, and Choi In-hyuk. His contribution to the sonic and aesthetic framework of Korean CCM positions him as a “producer of worship culture” rather than a mere musician.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the emergence of the Praise & Worship movement through the influence of international worship ministries such as the UK’s Praise & Worship series. Ha Yong-in (Hasdeban) played a key role in introducing this style in 1987, and the Duranno Thursday Praise gatherings institutionalized a “celebratory” model of worship that included drums, synthesizers, and even liturgical dance. “The shift to celebratory worship was a revolution,” writes one researcher, “especially in a time when preaching had been the entirety of worship”. “Jesus Abbey and Youth With A Mission (YWAM) helped lead the praise gatherings in Korea that adapted the structure and spirit of Vineyard-style worship”.\n\nChristian broadcasting played a vital role in the spread and popularization of CCM. Stations like CBS and Far East Broadcasting Company aired programs such as Gospel Hour, Songs of Peace and Love, and Truly Joyful Songs, introducing both domestic and international CCM to broader audiences. Gospel Hour, hosted by singer-songwriter Ha Deok-kyu in 1989, became a milestone for CCM’s nationwide dissemination.\n\nCCM was not limited to musical aesthetics—it also became a key part of Korea’s Christian movements in the 1980s, connecting deeply with spiritual and social agendas such as reunification prayer meetings, healing ministries, and youth revival camps. Worship teams were central to these gatherings, fostering communal emotion and theological reflection through song.\n\nA representative piece is Koh Hyung-won’s “As the Waters Cover the Sea,” a praise anthem whose repeated declaration—“The knowledge of the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea”—helped unite congregants in corporate hope and mission. Another major figure was Kim Do-hyun, who carried the legacy of 1980s CCM aesthetics into the 2000s with fresh innovation. His hit “The Holy Spirit Has Come” integrated blues harmonies and rich harmonic tensions, expanding the musical vocabulary of Korean worship music. His albums were structured as narrative works with theological and healing themes, such as his collaboration with filmmaker Kim Woo-hyun on the documentary Beatitudes.\n\nThe 1980s was also a time of domestication of imported gospel music. Korean composers like Kim Suk-kyun, Joo Sook-il, and Kim Min-sik began producing original works infused with Korean emotional sensibilities and spiritual themes. These works helped transform imported gospel into a contextualized, indigenous expression of Korean Christianity.\n\nTherefore, this decade should be understood not as a period of mere musical introduction but as the formative era of Korean CCM. Four key features emerged: (1) the establishment of CCM as a distinct genre; (2) the shift from traditional choir worship to participatory praise; (3) the rise of artist-led production and distribution; and (4) the use of CCM as a strategic tool for cultural evangelism and youth ministry. This foundation laid the groundwork for the 1990s industrialization of worship, concert-style services, and the global export of Korean CCM. Ultimately, CCM in 1980s Korea became both “an art that structures worship” and “a cultural vehicle for experiencing the Gospel.” It redefined how churches engaged with society, and how believers expressed their faith—with beauty, passion, and sound.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Mission Movement\n\n\nThe cross-cultural missionary movement of the Korean church began in earnest in 1912, when the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea resolved to send missionaries to Shandong Province in China. This decision marked a clear departure from earlier efforts aimed at ministering to Korean diaspora communities or remote domestic regions. Prior to this, most missionary activity had targeted culturally homogeneous groups. For example, in 1907, Rev. Lee Ki-Poong was dispatched to Jeju Island following the formation of the Korean Presbytery, a move motivated by the desire to evangelize an unreached area within Korea. Similarly, Choi Kwan-Hol was sent to Vladivostok in 1909, and Han Seok-Jin to Japan, both to minister to Korean immigrants residing there. However, the missionaries sent to China in 1913—Park Tae-Ro, Kim Young-Hoon, and Sa Byung-Soon—were trained to preach in Chinese and were tasked with evangelizing to Chinese nationals. Han-Sung Kim identifies them as the first genuinely cross-cultural missionaries in Korean church history: “The missionaries dispatched in 1912 were the first Korean missionaries with the calling to evangelize Chinese people in their language”.\n\nThis decision, radical for its time, marked a critical transformation of the Korean church from a passive recipient of Western missionary efforts to an active participant in global mission. This took place just 30 years after Suh Sang-Ryun was baptized by John Ross in Manchuria in 1883 and returned to Korea to share the gospel, and less than 30 years after the arrival of Horace G. Underwood and Henry G. Appenzeller in 1885. Despite the brief history of Protestantism in Korea, the church demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to cross-cultural missions. This period, lasting from 1912 to 1955, is thus classified as the formative or preparatory phase of Korean cross-cultural missions. Even during national crises such as Japanese colonial rule (1910–1945) and the Korean War (1950–1953), the flame of Korean missions was never fully extinguished.\n\nFollowing the devastation of the Korean War, the Korean church rekindled its missionary zeal. In 1955, Rev. Choi Chan-Young became the first missionary dispatched after the war, sent to the Philippines. He left behind a war-torn homeland to devote himself to gospel ministry and church planting in Manila. While the number of missionaries remained small throughout the 1950s to the late 1970s, churches and missionary organizations gradually began to develop sending structures and training programs. Han-Sung Kim refers to this period as the \"pioneering phase\" and notes that it “is summarized as the mission work of a small number of missionaries focused on Asia”. These early missionary efforts largely targeted nearby regions such as Southeast Asia, Japan, and Taiwan, and were still lacking in strategic maturity and field experience.\n\nA clear leap forward began to take shape in the late 1970s. A pivotal turning point was the 1973 Billy Graham Crusade held at Yeouido Plaza in Seoul, where over one million people gathered. Graham emphasized repentance and the urgency of evangelism, embedding within Koreans the dual vision of national and global evangelization. Jang Yun Cho describes this moment as follows: “The Billy Graham evangelistic crusade held in Seoul, Korea, in 1973, pulled the trigger for both the modern Korean missions movement and the evangelical movement”. In 1974, the Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (KCCC) hosted EXPLO '74, a mass evangelistic conference that drew a record-setting 2.7 million people in a single gathering—then the largest in Christian history. This event inspired thousands of young Koreans to embrace a vision for world missions. Cho notes, “These two mass evangelistic conferences made a great impact on Korean believers for both national evangelization and world missions”.\n\nFollowing these events, Korean mission agencies either emerged or significantly strengthened their infrastructure. Organizations such as the Global Missionary Fellowship (GMF), Global Mission Pioneers (GMP), Global Bible Translators (GBT), Korean Presbyterian Mission (KPM), and Helping Overseas Professional’s Employment (HOPE) developed during this preparatory phase for the global expansion of Korean missions. Notably, evangelical campus ministries like CCC, UBF, and IVF began forming pipelines for missionary recruitment, laying the groundwork for the Mission Korea movement that would formally launch in 1988.\n\nThus, the period from 1955 to 1989 represents a transitional phase, from small-scale, hardship-driven efforts to a more structured and expansive leap forward. The Korean church came to see missions not just as a noble calling, but as a necessary outcome of church revival and growth—a conviction that formed the foundation for its emerging identity as a sending church.\n\nThe overseas missions movement of the Korean church in the 1990s must be understood as the culmination of a series of theological, historical, and institutional developments that began decades earlier. Its roots can be traced to 1912, when the Korean Presbyterian Church, commemorating the establishment of its General Assembly, decided to send its first cross-cultural missionaries to Shandong, China. Unlike earlier missionaries such as Yi Ki-pung (Jeju Island, 1907), Choi Gwan-hol (Vladivostok, 1909), and Han Seok-jin (Japan, 1909), who served within the Korean diaspora, the 1913 missionaries were charged with the unprecedented task of evangelizing Chinese people in their own language and cultural setting. This decision came barely thirty years after Protestant Christianity first entered Korea, and it marked the beginning of Korea’s cross-cultural missions history, revealing a remarkable ecclesial boldness for such a young church. As Kim Hansung notes, “Although Korean Protestantism had only just begun to take root, it launched a full-scale foreign missions effort—a movement unparalleled among non-Western churches of the time”.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Korea’s missionary movement remained modest in scale. However, the post-Korean War years saw the emergence of a new missionary consciousness. The 1950s to 1970s, often labeled the “pioneering phase,” were characterized by the sending of small numbers of missionaries, mostly within Asia. The missionary count remained limited: by 1972, Korean churches had dispatched only 33 missionaries abroad. But things began to change dramatically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The turning point, many agree, was the 1973 Billy Graham Crusade in Seoul, which mobilized mass audiences and reinvigorated the evangelical impulse in Korean Christianity. According to Cho Jang Yun, this crusade, followed by the 1974 Explo '74 organized by Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC), “triggered not only a national revival movement but also a new missionary vision among evangelical Christians”.\n\nIt was during this period that the foundational ideas and structures of the modern Korean missions movement were laid. By 1986, the number of missionaries had risen to 511, although 75% were still ministering primarily to Korean populations abroad. The movement was still in a preparatory phase—what Cho calls a “teenage stage”. The real explosion came in the 1990s.\n\nOne of the most decisive events in launching this explosion was the founding of Mission Korea in 1988. Mission Korea was a nationwide interdenominational missions conference that brought together a wide coalition of student ministries, including IVF, CCC, UBF, YWAM Korea, JOY, and others. Held biennially, the first Mission Korea conference marked a symbolic and organizational milestone in Korean missions. The 1990 conference was particularly pivotal. As Cho recounts from personal experience, “On the final night, during George Verwer’s challenge for overseas missions, over 2,000 students stood up to dedicate their lives to mission work. I was among them”. This moment captures how Mission Korea served as the Korean version of the Student Volunteer Movement—a movement that deeply inspired early American missionaries to Korea. The Korean slogan “World Evangelization in Our Generation” was consciously modeled after that of the SVM.\n\nStatistically, the growth in missionary numbers during the 1990s was unprecedented. In 1994, there were 3,272 Korean missionaries serving in various countries. By 1996, that number had risen to 4,202. In 1998, it reached 5,948. This meant that in just one-decade, Korean overseas missions had more than doubled, positioning Korea as the world’s second-largest missionary-sending country after the United States.\n\nThis explosion was the product of several converging factors. The first was church growth. The 1980s had seen Korean Protestantism surpass ten million adherents. Churches had not only grown in number and size, but in financial capacity and strategic vision. “Mission,” in many congregations, came to be seen as the natural sequel to revival. As Cho observes, “There was a communal imagination that the fruit of revival must be missions”.\n\nSecond, Korea’s economic development provided the material base for mission expansion. The post-Olympics boom and the rise of a stable middle class allowed churches and individuals to support long-term missionaries. Self-funded or bi-vocational missionaries became common, and local churches increasingly took on the financial and logistical burdens of sending and supporting missionaries.\n\nThird, the missionary movement became a popularized movement—a movement of the whole church. It was no longer limited to pastors or elites. Evangelical theology emphasized that every believer was a missionary, and this belief translated into concrete mobilization: conferences, youth camps, church seminars, and family mission trips became regular features of church life throughout the 1990s.\n\nKorean missionary efforts also matured theologically and strategically during this period. Theologically, the movement was grounded in a robust evangelical framework. The authority of Scripture, the uniqueness of Christ, and the universality of the Great Commission formed the non-negotiable core. But this foundation also gave rise to new theological emphases, including the missio Dei, incarnational mission, and contextualization. Cho notes that, “Korean missions theology developed from a simple proclamation model to one that includes cultural understanding, social engagement, and cross-cultural discipleship”.\n\nStrategically, the movement diversified its methods. The 10/40 Window became a widely adopted framework, drawing attention to the vast, unreached populations in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Korean missionaries began entering “creative access” nations, often under the guise of professionals—teachers, engineers, doctors, and nurses—who could work and witness without official missionary visas. The business-as-mission (BAM) model also gained traction, as Korean entrepreneurs used their businesses to gain access to closed countries and create platforms for evangelism and discipleship.\n\nMeanwhile, the structure of missionary sending also diversified. Denominational mission boards, such as those of the Hapdong, Tonghap, and Koshin Presbyterian Churches, played a central role in long-term pastoral training and traditional church planting missions. But interdenominational agencies like GMP (Global Mission Pioneers), GMF (Global Missionary Fellowship), and GBT (Global Bible Translators) provided a flexible, lay-oriented path for teachers, women, and non-clergy to enter the field. Additionally, megachurches such as Yoido Full Gospel Church and Onnuri Church began to form their own in-house mission departments, bypassing both denominational and parachurch structures. These churches offered comprehensive systems of missionary training, funding, field support, and accountability. This “church-based mission” model allowed for a more agile and contextually responsive approach to global missions.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, the Korean church had fully transitioned from being a mission field to becoming a mission force. The missionary movement had become embedded not only in institutional structures, but in the spiritual imagination of the Korean evangelical public. As Cho concludes, “This movement has changed the agenda and atmosphere of the Korean church. It has had a great impact on the lives of Christians and on Korean society”.\n\n\nNorth Korean Mission Movement\n\n\nThe surge of North Korean mission efforts in the 1990s was a comprehensive missionary movement, catalyzed by the collapse of the Cold War system and the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation. Korean churches and missionary organizations astutely responded to changes in international politics and internal North Korean dynamics by launching diverse missionary strategies, and in this process, various specific events played crucial roles in materializing the missionary boom.\n\nFirst, the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement was signed in 1991, and in the same year, a symposium was held in Los Angeles involving scholars from North and South Korean churches. In July, the Peaceful Unification Mission Christian Conference convened in Tokyo, Japan, and in October, the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace (ACRP) was held in Kathmandu, Nepal, thereby formally beginning religious exchanges between North and South. These international encounters did not merely symbolize reconciliation but decisively propelled the Korean church to embrace North Korean mission as a tangible task.\n\nAnother pivotal moment occurred with the North Korean famine (Arduous March) and the subsequent international emergency food aid request in 1995. North Korea officially acknowledged its food crisis in February 1995 and requested 300,000 tons of aid from international NGOs, later extending urgent requests to South Korea and Japan in May of the same year. As a result, Korean churches and Christian NGOs, both conservative and progressive, launched large-scale humanitarian assistance, promoting a new form of mission that combined \"gospel and bread.\" Heo Seong-eop noted that \"North Korean missions shifted toward a stage where humanitarian relief and gospel evangelism were integrated as dual strategies.\"\n\nDuring this period, churches and missionary organizations actively diversified their methods for North Korean missions. A particularly notable development was the diversification of missionary strategies and the institutionalization of the identity of 'North Korean missionary.' Notably, the Korean Christian Federation’s Unification Mission College established a specialized program for training North Korean missionaries from the mid-1990s. This program was open to youths, university students, seminarians, laypeople, and pastors, operating on a two-semester system combining theoretical education and field training. Classes were held weekly on Monday evenings, with correspondence courses offered to overcome regional limitations. Lecturers included professors from Seoul National University, former deputy ministers of unification, senior pastors, and think tank researchers, providing a comprehensive education covering politics, economy, society, culture, and mission strategies. Graduates were awarded 'Korean Christian Federation Certified North Korean Missionary' qualifications and were officially commissioned, marking \"a critical turning point in advancing North Korean mission from emotional zeal to systematic and institutionalized missionary movements.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the Cornerstone Mission Society operated a five-stage North Korean Missionary Training School based in border regions with North Korea. This program had detailed step-by-step goals:\n\nThe first stage involved preparing returnees to North Korea for gospel ministry. The second stage focused on intensive Bible education for North Korean defectors. The third stage trained selected leaders through underground seminary programs. The fourth stage supported those needing to settle in China with pastoral care and leadership development. The fifth stage assisted those who could neither return to North Korea nor settle in China in migrating to third countries. Through this system, the ministry established a unique and strategic model for training North Korean defectors as missionaries.\n\nThus, by the late 1990s, the term \"North Korean missionary\" had become more than a symbolic concept; it evolved into a tangible professional and missional identity, encompassing institutional training, organized commissioning, and denominational support systems. Since direct entry into North Korea was impossible, missionaries operated mainly in third countries (China, Russia, Mongolia, etc.), engaging in ministries such as evangelism among North Korean defectors, supporting underground churches near borders, broadcasting Christian radio programs into North Korea, and smuggling Bibles and evangelistic materials.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions existed between the evangelical and ecumenical camps. The evangelical side emphasized underground church work and direct evangelism through defectors, while the ecumenical side pursued peace and reconciliation missions through exchanges with the Korean Christian Federation (Jogeoryeon). For example, in 1995, the Korean National Council of Churches (KNCC) issued the \"Jubilee Declaration for National Unification,\" advocating autonomous unification of the Korean Peninsula, confession of church culpability, and active peace and unification movements. This sparked intense discussions within Korean churches regarding the relationship between reunification and North Korean missions.\n\nIn the late 1990s, North Korea’s Korean Christian Federation (Jogeoryeon) actively sought exchanges with South Korean churches and overseas Christian organizations, leading to the formalization of mission channels. Not only humanitarian support through the Korean Red Cross but also diverse contacts via private missionary organizations increased.\n\nUltimately, the surge of North Korean mission in the 1990s was not merely a fleeting emotional enthusiasm but rather a complex phenomenon driven by political shifts (Inter-Korean Basic Agreement, Kim Il-sung’s death, famine crisis), religious changes (partial relaxation of North Korea’s religious policies), missionary strategy evolution (indirect missions, third-country missions), and internal theological tensions and convergence within Korean Christianity. Heo Seong-eop emphasized that \"North Korean missions must not simply be driven by doctrinal zeal, but must emerge through theological reflection on historical contexts and a deep sense of national responsibility.\"\n\n\nImmigrant Mission\n\n\nImmigrant mission in Korea emerged as a new field of ministry in response to the increasing influx of foreign laborers and marriage migrants. Whereas Korean churches had previously concentrated on centrifugal mission—sending missionaries abroad—this period marked the beginning of centripetal mission, wherein foreigners within Korea became direct subjects of ministry. This shift was not merely strategic but demanded theological reflection on the church’s identity and the essence of mission within a multicultural society.\n\nThe migrant mission effort was prompted by the introduction of the foreign industrial trainee system in 1991, which brought a rapid increase in foreign laborers. These laborers often lacked legal protections and worked under poor conditions in 3D industries (dirty, difficult, and dangerous), facing linguistic, legal, and cultural barriers. By the mid-1990s, undocumented laborers far outnumbered legal workers; in 1994 alone, of the total 81,824 foreign laborers in Korea, 48,231—approximately 59%—were undocumented.\n\nChurches, especially those rooted in industrial mission, responded to this growing reality. Congregations in areas such as Guro, Ansan, and Incheon—industrial hubs—launched holistic ministries that provided shelter, medical assistance, legal aid, Korean language classes, and bilingual worship services. For instance, Seonbu First Church in Ansan and several churches in the Guro industrial zone opened shelters and partnered with pro bono medical teams and legal counselors to support undocumented workers. In Incheon, Hanmaeum Church began holding multilingual worship services in 1997 and worked to build an inclusive faith community for foreign workers.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK, Tonghap) played a leading institutional role in organizing these efforts. During the 1990s, the General Assembly’s Evangelism Department formally recognized migrant ministry as a central mission field and laid groundwork for multicultural ministry. Following a structural reorganization, the Domestic Mission Department took over and expanded efforts via ecumenical partnerships and global mission networks. Notably, from 1998, the PCK invited pastors from the Philippines, Nepal, and Bangladesh to serve as migrant ministry partners in Korea. These invited missionaries led ethnic-language worship services and provided pastoral care, language interpretation, and legal guidance.\n\nAround the same time, churches also began responding to the needs of marriage migrants and multicultural families. Many foreign women who entered Korea through international marriage experienced isolation, cultural conflict, and social discrimination. Churches offered Korean language classes, cultural adaptation programs, and family support ministries. For example, Onyang First Church in Asan launched free Korean classes and Bible instruction for Vietnamese wives in 1999. In Busan, a local church ran “Multicultural Bible Camps” to support parent–child bonding and identity formation.\n\nThrough these developments, migrant mission came to be understood not merely as an alternative mission strategy, but as mission in its own right. It offered a low-cost yet impactful way to expand God’s Kingdom among the nations living within Korea’s borders. Theologically, it called Korean churches to remember their own pilgrim identity: Christians, as described in the New Testament, are “sojourners and exiles” on this earth (παρεπίδημοι). Thus, welcoming migrants as co-citizens of the Kingdom of God became a core dimension of ecclesial faithfulness.\n\nNevertheless, not all church responses were ideal. Some large churches utilized migrant worship services primarily to expand church size or collect offerings, relegating migrant worship to off-hour slots or non-sanctuary spaces. Others continued to treat migrants as passive targets of evangelism, rather than full members of the body of Christ.\n\nDespite these limitations, the 1990s marked a critical turning point as Korean churches began to reckon with their responsibility within a multicultural society. The vision of “reverse mission”—where migrants received the gospel in Korea and returned to evangelize their home countries—also emerged during this period. Migrant mission in the 1990s thus not only opened new possibilities for mission strategy but prompted Korean churches to reevaluate their identity and global calling in the changing world.\n\n\nChanges in Korean Christian Civil Movements\n\n\nFrom the late 1980s, South Korean society underwent dramatic democratic transformations, and Korean Christianity, too, entered a new phase of social engagement. The June Struggle of 1987 broke open the authoritarian regime, resulting in constitutional reform and the introduction of direct presidential elections. In this context, Korean churches began to transition from the radical protest style of minjung (people's) movements toward more diverse and institutional modes of social involvement.\n\nUp until the mid-1980s, social participation by Korean churches largely aligned with the minjung movement, rooted in minjung theology and direct resistance to military dictatorship. However, in the late 1980s, the landscape of social activism began to change. As the authoritarian state weakened and civic spaces expanded, resistance-based movements gave way to civil movements seeking reform within the system. The thesis notes that during this period, “the era of minjung movements was declared to be over, and the era of civil movements was said to have arrived”.\n\nIt was in this historical shift that the Christian Ethics Movement of Korea (CEMK, or 기윤실) was founded in 1987. Led by respected Christian leaders such as Jang Gi-ryeo, Sohn Bong-ho, and Lee Man-yeol, CEMK emphasized ethical self-reflection and personal moral responsibility. The organization believed that “Christians must change society by first embodying moral integrity in their personal lives”. This vision differed from previous protest-based activism and aimed for reform through integrity, service, and public witness. It marked a significant redefinition of Christian civil activism in Korea. CEMK promoted values such as simplicity, honesty, rejection of corruption and bribery, ethical behavior in the workplace, and advocacy for the marginalized. In its guidelines, the group called on Christians to actively pursue economic justice, care for vulnerable populations, and fight against societal corruption. Their approach to civic engagement was intentionally apolitical yet committed to transformative public witness grounded in evangelical values. Meanwhile, from the late 1980s into the early 1990s, another stream of Christian activism emerged—institutional political participation. Unlike in the earlier dictatorship period, some Christian leaders now considered running for public office or engaging in policymaking. This shift sparked internal debate. Many feared that too much political involvement would compromise the church's spiritual integrity and damage the public perception of Christianity. The question was not merely whether to engage politics, but how to do so while remaining faithful to the Gospel.\n\nWhat defined this period, then, was a shift in both goals and methods. While earlier movements focused on resisting state repression, the post-1987 Christian civil movements began grappling with more complex, systemic issues: corruption, inequality, and social polarization. As the thesis argues, “as social movements shifted from resistance to institutional reform, Christian civil movements also began to explore new directions”.\n\nDespite democratization and the expansion of civil society, internal tensions persisted within Korean churches. Some conservative denominations remained skeptical of civil engagement, viewing it as a secular compromise. Yet the evangelical reformist stream, represented by groups like CEMK, continued to gain traction. This tension pushed Christian civil movements to mature, seeking not only moral clarity but also strategic effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, the period from the late 1980s to the 1990s marked a crucial transition in Korean Christian civil activism. It was characterized by(1) a shift from resistance-based minjung activism to civil reformism,(2) the rise of ethical civic engagement based on personal integrity,(3) increasing attempts at institutional political participation, and(4) internal struggles over the proper role of Christianity in public life.\n\nThis period can be understood as a time of strategic and theological reorientation, as the Korean church sought to embody its calling to be salt and light in a changing democratic society.\n\n\nTable. Changes in Korean Christian Civil Movements\n\n\n| Period | Social Context | Characteristics of Christian Civil Movements | Key Examples and Activities |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Late 1980s | Democratization process, decline of authoritarian regime, end of minjung movement | Shift from radical resistance to civil reform; emphasis on ethical witness and civic participation | Expansion of civic movements; Christian intellectuals' active participation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990s | Growth of institutional democracy and civil society | Rise of evangelical-based civic reform; focus on personal morality and structural reform without direct political affiliation | Founding of CEMK (1987); economic justice campaigns; protection of the vulnerable |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n“It is My Fault” (Nae Tasi-o 내 탓이오) Movement\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the “It Is My Fault” (Nae Tasi-o, 내 탓이오) movement launched by the Korean Catholic Church emerged as a movement of self-reflective social participation amidst the broader moral crisis and rising individualism in Korean society. This movement should not be understood as merely a religious slogan but as a serious response to the widespread social conflicts and collapse of ethics that followed democratization. Since the mid-1980s, South Korea had experienced growing regional divisions, labor disputes, and corruption scandals, during which a culture of shifting blame onto others became pervasive. It was within this context that the Catholic Lay Apostolate Council (평신도사도직협의회, hereafter referred to as the Lay Council) realized the urgent need to encourage individuals to take responsibility for the problems of society themselves.\n\nThe immediate inception of the \"It Is My Fault\" movement came in 1988 when the Lay Council proposed a \"Trust Restoration Campaign\" during the annual Catholic Laity Day. They selected the phrase \"It is my fault, my great fault\" from the traditional penitential prayer in the Catholic Mass to symbolize the attitude of personal accountability rather than blaming external forces. Initially, however, the campaign received little public attention. The decisive turning point occurred in 1989, when then-Archbishop Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan attached a \"It Is My Fault\" sticker to the rear window of his personal car. Cardinal Kim declared, \"Only when we reflect on ourselves first can we find solutions,\" thus awakening the national consciousness toward the need for humility and self-reflection.\n\nFollowing this event, the campaign spread rapidly across the nation. The Lay Council produced more than 300,000 \"It Is My Fault\" car stickers, distributing them throughout churches and public venues, and by the early 1990s, vehicles bearing the sticker became a common sight in the streets of South Korea. The public resonated deeply with the message encapsulated in this single phrase, and what began as a religious initiative soon evolved into a broader social movement. Catholic parishes and dioceses encouraged not only the distribution of stickers but also incorporated the spirit of the campaign into homilies and catechetical education, urging believers to examine their own faults first in daily life. The movement’s goal extended beyond verbal affirmation, seeking to establish a culture of ethical living in personal relationships, workplaces, and broader society.\n\nThe key agents of this movement were the Catholic Lay Council and the Catholic Church leadership, most notably Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan. Cardinal Kim did not stop at symbolic participation; he consistently emphasized the spirit of \"It Is My Fault\" in his sermons, public lectures, and media interviews. His exemplary leadership gave the movement significant public credibility, prompting many non-Catholics to take notice. The media praised it as \"an invitation for the whole society to reflect and repent.\" At that time, religious leaders still retained considerable social trust, which further amplified the campaign’s influence.\n\nThe significance of the \"It Is My Fault\" movement can be evaluated on three levels. First, on a personal level, it fostered a culture of self-examination, countering the prevailing blame-shifting tendencies of Korean society. Second, at the communal level, it served as a starting point for the restoration of social trust, encouraging individuals to take responsibility within their families, workplaces, and communities. Third, on a societal level, it set an ethical standard, calling leaders across political and business sectors to self-reflection and accountability. Cardinal Kim, among others, consistently urged public figures to embody the \"It Is My Fault\" spirit.\n\nNevertheless, the movement also had clear limitations. Critics pointed out that emphasizing individual guilt without addressing structural injustices could deflect from the need for systemic reform. Some warned that \"excessively personalizing all blame risks obscuring the real perpetrators and structural problems of society.\" Over time, the movement gradually lost momentum, becoming reduced to a symbolic gesture by the mid-1990s. Despite this, its initial impact was profound: it challenged the complacent blame culture and elevated the value of personal conscience and humility within public discourse.\n\nUltimately, the \"It Is My Fault\" movement remains an important example of ethical social participation initiated by the Korean Catholic Church. Though it did not result in lasting institutional reforms, it significantly contributed to shaping a moral discourse centered on responsibility, conscience, and communal trust during a period of societal turbulence. Even decades later, references to the \"It Is My Fault\" spirit reemerged during national tragedies such as the Sewol Ferry Disaster, indicating that its symbolic significance remains potent today.\n\n\nCatholic and Protestant Minjung Movement\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the Korean Christian Minjung (people’s) movement encountered a major turning point. For Protestant Minjung churches, the era marked a shift from street-based, resistance-centered activism rooted in the 1970s–80s industrial mission tradition toward a more localized, community-oriented model. This was largely due to changing national conditions: the transition to democracy after 1987, the diffusion of social movements into the NGO sector, and the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (IMF crisis), which created deep, structural poverty. These factors redefined the \"people\" (minjung) not simply as laborers or urban poor, but now also as irregular workers, the homeless, migrant laborers, runaway youth, and the elderly poor. The church had to develop new modes of presence, accompaniment, and solidarity amid these evolving conditions.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Korea’s Christian poverty ministries were shaped by both theological reflection and new social demands. The Minjung churches inherited the legacy of the industrial mission and liberation theology, but began to evolve toward community-based models that sought long-term empowerment. One scholar notes that “by the 1990s, Minjung churches increasingly focused on job creation and welfare expansion through self-reliance support centers, rather than simply proclaiming liberation theology.” A representative example is Reverend Heo Byeong-seop’s Dongwol Church, which in 1990 founded the Wolsandong Construction Workers’ Cooperative to directly address the livelihood crisis of day laborers.\n\nAlongside this shift, Korean Christian poverty work began to intersect with the social economy movement. Scholars observe that “by the late 1990s, Christian sectors initiated a wide range of social economy experiments—including self-reliant enterprises, credit unions, and local currency programs—built on the legacy of Minjung theology and industrial mission.” These efforts were led by both Minjung churches and institutions like Sungkonghoe University. The aim was not only welfare provision but also structural alternatives to neoliberal austerity.\n\nKey community-based examples during this period include Dail Community (founded in 1988), Bapsang Community (1998), the Ansan Migrant Center (starting in 1994 as a foreign labor counseling center), the study-room movement (begun in 1984 and rapidly expanded in the 1990s), and St. Francis College (established in 2005). These movements strove to build “viable and alternative communities for the urban poor, including the homeless, single elders, migrant workers, and children in poverty.” Among them, Pastor Heo Ki-bok’s Bapsang Community developed what he called “creative welfare,” integrating daily meals, employment initiatives, and holistic self-reliance for the homeless as active subjects of change.\n\nThis trajectory should not be mistaken as a retreat from mission into charity. Rather, it reflects an intentional theological response to the structural violence of the market economy. Professor Cho Yong-hoon explains: “Mission among the poor is not merely about saving souls, but about restoring their humanity and agency. The poor are not only objects of mission but the agents of it.” In this view, Christian poverty work is a form of holistic mission grounded in missio Dei—the belief that God is already at work in the world’s pain, calling the church to participate in healing and justice. \n\nFor Protestant Minjung churches, this meant building new church forms—alternative worship spaces, communal economies, and hybrid organizations operating as both church and neighborhood center. It also required critical self-reflection, as aging congregations and the dispersal of the old Minjung movement led to internal doubts about identity and sustainability. Still, many continued to pursue grassroots pastoral care, local organizing, and new modes of public theology. Meanwhile, the Catholic Minjung-oriented movement evolved along a parallel but distinct path. Without formally establishing separate “Minjung churches,” the Catholic Church institutionalized its people-centered mission through structured ministries—such as the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice, labor pastoral centers, rural dioceses like Wonju, and welfare communities operated by religious orders. The iconic example of this is the House of Sharing, a healing and solidarity community for survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery. While not a parish, the community functions as a space where the wounds of history are remembered and God’s justice is embodied. Other initiatives included free meal services, shelters for migrant workers and runaway teens, and legal aid for the evicted.\n\nWhat unites both traditions—Protestant and Catholic—is their evolving interpretation of missio Dei. For Protestant theology, missio Dei reframed the church not as a missionary sender, but as a witness-participant in God’s ongoing work in the world. For Catholic theology, especially after Vatican II and Redemptoris Missio, the church’s mission was recast in trinitarian terms as participation in the loving, sending movement of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Both traditions thus emphasized that mission must take place where God is suffering—in the concrete lives of the poor, the excluded, and the displaced.\n\nIn summary, the Minjung mission in 1990s Korea cannot be reduced to either a continuation of liberation theology or a collapse into welfare services. It was an effort, on both Protestant and Catholic sides, to re-ground the meaning of Christian mission in the context of structural injustice, urban poverty, and neoliberal crisis. This movement laid the theological and organizational foundation for subsequent developments in Korea’s Christian engagement with social economy, ecological justice, and post-colonial reconciliation.\n\n\nTable.

This movement—built on Minjung theology, liberation theology, and missio Dei—interpreted Jesus’ gospel as unfolding not above but among the oppressed, and called for communities that embodied this incarnational vision. As the 1990s introduced new socioeconomic crises, including the 1997 IMF financial collapse, poverty became increasingly multilayered. The Minjung Church tradition responded by forming grassroots Christian communities that sought not merely to alleviate poverty, but to stand in solidarity with “the new Minjung”—homeless persons, migrant laborers, the working poor, and neglected children.\n\nThese Christian communities evolved from the legacy of earlier industrial missions and Minjung churches, such as those in the Guro district in the 1980s. During the 1990s, these churches increasingly separated from mainline denominational institutions and instead positioned themselves as independent communities rooted in the everyday lives of the poor. Their mission was not church growth, but the liberation and empowerment of oppressed people through deep engagement in labor activism, welfare organizing, and urban justice campaigns. However, in the wake of the IMF crisis, many of these churches encountered significant hardship. Membership declined, financial support dwindled, and internal tensions emerged over identity and strategy. In response, some Minjung churches began collaborating with NGOs and self-reliance centers, adopting social welfare approaches grounded in principles of participation and structural reform rather than charity alone.\n\nAmong the most prominent examples of this evolving movement were the Dure Community and the Dail Community. Both initiatives redefined what it meant to be a “church” in the neoliberal city: they rejected hierarchical institutional structures and instead built egalitarian, shared-living communities in urban poverty zones.\n\nThe Dure Community, founded in Neunggok-dong in Goyang City, established a lifestyle-based faith community among urban poor populations—unemployed persons, disabled people, day laborers, and elderly citizens. The community emphasized collective labor, shared meals, communal child-rearing, and mutual care as expressions of the gospel. Worship was not held in a building but enacted through daily life. Theologically, Dure was rooted in the Minjung understanding of the Kingdom of God as a communal restoration of justice and dignity. Their practice was built not around Sunday worship but around “living the gospel” through a just economic and social order\n\nIn contrast, the Dail Community emerged in 1988 when Rev. Il-do Choi began offering free meals to homeless persons near Cheongnyangni Station in Seoul. From this act of service grew a network of faith-based welfare institutions—soup kitchens, homeless shelters, rehabilitation centers, community libraries, and children's study rooms. Dail's philosophy rested on a simple but radical idea: “The gospel is a bowl of rice.” Eucharist was reinterpreted as a shared meal with the poor, and salvation was understood as communal healing and reconciliation through presence. Rather than seek converts or grow the church institutionally, Dail sought to “become bread” to its neighbors.\n\nBoth communities expanded the boundaries of the Minjung Church movement. They were living enactments of missio Dei, not in institutional or evangelical terms, but as the embodied presence of God's love in the suffering of the world. Their ministry was grounded in the conviction that “God’s Kingdom is realized in the suffering of the Minjung,” and that to serve, live with, and love the Minjung is to live out the gospel.\n\nThese experiments also demonstrated a willingness to reformulate Christian witness in the face of the growing secularization and privatization of religion. As institutional megachurches increasingly prioritized individual salvation, material prosperity, and political conservatism, Dure and Dail offered alternative forms of public faith—a Christianity that restored the communal, incarnational, and prophetic dimensions of the gospel. They rejected the consumerism and clericalism that had overtaken Korean Protestantism and instead reaffirmed that “the church is not a building but a community of shared suffering.”\n\nThe significance of these communities can be summarized in four points. First, they developed Christian responses to new forms of urban poverty—homelessness, unemployment, precarious labor, and social exclusion. Second, they embodied a model of social mission that integrated welfare and spirituality. Third, they acknowledged internal critiques—such as the charge of becoming “Minjung-less Minjung Churches”—and sought new ways to restore participation and solidarity. Finally, they provided a living answer to the theological question of what the church must be in an age of neoliberalism and spiritual crisis.\n\nToday, these community movements remain vital reminders that the church’s mission is not primarily to grow in number, but to embody the gospel where suffering is most acute. The Minjung Church Movement, in its transformation through communities like Dure and Dail, continues to pose the question: Whose side is the church on?\n\n\n\n(1) The Anti-Opium Movement (1877) (Huang Zhiqi 2004: 38-45; Ye Chenming 2014: 303-304)  \n\n\nAfter the Opium Wars, opium flooded the Chinese market, causing widespread social harm. Many missionaries in China advocated for anti-opium campaigns, including F. S. Turner of the London Missionary Society (LMS), who served in Hong Kong and Guangdong. After returning to England in 1870, Turner became deeply involved in the anti-opium movement. In 1874, he joined the Anglo-Oriental Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade as its Executive Secretary. Turner also coordinated with Chinese Christians, leading to the establishment of the Canton Anti-Opium Society at the Canton Pok Tsai Hospital in 1875, calling on believers to join the cause.  \n\n\nIn Hong Kong, Lutheran pastor Wong Yuk Cho was particularly active in the anti-opium movement. Together with To Tsai Church’s Au Fung Chi, he co-founded the Hong Kong Anti-Opium Society, supporting counterparts in Guangzhou. He also published articles promoting the cause in The Global Times.  \n\n\nIn 1877, over a dozen Hong Kong notables petitioned Zuo Zongtang, China’s special envoy to Britain, urging him to highlight the severity of the opium problem in Britain. They emphasized the role of British merchants in the opium trade as a key issue. The petition had 25 signatories, including prominent figures such as Wen Qingxi (LMS), Wong Tzu-chuen (Wong Tao, LMS), Wong Yuk Cho (Lutheran), and others from the Anglican Church, Basel Mission, and LMS. Zuo Zongtang responded positively.  \n\n\nThe anti-opium movement in Hong Kong demonstrated the concern and activism of local Chinese pastors and believers regarding China’s opium problem.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(2) Chinese Christian Cemeteries (Xing Fuzeng 2012: 11-13; 78-98)  \n\n\nSince Hong Kong's establishment, the government set up a Protestant Cemetery in Happy Valley in 1845, but it was designated exclusively for European and American burials. In the 1850s, a cemetery was also established for Chinese, but conflicts arose between the Buddhist and Taoist burial rituals and Christian beliefs, creating challenges for burying Chinese Christians.  \n\n\nIn 1858, following advocacy by missionaries from the LMS, Anglican Church, and Basel Mission, the first Chinese Christian cemetery was established in the western district of Hong Kong Island (Sheung Wan and Taipingshan). In the 1880s, due to urban development, the government decided to reclaim the land and in 1882 granted a 43-acre plot in Pokfulam specifically for Chinese Christian burials. Missionaries from the three aforementioned societies served as trustees, but the cemetery's management was entrusted to Chinese pastors and representatives. In 1909, the land was officially leased by the government, and after the formation of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union in 1915, the cemetery came under its management.  \n\n\nAs Christianity expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula, Chinese pastors such as Kwong Yat-sau petitioned the government in 1903, noting the lack of burial grounds for Kowloon Christians. With the support of Bishop Joseph Hoare of the Diocese of Victoria, the government granted a 10-acre plot in Kowloon City in 1904 for a Chinese Christian cemetery. Over time, this cemetery expanded, becoming the second major burial site for Chinese Christians in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nBoth the Hong Kong and Kowloon Chinese Christian cemeteries feature stone tablets erected in 1920 inscribed with “Cemetery Rules.” These rules strictly prohibited traditional Chinese customs, such as burning incense or paper offerings, using compasses to determine grave orientation, performing kowtows at graves, or offering sacrifices. These prohibitions reflected the tension between traditional Chinese culture and Christian practices in burial rituals.  \n\n(1) 反鴉片運動（1877）（黃智奇2004：38-45；葉琛銘2014：303-304）\n\n\n鴉片戰爭後，鴉片煙充斥中國市場，流毒社會。不少在華傳教士推動禁煙運動，其中倫敦傳道會傳教士丹拿（F. S. Turner），曾派駐香港及廣東，於1870年回英國後，投入禁煙運動。1874年，加社「英東反鴉片會」（Anglo-oriental Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade），並任執行秘書。他又跟華人信徒聯絡，促成1875年在廣州博濟醫院成立了「羊城勸戒鴉片社」，呼籲各地信徒響應。香港禮賢會牧師王煜初在禁煙問題上，可說不遺餘力。他聯同道濟會堂的區鳳墀在港成立「勸戒鴉片會社」，聲援廣州同道。此外，又於《萬國公報》撰文，推廣禁煙。\n\n\n1877年，十多名香港紳士上書中國駐英欽差大臣左忠棠，希望他能在英國朝野中，反映中國煙禍問題的嚴重，特別是英國煙商販賣鴉片活動，在在成為問題的關鍵。上書者包括廿五人：溫清溪（倫敦會）、王紫詮（王韜，倫敦會）、王煜初（禮賢會）、龐護蓮、何玉泉（倫敦會）、陳悅？、阮英舫（倫敦會）、何槐卿、李正高（巴色會）、鄭中岳、羅深源（聖公會）、何耀榮、鄺日修（聖公會）、麥光榮、周榮之、余翰中、邱靜生、吳袒文、黃悅臣、黃銳生、莫惠錦、藍恩祿、黃信達、陳光理、游誠一。其中可查的香港牧師及信徒有八年，涉及倫敦會、禮賢會、巴色會及聖公會。對此，左忠棠亦作積極回應。從香港反禁煙運動可見，當時香港華人牧者及信徒，對中國禁煙問題的關注與行動。\n\n\n(2) 華人基督教墳場（邢福增2012：11-13；78-98）\n\n\n香港開埠以來，政府於1845年於跑馬地設新教墳場（Protestant Cemetery），但此墳場只供安葬歐美人士。1850年代，政府亦設華人墳場，但由於華人殯葬過程中涉及的佛道儀式與基督教信仰間的矛盾，故華人基督徒死後的安葬問題，成為傳教士的關注。1858年，在倫敦傳道會、聖公會及巴色傳道會的傳教士爭取下，首個華人基督徒墓地在香港島西區（上環、太平山區）設立。1880年代，政府因應城市發展需要，決定收回華人基督教墓地地段，乃於1882年批出薄扶林43英畝地段，設立專供華人基督徒安葬的墳場。墳場由上述三個差會傳教士任信託人（trustee），但管理則交由華人牧者及代表負責。1909年，政府轉以租契（lease）方式批出地段。1915年，香港中華基督教聯會成立後，墳場歸聯會管理。\n\n\n隨著基督教在九龍半島的發展，1903年，由鄺日修等華人牧者上書政府，表示九龍信徒苦無墳地。有關申請獲維多利亞教區霍約瑟主教的支持，結果1904年政府批出九龍城近10英畝土地，作為華人基督教墳場。其後，九龍墳場有所擴展，成為香港第二個主要的華人基督教徒墳。\n\n\n香港及九龍兩個華人基督教墳場，均有1920年所立碑石，刻有「墳場規則」，規定「必須去除一切俗例」：「不得焚燒香紙燭及串炮」、「不得以羅經定墳穴方向及修月形」、「不得向墳墓行跪拜禮」、「不得以禮物與墳墓獻祭」等，反映出中國傳統文化與基督教信仰在死亡儀式上的張力。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Ma Ying-Biu and the Founding of Sincere Department Store, 1900\n\n(Lee Chi-Kwong 2006: 13-30; Wong Kin-Fai 2015)\n\nMa Ying-Biu (1864–1944), born in Xiangshan, Guangdong, in 1864, worked as a miner in Australia before founding the Wing Sang Company in Sydney. In 1894, he was baptized at the Sydney Chinese Presbyterian Church and later moved to Hong Kong, where he married Ho Hing-Tong, the second daughter of Anglican pastor Ho Ching-Shan. He also established Wing Cheong Gold Mountain Firm. In Hong Kong, Ma participated in the Anglican Church and was a founding member of the Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong. In 1900, he established Sincere Company, the first Western-style department store in Hong Kong, located on Queen’s Road. Ma emphasized \"business as a means of spreading the gospel.\" He passed away in Hong Kong in 1944.\n\nThe initial shareholders of Sincere Company included 13 overseas Chinese merchants from Australia, the Americas, and Xiangshan, many of whom were members of the To Tsai Church or the Chinese Congregational Church and also served as directors of the Chinese YMCA. The company established the Moral Education Department (1907), Intellectual Education Department (1911), and Hui Ai Society (1922). The Moral Education Department aimed to cultivate employees’ ethics and spread Christian teachings. The Intellectual Education Department offered evening classes to train business talent, while the Hui Ai Society collected donations from staff to fund charitable activities.\n\nAs a devout Christian, Ma ensured that Sincere Department Store closed on Sundays to allow employees to attend church services. The store set a precedent for the modern department store industry, earning Ma the title \"Father of Chinese Department Stores.\" Sincere was followed by the establishment of other major stores in Hong Kong, including True Light Department Store, Wing On Department Store (1907, founded by Kwok Chuen of the Chinese Congregational Church), and The Sun Company (1911, founded by Choi Cheong and Choi Hing of the Hop Yat Church). These \"Four Major Stores\" were all operated by Christian businessmen returning from Australia and America.\n\nFrom December 1922 to January 1923, during John Mott’s visit to Hong Kong, the Four Stores’ managers hosted a banquet at the Hongkong Hotel for Mott and local church leaders (Wah Tsz Yat Po, 1923).\n\n\n(2) John R. Mott’s Evangelistic Visit to Hong Kong, 1901\n\n(Yip Cham-Ming 2014: 88)\n\nJohn R. Mott (1865–1955), General Secretary of the World Student Christian Federation (W.S.C.F.), was a long-time leader of the YMCA and the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. During his 1901 visit to China, Mott spent two days in Hong Kong. Local Chinese churches organized two large-scale youth-focused evangelistic meetings.\n\nThe first meeting was held at Queen’s College, attracting around 400 to 500 attendees. Since the colonial government prohibited religious activities in government schools, follow-up counseling sessions were held at To Tsai Church, resulting in eight young people converting to Christianity. The second meeting drew 600 to 700 attendees, with 57 conversions. This marked the first large-scale gospel movement in Hong Kong.\n\n\n(3) Joint Publication of The Chinese Christian Monthly, 1908\n\n(Hing Fook-Tsang 2014b: 229-230)\n\nPublished in 1908, The Chinese Christian Monthly was a collaborative effort by three German missionary societies: the Basel Mission, the Rhenish Mission (Barmen), and the Berlin Mission. Edited by I. Genahr, a missionary of the Hong Kong Rhenish Church, the journal was produced at the Rhenish Mission office in Hong Kong and published twice a month.\n\nThe journal’s mission statement emphasized fostering unity among the three societies, likening their cooperation to \"a connecting cord gradually bringing harmony.\" Content included theological discussions, church news, biographies, novels, and general reports. Most contributors were Chinese pastors affiliated with the three societies, such as Mak Mui-Sang, Wong Yuen-Shum, and Cheung Sing-Wah.\n\nThe Basel and Rhenish Missions were active in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, with strong denominational ties reflected in the journal’s content. However, from July 1908, the journal expanded its reach by involving other denominations, such as the Wesleyan Church (represented by Chan Chuk-Nam) and To Tsai Church (represented by Cheung Chuk-Ling).\n\nDespite these efforts, The Chinese Christian Monthly ceased publication at the end of 1911 after four years. Subscription numbers had declined from a peak of 1,200 to fewer than 1,000, and editor Genahr planned to return to Germany in the spring of 1912, leaving no successor to continue the work.\n\n\n(1) 基督徒馬應彪創辨先施百貨公司 1900（李志剛2006：13-30；黃建輝2015）\n\n\n馬應彪（1864–1944），廣東香山人，1864年出生，後遠赴澳洲當礦工謀生，又在悉尼創立永生公司。1894年於雪梨華人長老會受洗，同年來港，與聖公會霍靜山牧師二女霍慶棠結婚，並創立永昌金山莊。馬在香港參加聖公會，並為香港中華基督教青年會創會會員。1900年在皇后大道創辦先施公司，是香港首間西式百貨公司，重視「藉商傳道」。1944年在港病逝。\n\n\n先施公司首批集資股東包括澳洲、美洲華僑及香山商人合共13人，其中多人均為道濟會堂或美華自理會信徒，亦兼任中華基督教青年會董事。因此，公司先後設德育部（1907）、智育部（1911）、惠愛會（1922）。德育部「以裁培同人道德為宗旨，並以闡揚基督真理，指引同人向道為依歸」。智育部則開設夜學，培養商業人才。至於惠愛會，則由公取同人捐款作基金，以利息作為慈善之用。由於馬應彪是基督徒，故先施百貨在禮拜日休業一天，讓員工可以到教會參加主日崇拜。\n\n\n先施公司的成立，開近代百貨業之先河，馬應彪也有「中國百貨商業之父」之譽。此後，真光百貨公司、永安百貨公司（1907，郭泉〔美華自理會〕創辦）及大新百貨公司（1911，蔡昌、蔡興〔合一堂〕創辦）先後在香港開設，均由澳美歸僑基督徒商人營辦，稱「四大公司」。1922年12月至1923年1月初，艾迪來港演講，期間四大公司司理董事等人，曾於大東酒店宴請艾迪及香港教會領袖（華字日報1923）。\n\n\n(2) 穆德訪港佈道1901（葉琛銘2014：88）\n\n\n穆德（John R. Mott，1865-1955）是世界基督徒學生聯盟（World Student Christian Federation，W.S.C.F.）總幹事、長期領導基督教青年會（Y.M.C.A.）和學生志願宣教運動（Student Volunteer Movement）。1901年藉訪問中國之便，抽出兩天時間訪問香港。香港華人教會為穆德安排兩場大型演講，對象是年青人。第一場在皇仁書院舉行，約有400至500人參與。由於港府禁止在政府學校進行宗教活動，因此大會商借道濟會堂進行陪談聚會，八位年青人歸信。另一場演講則有600至700人參與，其中57名年青人皈信。這是香港首次舉辦大型的福音運動。\n\n\n(3) 三巴會聯合出版《德華朔望報》1908（邢福增2014b：229-230）\n\n\n《德華朔望報》於1908年創刊，是一份由三個德國背景的差會（巴色會、禮賢會〔巴冕〕及巴陵會）合作出版的報刊，由香港禮賢會傳教士葉道勝（I. Genahr）負責主編，並以香港禮賢會為編輯所，每月出版兩冊。〈本報宗旨〉指出，該報的出版，主要希望「使三會有如聯絡之善帶，帶能漸合為一耳」，使「三會之人，知會名雖相異，而心則相印」。在內容方面，除經義的闡釋外，又有教務、小說、傳記、教會新聞等。撰稿者方面，大多為三會的華人教牧（如麥梅生、王元深、張聲和等）。\n\n\n巴色會、禮賢會及巴陵會均屬來華信義宗差會，並以廣東省為宣教區，其中巴色會及禮賢會均在香港傳教。故此，內容方面除一般教會及教義問題討論外，有較強烈的宗派色彩，對了解三會在華南地區的發展，裨益其大。不過，雖然該報有較強的宗派形象，但自1908年7月起，得到香港惠斯禮會陳祝南任代理人，數月後，再增加道濟會堂的張祝齡。從惠斯禮會堂及倫敦會道濟會堂願意擔任代理人可見，反映出該報雖仍具宗派形象，但又希望開拓宗派外的讀者。\n\n\n不過，1911年12月底，《德華朔望報》在出版四年後宣告停刊。究其原因，除訂閱數目從高峰期的1200份降至不足千份外，更重要的是主編葉道勝將於1912年春回國，「接理無人，不得己停辦耳」。\n\n(1) The Hair-Cutting but Clothing-Preserving Movement, 1910  \n\nReferences: Zhou Jiayong (2016: 84-101)  \n\n\nIn 1910, the \"Hair-Cutting but Clothing-Preserving Movement\" emerged in Hong Kong, primarily advocated by Chinese Christians. On October 2, members of the To Tsai Church, including Ho Lok-kam, Li Yuk-tong, Wong Hin-tong, and Tam Kau-ng, founded the \"Chinese Clothing and Haircutting Association.\" In November, Kwan King Leung, also from the To Tsai Church, initiated the \"Hair-Cutting but Clothing-Preserving Association,\" which held an inauguration ceremony attended by the prominent “Six Elders of Victoria Harbour.” Five of the six elders were affiliated with churches, representing the London Missionary Society, Rhenish Mission, and Congregational Church.  \n\n\nThe movement’s manifesto emphasized the symbolic significance of retaining traditional Chinese attire while cutting off queues, which represented Qing rule. This movement carried strong anti-Qing sentiment and resonated with broader reformist trends in China, where cutting queues and adopting Western clothing were seen as signs of modernization. The movement gained widespread support across various sectors, including business, education, and labor, spreading to cities like Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, and Macau.  \n\n\nWhile preserving traditional clothing suggested a tendency to maintain heritage, cutting queues symbolized a rejection of Qing rule and aligned with the reformist agenda. This movement illustrated the active role of Hong Kong’s Christian elite in advocating societal reform within a colonial context.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(2) Founding of The Great Light Daily, 1913  \n\nReferences: Ying Fuk-Tsang (2014c: 235-237); Liu Shaolin (2003: 198-201)  \n\n\nOn February 8, 1913, The Great Light Daily was established, becoming the first Christian-backed daily newspaper in modern China. Its creation was closely tied to Dr. Yan Wen-kai, a member of the To Tsai Church, who envisioned a Christian daily that would serve as a moral and social guide. Yan emphasized the importance of newspapers in shaping public opinion and contributing to social development. Inspired by the role of the press in revolutionary movements, he proposed the paper as a medium for promoting justice, equality, and virtue through Christian principles.  \n\n\nYan’s proposal received support from prominent church members, including Au Fung-chee, Cheung Chuk-ling, Mak Mui-sang, and Wong Kwok-shuen. Funds were raised by forming a limited company with 6,000 shares priced at HKD 5 each. The newspaper’s name, The Great Light Daily, was inspired by Jesus’ declaration: “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12), symbolizing the church’s mission to guide the nation’s progress.  \n\n\nSun Yat-sen, learning of the initiative, purchased shares and inscribed the phrase “Together with the Nation’s Spring” to encourage the newspaper’s role in strengthening the Republic. In 1920, he contributed an inscription to commemorate the paper’s anniversary.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(3) George S. Eddy’s Hong Kong Evangelism, 1914  \n\nReferences: Dai Weiliang (1915: 124-125); Ye Channing (2014: 89); Ying Fuk-Tsang (2006: 85-86)  \n\n\nGeorge S. Eddy, who served as the East Asia Secretary of the North American YMCA, conducted nine missionary tours to China between 1907 and 1934. His 1914 visit included stops in 12 cities, including Hong Kong, where he preached on November 8 and 9 at the New Theatre in Kau U Fong. His topics, “True Patriotism” and “The Causes and Consequences of National Decline,” drew large crowds, requiring multiple sessions to accommodate attendees. Nearly 4,000 people attended each night, with close to 1,000 expressing interest in Christianity.  \n\n\nEddy’s success was attributed to his deep understanding of China’s political and social context, delivering messages that resonated with intellectuals and youth. He framed Christianity as a solution to national salvation, combining faith with patriotism in a rational and compelling manner.  \n\n\nThe Hong Kong campaign was organized by the YMCA and Chinese churches, marking a milestone in interchurch cooperation. Preparations included scientific lectures to attract young people and pre-evangelism prayer meetings. Eddy’s visit also spurred the formation of the Hong Kong Christian Churches Union in 1915.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(4) Christian Weeklies Tan Tin (1916) and The Great Light Weekly (1917)  \n\nReferences: Ying Fuk-Tsang (2014c: 237-238)  \n\n\nIn the 1910s, two Christian weeklies were launched in Hong Kong, both associated with Zhang Yijing. In 1916, Zhang and Yan Wen-kai founded Tan Tin Weekly, which was published by The Great Light Daily every Sunday. In its manifesto, the weekly emphasized inclusivity, integrating insights from Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, and Western philosophy alongside Christianity.  \n\n\nFollowing Tan Tin, Zhang established The Great Light Weekly in 1917, aimed at promoting Christian values and addressing social and spiritual needs. Its content focused solely on religion, avoiding general news, mundane church events, and secular political commentary. Zhang’s editorial vision emphasized spreading “the great light” of the gospel to bring enlightenment to those in darkness.  \n\n\nIn 1918, Zhang left Hong Kong to resume his role at The True Light Daily in Shantou. Without its chief editor, The Great Light Weekly ceased publication the same year.  \n\n(1)剪髮不易服運動 1910（周佳榮2016：84-101）\n\n\n1910年香港民間出現剪髮不易服運動，其倡議者大多為華人基督徒。10月2日香港道濟會堂會友何樂琴、李煜堂、黃衍堂、譚教五等人成立「華服剪髮會」。11月，同屬道濟會堂的關景良（心焉）又發起「剪髮不易服會」，在成立禮上，著名的「香江六老」亦有出席見證。「六老」之中，除胡禮垣外，關元昌、王元深、吳秋湘、溫清溪、區鳳墀等五人全是教會的（倫敦會、禮賢會、公理會）元老。剪髮不易服宣言中，強調「剪髮不易服乃無形之振興民族亡而復強之先聲」，其保留中華服裝，但要剪掉象徵滿清統治的辮子，具有強烈的反清色彩。剪髮不易服運動發起後，得到民間不同界別（包括商界、學界及工人）的響應支持，可說成為一個全民運動，甚至影響省城、香山、佛山及澳門，亦有加入。毋庸置疑，雖然「不易服」有保持傳統之傾向，但剪髮（辮）本身卻具有濃烈否定滿清統治的政治含義。這也跟甲午後中國社會掀起旨在通過剪剃髮辮、改易西服來推動變革圖強的潮流，有其符合之處。這也從側面說明，香港基督徒社會菁英在殖民地推動中國社會變革方面的實踐。\n\n\n(2) 近代中國首張基督教背景的日報──《大光報》創刊1913（邢福增2014c：235-237；劉紹麟2003：198-201）\n\n\n1913年2月8日創辦的《大光日報》，更成為近代中國首張具基督教背景的日報。《大光日報》的誕生，跟道濟會堂教友尹文楷醫生有密切的關係。據尹氏指出，他在1912年6月22日在香港召集一次會議，向與會者表達了籌備基督教日報的宏願與意義。他強調報紙是大眾耳目，對社會的發展起了重大的作用。在清末的革命運動中，報章在籲譽論上起的作用，已是有目共睹。後來他又憶述：「民國建元，某有鑑於報紙轉移人心偉大之力，亟思籌辦日報，為教會喉舌，藉此以盡忠善導之職」。他對基督教報紙的期望是：「這報紙旨在回應政治及社會宣傳的訴求，為改正及引導公義、平等，及以全善作導引而立。」尹氏的倡導，得到區鳳墀、張祝齡、麥梅生、王國璇、馬永燦等教會人士響應。眾人商討了報紙的內容，並且提出籌組有限公司，以公開認股方法來籌集資金，目標為三萬元，每股5元，合共6000股。報紙命名為《大光日報》，取自耶穌基督的自述：「我是世界的光。跟從我的，就不在黑暗裏走，必要得着生命的光」（約8:12），寓意教會的靈光會引領國家的發展。\n\n\n1912年，孫中山得悉尹文楷等正籌辦《大光日報》，也曾認股，並題贈「與國同春」四個大字，勉勵它為民主共和國的鞏固和發展而大造革命輿論。1920年，《大光報》出版年刊，孫中山又為其題詞。\n\n\n(3) 艾迪香港佈道1914（戴偉良1915：124-125；葉琛銘2014：89；邢福增2006：85-86）\n\n\n艾迪（George S. Eddy）自1911年出任北美基督教青年會東亞巡迴幹事，先後九次（1907、1910、1913、1914、1918、1922、1929、1931、1934）來華佈道。1914年9月至12月間，他在天津、北京、保定、長沙、武昌、蘇州、杭州、福州、香港、廣州、上海及南京等12個城市巡迴佈道。其中香港場次合共兩天：11月8日，他在香港九如坊新戲院演講，題為「愛國真主義」，由尹文楷傳譯，聽者人數擁擠，會場不能容納，要分三場演講。11月9日晚，以「國家敗亡之因果」為題，由梁筱瑳傳譯。演講前半小時已座無虛席，門外仍有近千人等候，於是再分場演講。是次香港佈道，赴會者每晚有近4000人，有近千人慕道。\n\n\n曾任廣州青年會總幹事的梁小初憶述，艾迪在華傳道之收效，主要因為其對中國時局有頗為清楚的認識，故能對症下藥，語多中肯；且其講道，不像一般佈道家慣用的武斷及反理智之辭。因而很受知識分子的接受，甚至皈依。王治心亦謂，艾迪每次演講，都是先把中國情形詳加分析，再歸結於耶穌道理與國家關係，因而很受青年學生的歡迎。可見，將信仰結合救國，並以較理性的方式表達，正是艾迪受到空前歡迎的原因。這亦反映二十世紀中國的處境：救國問題成為普遍知識分子、青年學生的關懷。\n\n\n是次艾迪來港佈道，由香港青年會及華人教會聯合邀請及籌備。為鼓勵慕道者赴會，籌委會指派香港青年會先籌辦一個科學講座，吸引年青人出席。然後在會上派發佈道會的門券，邀請與會者參與佈道會。另一方面，籌委會亦於佈道會前一個月，發動各堂會會友邀請未信者參加各堂舉辦的祈禱會及查經班，作為佈道會的預工。因籌備是次佈道會關係，促成香港華人教會組成聯合組織，翌年成立香港基督教聯會。\n\n\n(4) 基督教週報《談天》1916、《大光週刊》1917（邢福增2014c：237-238）\n\n\n1910年代，有兩份基督教週報在香港創刊，均由自廣州來港的張亦鏡有關。1916年張亦鏡與尹文楷（尹淑貞父）組織談天報社，創辦《談天週刊》，逢星期日由大光報社出版。他在〈創刊宣言〉中說：「本報名談天，範圍極廣，而宗旨則注重說教，教不一，本報係基督徒所組織，自然所說是基督教。……然非主基督教而遂奴一切也。儒有善，必取之。道有善，必取之。釋及回及祆有善，必取之。乃至諸子諸史歐西群哲有善，亦無不並取之。……中外聖賢，道雖不同，其大原無非出於天，厥例即與萬卉各得日之一色同。然則人顧可以主日而遂奴萬卉，不屑取卉成色之理而一研窮之耶。……同人為是所由特組織是報，以添其力，意在能令凡已信仰基督而應負傳達教義責任旭，咸得所以效人救人之資，而尚立宮牆外之諸同胞，無論其為儒為道為釋為舊派新派，均知己與基督有密切之關係，而不忍執己善以相拒。」《談天》合共出版16期。\n\n\n繼《談天》後，張亦鏡創辦《大光週刊》。他在創刊號中特撰〈處暗之民見大光〉一文，闡釋週報的宗旨：「鳴呼，中國之民之處於幽暗亦已久矣，其宜得大光之照以示以應行之路，亦己不可一刻緩矣。顧安得無量數耶穌現身說法，俾中國處暗之民亦盡見大光乎……基督徒分子能各盡其分以所得光照人，故惟患其地無基督徒至矣。有基督徒至，則光既入者暗自失，任其地如何黑暗，亦可以使其民立見大光也。是故以口宣道，宣大光以照處暗之民也，以筆闡道，闡大光以照處暗之民也。」他又特別為《大光週刊》的內容定位，其中較重要者包括：（一）不載與宗教無涉之中外新聞；（二）不載尋常教會聚集紀事；（三）不載批評與宗教無關之時事論說；（四）不載逆道而語類教會現行讚歌之詩什；（五）不載盲闢各教而非其真相之文字。\n\n\n張亦鏡在1918年離港到汕頭復任《真光報》主筆。《大光週刊》既缺主編，乃於1918年月停刊。\n\n\n\n### (1) The Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign  \n\n(Sources: 劉粵聲 1996: 283–285; 麥梅生 1933; 楊國強 2010; 黃慧賢 2021: 63–77; 陳學然、吳家豪 2024: 178–200; Miners 1990: 117–129)  \n\n\nOne of the most impactful pre-war social movements initiated by Hong Kong churches was the Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign. Mui tsai referred to a system of indentured servitude involving young girls sold into domestic servitude or, in some cases, prostitution. Rooted in poverty, patriarchal traditions, and even abduction, the practice posed long-standing social and gender issues in Chinese society.  \n\n\nAlthough Hong Kong was under British colonial rule, the government, wary of disrupting influential local Chinese leaders, allowed the practice to continue. Efforts to abolish it gained traction in the late 19th century through humanitarian concerns expressed by expatriates.  \n\n\nThe movement gained momentum in the 1920s when Mrs. C. B. L. Haslewood, wife of a British naval officer, raised public awareness through articles and advocacy in Britain, pressuring the Hong Kong government to act. On July 31, 1921, a public meeting at the Tai Ping Theatre, attended by 300 people, revealed sharp divisions: Chinese elites sought to maintain the status quo, while a group of Christians opposed the practice.  \n\n\nIn August 1921, Christian leaders, including Yang Siu-Chuen and Mai Mei-Sang, founded the Anti-Mui Tsai Society, condemning the practice as inhumane and a violation of human rights. They advocated for legislative reforms and conducted public campaigns in schools, churches, and trade unions. Key figures such as Wong Mau-Lam, Chiu Wai-Chung, and Cheung Chu-Ling were instrumental in this decade-long struggle.  \n\n\nThe movement achieved significant milestones, starting with the Domestic Servants Ordinance of 1923 and culminating in stricter anti-trafficking laws in 1938. The campaign’s legacy includes publications such as The Mui Tsai Problem in Hong Kong (1923) and A Brief History of the Anti-Mui Tsai Movement (1933), preserving detailed accounts of this historic struggle.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n### (2) The Founding and Closure of The Ta Kwong Weekly, 1926  \n\n(Sources: 邢福增 2014: 239–240)  \n\n\nIn 1925, Christian journalist Cheung Yik-King returned to Hong Kong to lead Ta Kwong Pao at the invitation of chairman Wong Kwok-Shuen. To strengthen its religious focus, he rebranded a popular column into Enlightening Radiance, featuring religious essays and sermons.  \n\n\nRealizing the limitations of a daily newspaper format for in-depth religious discourse, Cheung launched a separate weekly publication, The Ta Kwong Weekly, on February 28, 1926, dedicated to Christian themes such as theology, poetry, essays, and fiction. In his inaugural editorial, Cheung expressed hope that the weekly would foster scholarly contributions from both local and international Christian communities.  \n\n\nCheung resigned in November 1926, citing concerns over political interference in Ta Kwong Pao. Despite efforts by Cheung Chu-Ling and others to retain him, his departure marked the end of his involvement with the publication.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n### (3) Lu Xun’s Lectures at the YMCA, 1927  \n\n(Source: 周惠斌 2009)  \n\n\nOn February 18 and 19, 1927, renowned Chinese writer Lu Xun delivered two lectures at the Chinese YMCA in Hong Kong, titled \"Silent China\" and \"The Tune is Played Out.\" Both were attended by over 600 people, with live Cantonese interpretation by Xu Guangping.  \n\n\nIn \"Silent China,\" Lu Xun criticized the use of archaic classical Chinese, advocating for modern vernacular expression to transform China into a nation with a vibrant voice. In \"The Tune is Played Out,\" he challenged outdated literary traditions and urged the youth to embrace freedom and reject conformity.  \n\n\nDespite the lectures' success, Lu Xun left Hong Kong with a poor impression. In his essay Reflections on Hong Kong, he recounted obstacles faced by organizers, such as censorship and restricted access to lecture tickets by opponents. His critique of \"national essence\" antagonized local elites, leaving a contentious legacy.\n\n(1) 反對蓄婢運動 The Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign（劉粵聲1996：283-285；麥梅生1933；楊國強2010；黃慧賢2021：63-77；陳學然、吳家豪2024：178-200；Miners 1990: 117-129）\n\n\n戰前香港教會人士發起較具影響的社會運動，首推反對蓄婢運動。蓄婢即「妹仔」，本質上是以契約為基礎的人口販賣，妹仔或充當家僕、妄侍甚至娼妓。除了家庭貧窮的原因外，也涉及重男輕女的傳統觀念，甚至綁架拐帶的罪行，可說是中國社會源遠流長的社會及婦女問題。雖然香港是英國殖民地，但殖民地政府為管治考量而避免觸動華人社會領袖的利益，故一直容許本地華人蓄婢。\n\n\n19世紀末，蓄婢問題受到部分寓港英人的關注，從人道主義立場提出質疑，引發社會討論。但政府方面，一直卻未予以正視。20世紀20年代，蓄婢問題受到中外教會人士的正視。先是英人希士勞活水師副司令（Lieutenant Commander H. L. Haslewood）的夫人Mrs. C. B. L. Haslewood 得悉香港蓄婢問題後，在1919年在英文報章撰文，引起香港社會上層人士的關注。她又在英國提倡廢除香港的蓄婢制度，在英國理藩院施壓下，香港政府要求定例局研究跟進。定例局華人議員劉鑄伯和何福於1921年7月31日，在太平戲院召開公眾會議，300名出席者中，華人社會菁英主張維護社會現況，與之抗衡者，是一群基督徒站在反蓄婢立場。是之會議並無法達致共識，並引發正反雙方繼續在報章上申論立場。而支持蓄婢者成立了「防範虐婢會」，試圖將問題轉至預防虐待妹仔。\n\n\n1921年8月，「反對蓄婢會」成立，發起人楊少泉、麥梅生等均為基督徒。在立會宣言中，指出蓄婢「有傷人道」，並且維持社會階級，把人視作工具，乃「敗壞喪行」，抑且縱容人口販賣及拐帶，業已違反國際公法，「大損國體」。後來，他們更加入「人權」觀念，指斥蓄婢「蹂躝人權」。反對蓄婢會一方面展開民間宣傳，在學校、教會、行業公會、工會及商界作演說，爭取輿論支持，並獲得社會各界的肯定；另方面又積極推動立法，保障婦孺權益。參與運動者，包括黃茂林（青年會）、楊少泉（青年會、奮興會）、麥梅生（培道聯愛會）、徐茂枝（奮興會）、王愛棠（禮賢會）、張祝齡（中華基督教會）、周懷璋（青年會、奮興會）等，均為基督教民間菁英領袖。從1923年的《家庭女役條例》開始，一直至1938年再次修訂相關條例，嚴格禁止買賣及蓄養婢女，並安排所有養女必需經華民政務司進行登記， 「妹仔」問題才得到解決。整個運動延續了十多年，期間該會先後出版《香港蓄婢問題》（1923）及《反對蓄婢史略》（1933）等書，為這段歷史留下詳盡的文字見證。\n\n\n(2) 基督教週報《大光日曜》創刊與停刊1926（邢福增2014：239-240）\n\n\n1925年，張亦鏡應《大光報》董事會主席王國璇邀請，再次來港主持報務。為強化《大光報》的宗教形象，他與編輯部張祝齡商討後，決定將原有以言情文字小說為主的「香海微波」欄目，改為「放大光明」，收錄名牧演詞及有關宗教的著述。初期，「放大光明」欄全為說教文字，但有意見認為內容「太專」，除宗教文章外，建議包括家庭、婦女、兒童、農工商、學生等項，每日有不同主題。惟討論過程中，又考慮到宗教文章篇幅較長，純以日報方式並不足夠。於是張亦鏡建議另出一週刊作宗教專號，將宗教文章轉刊於此，逢週六出版，命名為《大光日曜》，第一期於1926年2月28日出版。為專注宗教專刊的編務，張亦鏡正式請辭《大光報》編輯，轉任《大光報》名譽編輯。\n\n\n在〈緣起〉中，張亦鏡表達對《大光日曜》的願景：「顧記者年已老矣，且復不學無術，所欲盡之天職，在己雖可求心安，在人或轉嫌疣贅，不惟無禆於世，且恐窒道之行，是不得不有望於中外教會學者，仍照常源源惠稿，適著、譯述、詩歌、小說，……凡本刊之所宜備，皆可以撰就擲下，即非身在教會，而對教有所論議，亦本刊之所歡迎。」\n\n\n由於《大光日曜》是宗教專號，每期內容均以基督教為主，內容包括論著、譯述、雜俎、諧談、詩歌等。1926年11月28日出版的《大光日曜》的〈編者言〉中，宣佈了張亦鏡離職的安排。考查張氏離開原因，據其後來自述，是因為他得悉有「某派黨人來收買港中某某等報，大光報亦在彼運動中」。為了不涉入政治黨派之爭，他乃於1926年3月中旬上書堅決請辭。當時張祝齡以董事局書記及編輯部監督身分致函挽留，惜張去意已決。\n\n\n(3) 魯迅在基督教青年會會所演講 1927（周惠斌2009）\n\n\n1927年2月18日及19日，中華基督教青年會會所禮堂舉行作家魯迅的兩場演講，題目分別為「無聲的中國」及「老調子已經唱完」。兩次演講都需由許廣平即時傳譯為廣州話。兩場演講座無虛席，600多人把青年會禮堂擠得水洩不通。\n\n\n在「無聲的中國」演講中，魯迅指中國人用難懂的古文，講的是陳舊的古意思，所有的聲音皆是過去的，都就是等於零。他認為要說現代的、活著的白話，令青年將中國變成有聲的中國，「大膽地說話，勇敢地進行」。魯迅在「老調子已經唱完」演講中，則提到中國的文章最沒有變化、調子最老、思想最舊，促拋棄老調子。他以坐監作比喻，指貪安穩就沒有自由，要自由便總要經歷一些危險，但這兩條路哪一條路好是「明明白白的」。\n\n\n不過，魯迅此行對香港並沒有留下好的印象。他後來在〈略談香港〉中，提及是次演講「主持其事的人大約受了許多困難……先是頗受遭干涉，中途又有反對者派人索取入場券，收藏起來，使別人不能去聽；後來又不許將講稿登後，經交涉的結果，是削去和改竄了許多」。他又指自己在香港「攻擊國粹」，「得罪了若干人」。\n\n\n\n\n(1) John Sung’s Revival Meetings (Levi 1995: 110, 116-117, 210-211, 261)\n\nJohn Sung (1901–1944) was a renowned evangelist in modern China. In the 1930s, he conducted four revival meetings in Hong Kong.\n\nThe first meeting, held from March 6 to 12, 1932, at the Bethel Mission, featured instances such as \"many preachers and Bible school students confessing their sins to one another and seeking forgiveness.\" One notable event was a \"disobedient son reconciling with his mother and praying together.\" This meeting was part of the Bethel Evangelistic Band’s South China tour. After leaving Hong Kong, they traveled to Guangzhou, Wuzhou, Guixian, and Yulin. Sung returned to Hong Kong from Guangzhou for another session from April 28 to May 8, also at the Bethel Mission, where 32 individuals requested baptism. Later, he led study groups at the Methodist Church and hosted a citywide union meeting at the Hop Yat Church. During this visit, he prayed for the ailing wife of Lin Hu, shared his message at the Xinguang Blind School, and, at the invitation of Zhang Jisheng, preached to over a hundred workers at the Anleyuan Biscuit Factory, leading many to tears of repentance.\n\nFrom June 14 to 25, 1936, Sung returned to Hong Kong and was hosted by Lin Zifeng. His sermons on the “Church of Laodicea” criticized Hong Kong churches for \"failing to shine for the Lord and squandering God's grace.\" He remarked that \"many have time to make coffins but no time to shine for the Lord as witnesses.\" Responding to Sung's call, 50 evangelistic teams were formed, with Lin Zifeng elected as their leader. Upon Sung's departure, 200 people gathered at the pier to sing hymns as they bid him farewell.\n\nFrom May 13 to 18, 1938, Sung held meetings at Minsheng Academy in Kowloon, where \"117 people experienced spiritual blessings, 164 individuals received the laying on of hands, and 21 new evangelistic teams were formed.\"\n\n\n(2) Indigenous Church Architecture (Xing Fuzeng and Liu Shaolin 2010: 71-74; Wei Keli and Chen Ruiwen 2014: 89-100; Lung Ping-yee 1992: 129)\n\nIn 1932, when Ronald O. Hall was appointed as the seventh Bishop of the Diocese of Victoria (Diocese of Hong Kong and South China), he envisioned that future church architecture should adopt a Chinese style externally while incorporating foreign designs internally.\n\nIn 1933, when the Hong Kong government informed the Anglican Church that the land for Holy Trinity Church in Kowloon City would be reclaimed for leveling Victoria Peak, Hall supported rebuilding Holy Trinity Church using Chinese architectural styles. Churches with traditional Chinese architectural features could be seen as \"China's Renaissance.\" The emergence of such churches was closely tied to the 20th-century Christian indigenization movement. Professor Lung Ping-yee from the Department of Architecture at the University of Hong Kong noted, “During the 1920s, the 'Anti-Christian' or 'Anti-Religion' movements in China resisted Western religious ideologies. By the 1930s, Chinese churches were established with strong patriotic religious sentiments, seeking independence not only in liturgy and theology but also in administration and finances. Consequently, church buildings began adopting Chinese designs to align with the principles of 'self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance.'” Ronald O. Hall was a key advocate for this “Sinicized” church architecture. As a British missionary, Hall continuously sought ways to harmonize Christianity with Chinese society and culture.\n\nIn 1930, Norwegian missionary Karl Ludvig Reichelt from the Christian Mission to Buddhists founded Tao Fong Shan in Sha Tin. The monastery was designed entirely in the style of a Buddhist temple, aiming to create a dialogue space between Christianity and Buddhism and guide monks to Christ. Hall greatly admired Reichelt’s vision and efforts. Hall’s advocacy for combining Chinese architectural styles with Christian sanctuaries was likely inspired by Reichelt.\n\nDuring Hall’s tenure, two Anglican churches rebuilt in Hong Kong, Holy Trinity Church and St. Mary’s Church, adopted Chinese architectural styles. Both were designed by Ng Kin-chung.\n\nAdditionally, in 1930s Hong Kong, the South China Regional Seminary (1931) of the Catholic Church adopted classical Chinese architectural patterns. The original design was intended as a courtyard-style complex. However, due to economic constraints, the wings and upper stories of the main building were omitted, leaving only the south wing completed (Lam Se-ling 2010: 177-179).\n\n\n(1) 宋尚節香港佈道會 John Sung’s  Revival Meetings（利未1995：110、16-117、210-211、261）\n\n\n宋尚節（1901-1944）是近代中國著名佈道家。他在三十年代曾四次來港主領佈道會。第一次（1932年3月6至12日）在便以利會領會，「許多傳道人及聖經學院學生彼此認罪互求饒恕」，更令一位「不孝子」與母親和好，一起禱告。這次是伯特利佈道團的華南巡迴佈道，離開香港後到廣州、梧州、貴縣、玉林。然後在4月28至5月8日再次由廣州抵港，在便以利會聚會有32人要求受浸。後來，他又到循道會領查組，及到合一堂領全港聯合大會。期間曾到林護家為其患病妻子禱告。又到心光盲人院分享，及應張吉盛邀請到他創辦的安樂園餅乾廠為百多名工人講道 ，眾人流淚認罪。\n\n\n1936年6月14至25日，宋抵港後，由林子豐接待，後以「老底嘉教會」為題，批評香港教會「不能為主發光，真虧負了神的恩典。許多人有時間忙於發棺材，但沒有時間為主發光作見證」。在宋呼籲下，香港成立了50隊佈道團，林子豐被選為團長。他離港時，200人在碼頭唱詩告別。\n\n\n1938年5月13至18日，他在九龍民生書院聚會，「一百一十七人蒙恩，為一百六十四人按手，增加二十一個佈道隊」。\n\n\n(2) 本色化建築 Indigenous Church Architecture（邢福增、劉紹麟 2010：71-74；魏克利、陳睿文2014：89-100；龍炳頤1992：129）\n\n\n1932年，何明華（Ronald O. Hall）就任維多利亞教區（港粵教區）第七任主教後，期望日後教會禮拜堂之建築款式，外面宜用中國形式，內面可採用外國款式。1933年香港府通知聖公會教區議會須收回九龍城聖三一堂地段，以便夷平維多利亞山後，何明華即支持以中國建築風格興建聖三一堂。具傳統中國建築特色的教堂，可視作「中國的文藝復興」。富中國傳統建築特色的教堂的出現，跟20世紀基督教的本色化（Indigenization）運動有密切關係。香港大學建築系龍炳頤教授指出：「在本世紀二十年代，中國國內產生了『非基』運動或『反教』運動，對西方傳入的宗教思想作出全面抗拒，而三十年代建立的中國人自己的教會，卻帶有濃厚的愛國宗教思想，它不只是在禮儀上、神學上有所改變，甚至在行政上、經濟上也要獨立，於是教堂的建築形式也實行中國化，以配合『自養、自傳、自治』的路向。」何明華正是這種「中國化」教堂的主要推手。作為英國傳教士，如何融合基督教能與中國社會、文化是他一直的期許。1930年，挪威籍的道友會（Christian Mission to Buddhists）傳教士艾香德（Karl Ludvig Reicheld）在沙田道風山創辦基督教叢林，便完全採取佛教寺院的設計，希望可以在基督教與佛教間建立對話空間，進而引領僧侶皈信。何明華十分欣賞艾氏的異象與努力，何氏主張把中國建築風格與基督教聖堂結合，未嘗不是受到艾香德的啟迪。在他任內，香港聖公會兩所同期重建的聖堂（聖三一堂及聖瑪利亞堂），均採用中國特色的建築風格，由吳建中設計。\n\n\n1930年代香港，尚有天主教華南總修院（1931），同樣採用中式古典建築方格，原設計是四合院式建築，但最後因經濟原因，取消了主樓的兩翼及屋頂高樓，只建成了主樓（南樓）（林社鈴2010：177-179）。\n\n\n\n (1) Ordination of Chinese Theologian Zhao Zichen in Hong Kong  \n\n(Cited from Xing Fu Zeng, 2003: 139-140; Wu Qing, 2017: 76-79; Paton, 1985: 103-105)  \n\n\nOn July 20, 1941, Zhao Zichen, a prominent Chinese theologian and Dean of the School of Religion at Yenching University, was ordained as a pastor in a unique ceremony held in Hong Kong. The ordination was conducted at the small chapel of the Bishop's House by Bishop R. O. Hall, who performed three separate rites: transferring Zhao into the Anglican communion, commissioning him as a deacon, and ordaining him as a priest. Originally affiliated with the Methodist Church, Zhao’s connection with the Anglican Church was influenced by his longstanding relationship with Bishop Hall.  \n\n\nIn 1939, Zhao took a sabbatical from Yenching University and accepted an invitation to serve as a pastor at Wenlin Chapel in Kunming. During his time there, he inquired about joining the Anglican Church. Upon returning to Beijing, Zhao expressed that his sense of calling had become clearer. One of his students, Luo Zhenfang, recounted Zhao saying that the acceptance of church authority resolved many of his spiritual struggles. Bishop Hall recalled Zhao stating that he sought not only to “join the priesthood” but also to “submit to the priesthood.”  \n\n\nHowever, Zhao faced severe accusations during the 1951 denunciation campaigns at Yenching University. In response, Bishop Ling Xianyang of the North China Diocese publicly revoked Zhao’s priestly duties and all associated responsibilities. Despite this, Zhao was invited in 1954 as a delegate to the National Christian Conference, where he was elected as a committee member.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Publication of History of Christianity in Hong Kong, 1941  \n\n(Cited from Xing Fu Zeng, 2014b: 245-246)  \n\n\nThe publication of History of Christianity in Hong Kong was led by Pastor Liu Yue Sheng of the Baptist Independent Church on Caine Road. Liu had served in Guangzhou and Shanghai as a Baptist minister before being invited to pastor the Chinese Baptist Church in San Francisco (1929–1932). He returned to Guangzhou in 1932, becoming pastor of East Hill Baptist Church and holding positions such as President of the Guangdong Baptist Association and the National Baptist Union of China.  \n\n\nIn 1934, Liu edited A Brief History of Baptist Churches in Guangdong for the association and, in 1936, An Overview of Christianity in Guangzhou for the city’s Christian Council. After moving to Hong Kong in 1938, Liu was elected Vice President of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. Although the union lacked a formal publishing division, Liu spearheaded the editorial work for the History of Christianity in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nIn the preface, Liu explained that in April 1940, the union decided to compile and publish a historical record. A committee of seven, including prominent figures such as Zhang Zhu Ling, Wong Oi Tong, and Liu, oversaw the project. Divided into seven sections, the book covered denominational histories, church profiles, joint ventures, cultural endeavors, charitable work, social services, and biographies. Published in August 1941, it was described as a pioneering effort in documenting Hong Kong’s Christian history.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Anglican Church’s Ten-Year Forward Movement, 1946  \n\n(Cited from Zhong Ren Li, 1951: 33)  \n\n\nAfter World War II, Bishop R. O. Hall returned to Hong Kong and launched the “Ten-Year Forward Movement” in January 1946. This initiative aimed to double the number of believers and clergy within the Hong Kong and Guangdong Diocese over a decade. Members were encouraged to bring at least one friend to church each week and pray daily for those interested in faith.  \n\n\nThe movement formally began on January 25, 1946, with a flag presentation ceremony at St. John’s Cathedral. The flags, bearing St. Andrew’s Cross, symbolized the call to evangelize modeled after St. Andrew. In The Voice of the Church in South China, Pastor Zhong Ren Li emphasized the need for comprehensive promotion, including written materials to supplement in-person advocacy.\n\n\nThe Ten-Year Forward Movement was part of a broader post-war trend, as other denominations launched similar campaigns. For instance, the National Christian Council of China initiated a three-year “Christian Advance Campaign” (1947–1950) to spread the Gospel and rebuild moral foundations.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) Centenary of the Victoria Diocese, 1949  \n\n(Cited from Zhong Ren Li, 1951: 36-39)  \n\n\nThe Victoria Diocese, established in 1849, celebrated its centenary in 1949. Over the century, the diocese underwent several territorial changes, losing regions as new dioceses were formed, including North China (1872), Japan (1883), Fujian (1906), Guangxi-Hunan (1909), and Yunnan-Guizhou (1947). By 1947, the Hong Kong and Guangdong Diocese (formerly Victoria Diocese) covered Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Guangxi.\n\n\nCentenary events included a fundraising campaign, a diocesan council meeting, a study retreat, and a thanksgiving service. The council elected Reverend Mu Rong Xian as the Bishop of Guangdong. The celebration also produced historical accounts, including Zhong Ren Li’s A Brief History of the Anglican Diocese of South China (1951) and The Diocese of Victoria, Hong Kong: A Hundred Years Church History, 1849–1949 by George B. Endacott and Dorothy E. She.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Christian Contingency Meetings, 1949  \n\n(Cited from Xing Fu Zeng, 2004: 102; He Ming Zhang, 2021: 55-65)  \n\n\nAmid the Chinese Civil War, churches in South China prepared for Communist control. In July and August 1949, the Guangdong branch of the National Christian Council of China held a summer conference at Diocesan Boys’ School in Hong Kong, known as the “Guangdong Christian Affairs Review Conference.” Participants from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau discussed strategies for addressing Communist challenges.  \n\n\nChurches adopted a dual approach: while emphasizing that missionary organizations would not retreat immediately, they established financial offices in Hong Kong and relocated property deeds and archives as precautions.  \n\n\nFor instance, the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA) evacuated approximately 80 missionaries to Hong Kong in June 1949. Alfred C. Snead, Secretary-General of C&MA’s Foreign Missions Department, established a temporary “All-China Alliance Office” in Hong Kong, which operated until 1953, when the “China-Hong Kong Field” was formally created. This reflected the widespread strategic adjustments churches made to navigate the uncertain political landscape.\n\n(1)中國神學家趙紫宸在香港按牧（邢福增2003：139-140；吳青2017：76-79；Paton 1985: 103-105）\n\n\n1941年7月20日，中國著名神學家，燕京大學宗教學院院長趙紫宸毅然接受牧職。是次按牧的安排比較特別，他特地來到香港，在聖公會會督府的小禮堂內，由何明華主教（Bishop R. O. Hall）先後三次按手，為趙舉行轉會禮，派立他為會吏，按立他為會長（牧師）。趙氏原屬監理會，他與聖公會的聯繫，主要是因著何明華的關係。何、趙兩人相識多年，1938年秋冬之交，趙應全國協進會邀請，赴印度參加瑪德拉斯國際宣教會議。回國後 （1939年7月），他接受聖公會的邀請，乘著燕京大學安息年的機會，到雲南昆明的聖公會文林堂負責堂會的牧養工作。在昆明期間，趙曾向何明華查詢加入聖公會的可能。當趙回到北平後，表達自己的呼召變得深刻且清晰。燕大宗教學院畢業生駱振芳憶述趙曾對他們說：以前總是走個人追求信仰的道路，有些問題想不通就增加許多苦惱。後來受了聖公會聖職，在信仰上接受教會的權威，這樣可以解除許多思想矛盾和苦惱。何明華亦憶述，趙接受按立前嘗言，他接受牧職不僅是期望「加入聖品」（in orders），而更是希望「順服聖品」（under orders）。\n\n\n1951年3月，趙紫宸在燕京大學控訴運動中受到嚴厲指控，中華聖公會華北教區主教凌賢揚公開宣佈，撤銷趙會長及一切在聖公會華北教區的職務。1954年7月，趙以中華聖公會會長身分，獲邀請出席基督教全國會議，並選為全體委員之一。\n\n\n(2) 《香港基督教會史》出版1941（邢福增2014b：245-246）\n\n\n《香港基督教會史》的出版，實得力於香港堅道浸信自理會會牧劉粵聲。劉早年先後於廣州及上海任浸信會傳道，1929至1932年間應邀任美國三藩市華人自理浸信會牧師。1932年至1937年間任廣州東山浸信會牧師，兼兩廣浸信會會長、全國浸信聯合會長及廣州基督教聯會會長等職。1934年，兩廣浸信會聯會決定出版《兩廣浸信會史略》，便由劉氏主編。1936年間，他又承廣州基督教聯會所託，編著《廣州基督教概況》。1938年1月起，劉粵聲來港任浸信自理會會牧，同年被選為香港基督教聯會副會長。當時聯會仍未設有出版部，《香港基督教會史》的編輯工作， 便由劉氏一力承擔。\n\n \n\n劉粵聲在《香港基督教會史》的序言中指，聯會於1940年4月會議時決定編印有關會史，並選出張祝齡、翁挺生、鍾仁立、王愛棠、何道修、黃仲凱及劉粵聲等七人為委辦，負責彙編工作。全書分會宗史略、堂會史略、聯合事業、文化事業、慈善事業、社會事業及個人傳記七部分，主要由相關教會及組織人士賜稿，最後於1941年8月出版，可說是香港基督教會「嘗試之『創刊物』」。\n\n\n(3) 聖公會十年神國運動1946（鍾仁立1951：33）\n\n\n戰後復原，聖公會何明華主教回港主理教政，於1946年1月組織「十年神國運動」（Ten Year Forward Movement），由各堂展開工作，招收會員。運動旨在鼓勵信徒引人歸主，凡加入為會員者，每週至少須帶一人赴聖堂聽道，每日須為學道之親友禱告。「神國運動」的目的，是在十年內港粵教區信徒實現倍增，並使聖品人數由20人增至40人。1月25日，在聖約翰座堂舉行授旗典禮，何明華主教證道。各堂代表領旗一面，旗幟為聖安得烈之十架，勉勵信徒以聖安得烈引人歸主為模範。\n\n\n在《港粵教聲》復刊詞中，主編鍾仁立牧師提到神國運動的重要性：「神國運動，是我們教區復員後的一個新運動，是動員整個教區的人力物力來推進的。這樣一個大運動，想快快推進到鄉村裏面每一個工作場所，和一切計劃想有預期的成果，非有完備的宣傳工夫不可，除了派員去各處宣傳以外，應該有文字宣傳以副口舌宣傳之不逮。」事實上，回到戰後的歷史處境，神國運動並非創新之舉，其時全國不同宗派，也陸續推行類似的「前進運動」。例如1946年12月，中華全國基督教協進會決定於1947至1950年間發動「基督教奮進運動三年計劃」，目的就是宣揚基督福音及重建道德基礎。\n\n\n(4) 聖公會粵港/維多利亞教區百週年紀念1949（鍾仁立1951：36-39 ）\n\n\n1849年維多利亞教區成立，施美夫主教於是年5月被祝聖為教區主教。1949年是教區成立百週年紀念。一百年來，教區轄境歷幾改變，由原初全國中國（及日本），到1872年分出華北教區，1883年分出日本教區，1906年分出福建教區，1909年分出廣西－湖南教區，1947年分出雲貴教區。質言之，自1947年後，港粵教區（維多利亞教區）轄境包括香港、廣東及廣西。是次教區百週年紀念活動，包括：賣物會、百週年教區議會、講道進修會、百週年經常費運動及百週年紀念感恩崇拜大會。在8月舉行的百週年教區議會中，通過選出慕容賢會吏長為廣東主教。此外，又有關於教區百年史的編寫，分別為鍾仁立編著《中華聖公會華南教區百年史略》（1951），及George B Endacott & Dorothy E. She, The Diocese of Victoria, Hong Kong: A Hundred Years Church History, 1849-1949 （1949）。\n\n\n(5) 基督教應變會議 1949（邢福增 2004：102；何明章2021：55-65）\n\n\n面對國共內戰形勢的變化，華南地區各教會急謀應變。中華全國基督教協進會廣東分會於1949年7-8月間，在香港拔萃書院召開一次包括廣東省、香港和澳門地區的「宣教同工夏令會」，定名為「廣東基督教事工檢討會」，商討如何應付共產黨的挑戰。一般而言，各宗派及組織的部署大致相同，一方面重申差會機構暫不撤退，但另方面又在港設立財政機構或辦事處，並將契據及檔案移至香港，以為後著。\n\n\n美國宣道會方面，宣道會國外宣教部總幹事施納德（Alfred C. Snead）於1949年6月1至3日來港。召開特別會議，決定吩咐全部在中國的傳教士撤退至香港。當時有大約80名傳教士從撒離至香港，在等候差會進一步指示。6月底，施由越南西貢再返回香港，跟中國各教區主席商討，又接見傳教士，並按各人意願安排新的宣教工場。施回到美國向總會報告中國形勢，宣道會總會評估中共在短期內會南下接管香港，決定不在香港設立宣教據點，只設立臨時性的「宣道會全中國辦事處」（All-China Alliance Office），臨時辦事處只運作三年多，至1953年4月美國總會同意建立「中國－香港宣教區」（China-Hong Kong Field）為止。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Hong Kong Bible Conference, 1950 (Li Kam Keung & Wong Choi Lin, 2019: 180-197)\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Bible Conference is a major event for the Christian community in Hong Kong and is held annually to this day. Its origins date back to the Guangzhou Bible Conference, which began in 1927. Starting in 1928, the conference was held annually in Guangzhou in July and then moved to Hong Kong in August. The event was suspended during the Second Sino-Japanese War but resumed in 1946. The final conference held in mainland China took place in Guangzhou in August 1949, and from 1950 onward, the event was relocated to Hong Kong, renamed the \"Hong Kong Bible Conference.\"\n\n\nThe conference includes Bible study sessions and revival meetings. During the 1950s, the speakers were evenly divided between Western missionaries and Chinese pastors. Notable Western speakers included Charles L. Culpepper (Baptist), Norman Nelson, William C. Newbren (Christian and Missionary Alliance), Charles Roberts (Hunan Bible Institute), Paul H. Bartel (Christian and Missionary Alliance), R. W. Frame (China Inland Mission), David Adeney (China Inland Mission), Gladys Ward, Ruth Hitchcock (Hebron Mission), and Gordon Dunn (China Inland Mission). Prominent Chinese speakers included Chou Chi Yu (China Evangelistic Mission), Timothy T. Ting, Pang Fook (Lutheran Church), Yang Chun Zhe (Alliance Bible Seminary), Wong Zhi (Christian and Missionary Alliance), Qi En Lian (Lutheran Church), Xu Song Shi (Baptist Church), Xie You Wang (Hunan Bible Institute), Chang Jung Chiang (Baptist Church), Zeng Lin Fang (Bethel Theological Seminary), Yu Li Gong (Chinese Christian Students Union), Chou Yu Xi (Methodist Church), and Yeh Pak Nam.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Revival of Baptist Youth Fellowships (Chan Hoi Him, 2015: 18-26; Xing Fuzeng, 2004: 166-167)\n\n\nIn the 1950s, figures influenced by the evangelical revival tradition, such as Zhao Junying, John Chen, and Zheng Guo, came to Hong Kong, along with local leaders like Hu En De of the Joyful Gospel Hall. They were invited to lead various revival meetings, sparking a wave of spiritual renewal among young believers. \n\n\nOne notable event was the Baptist Youth Fellowship summer camp held on Cheung Chau Island in 1951. Led by Hu En De and Zhao Junying, the camp drew over 80 participants. According to Hu En De, on the final evening, \"many young people were enlightened before the Lord, confessed their sins, and prayed throughout the night.\" These youths experienced significant transformations in their lives, emphasizing:  \n\n1. The doctrine of being born again,  \n\n2. Pursuing a holy life,  \n\n3. Studying and learning from the Bible,  \n\n4. Enthusiastically sharing the gospel, and  \n\n5. Actively serving in the church.\n\n\nParticipant Chan Hoi Him recalled tearful prayers and a deep conviction from the Holy Spirit, leading them to repent and even write letters to their parents confessing their sins. After the camp, the revival fire continued as participants shared their experiences with others who had not attended. \n\n\nYouth fellowship leaders organized a three-day non-residential retreat at various Baptist churches, including Caine Road Baptist Church, Kowloon City Baptist Church, and Tsim Sha Tsui Baptist Church. Additionally, they launched a \"100,000 Tracts Campaign,\" distributing gospel tracts across Hong Kong in a single day. These annual summer camps became a hallmark of revival for the Baptist Youth Fellowship, though tensions later arose between the fellowship and the Baptist Convention, leading to movements like the Gospel Hall Movement in the 1960s.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Bishop Hall’s Visit to China, 1956 (Ng Ching, 2017: 142-154; Chan-Yeung, 2015: 134-142)\n\n\nFrom May 30 to June 24, 1956, Bishop R. O. Hall of the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau visited China, becoming the first Hong Kong church leader to visit China after the establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949. This visit attracted widespread attention, as the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in China aimed to sever ties between Christianity and imperialism.\n\n\nThe visit occurred during China's \"Hundred Flowers Campaign,\" which fostered a relatively open environment, allowing exchanges between Chinese and Western churches. Bishop Hall met with clergy from the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui and visited Anglican churches in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. Notably, he attended the opening ceremony of the third session of the First National People’s Congress and was received and hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai.\n\n\nAfter his visit, Bishop Hall published an article titled The Church in the New China: Social Evils have Disappeared in the Revolution, praising the changes brought by the revolution and claiming that the church had not been harmed. His favorable view of communist China earned him the nickname \"Pink Bishop\" in Hong Kong media.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) Billy Graham Crusades, 1956 (SCMP, 1956; Overseas Chinese Daily News, 1956 a, b, c, d)\n\n\nIn February 1956, renowned American evangelist Billy Graham held his first crusade in Hong Kong as part of his Far East tour, which also included stops in the Philippines, India, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. His visit to Hong Kong lasted from February 13 to 16. A 25-member committee, comprising representatives from various denominations and organizations, was formed to organize the event, symbolizing unprecedented cooperation among Christian groups in Hong Kong.\n\n\nDuring his stay, Graham met with church leaders, theological seminary students, and Bible college students at Pui Ching Middle School. A mass choir of over 1,000 singers and an equal number of volunteers participated in the crusade, marking a first in Hong Kong's Christian history. \n\n\nOn February 15, Graham led an outdoor evangelistic rally attended by approximately 40,000 people at the South China Athletic Association Stadium and Government Stadium. Around 4,000 people responded to the altar call. Special late-night train services were arranged to accommodate attendees.\n\n\nBilly Graham returned to Hong Kong for crusades in 1975 and 1990. In 1990, Hong Kong Baptist College awarded him an honorary doctorate.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Christian Civic Movement, 1956 (Ni Kam Fai, 1966)\n\n\nUnder the leadership of Bishop R. O. Hall, the Hong Kong Christian Council’s Executive Committee established the \"Christian Civic Movement Subcommittee\" in 1956. The movement aimed to:  \n\n1. Promote research on social issues and Christian responses,  \n\n2. Enhance civic responsibility in daily life, and  \n\n3. Encourage churches and Christian organizations to unite in opposing societal evils.\n\n\nThe movement emphasized the need for Christians to lead ethical lives within their communities, hoping to inspire broader civic awareness among the general population. \n\n\nIn 1957, the council distributed leaflets titled The Responsibility of Christians Towards Society to 89 churches and organizations, organized speech and essay contests in Christian schools, and advocated for Civic Awareness Weeks in Christian youth fellowships. Collaborating with Radio Rediffusion, the council produced programs on civic issues featuring religious leaders.\n\n\nSubsequent activities included a \"Good Citizen\" photography contest in 1961, with 100 winning entries displayed at City Hall, and the publication of a 64-panel Good Citizen comic collection in 1962. In 1965, July was designated \"Christian Civic Sunday\" for promoting civic teachings in churches.\n\n\nThe committee also voiced opinions on societal issues, including opposition to legalized soccer gambling (1959), campaigns against legalizing off-track horse betting (1964), resisting the expansion of bars in Kowloon (1966), and advocating for anti-drug campaigns (1966).\n\n(1) 港九培靈研經會 Hong Kong Bible Conference, 1950 (李金強、黃彩蓮2019：180-197)\n\n\n港九培靈研經會是香港教會的盛事，迄今仍每年舉行。其起源可追溯至1927年開始的廣州「培靈研經大會」，從1928年起每年7月在廣州舉行，到8月便移師香港。抗戰期間因戰亂停辦，至1946年復員後復會。1949年8月於廣州為在中國大陸舉行的最後一屆，1950年起在香港復辦，易名「港九培靈研經會」。\n\n\n培靈研經會包括研經會、培靈（奮興）會，五十年代應邀領會者西教士及華人各半，其中西教士包括：柯理培（Charles L. Culpepper，浸信會）、納爾遜（Norman Nelson）、劉福群（William C. Newbren，宣道會）、饒培德（Charles Roberts，湖南聖經學校）、包忠傑（Paul H. Bartel，宣道會）、費述凱（R. W. Frame，內地會）、艾德理（David Adeney，內地會）、汪長仁（Gladys Ward，）、何義思（Ruth Hitchcock，希伯崙會）、鄧普華（Gordon Dunn，內地會）等。華人講員則有：周志禹（中華傳道會）、滕近輝、彭福（信義會）、楊濬哲（建道聖經學院）、王峙（宣道會）、齊恩廉（信義會）、徐松石（浸信會）、謝友王（湖南聖經學校）、張容江（浸信會）、曾霖芳（伯特利神學院）、于力工（中國基督徒學生聯合會）、周郁晞（衛理公會）、葉伯南。\n\n\n(2) 浸信會少年團聯會復興（陳喜謙2015：18-26；邢福增2004：166-167）\n\n\n五十年代後，好些深受奮興佈道傳統影響的人士，例如趙君影、陳約翰、鄭果等相繼來港，加上本地喜樂福音堂的胡恩德，他們應邀主領不同令會，在部分青少年信徒間，掀起一陣復興之風。其中1951年浸信會少年團在長洲的聯合夏令會，成為五十年代浸信會少年團契復興之火的肇始。是次夏令會由胡恩德及趙君影主講，有80多人參加，據胡恩德指出，在最後一晚，「有不少青年人在主前蒙光照，認罪悔改，整夜禱告」。這群青年人「蒙恩」後，在生活上有了重大的改變：（一）著重重生道理；（二）追求聖潔生活；（三）努力在主的話上學習，研讀聖經；（四）熱心傳揚福音；（五）熱心參與教會事奉。其中一位參加者陳喜謙憶述，各人流淚禱告，並深受聖靈感動及催迫認罪悔改。這些少年人為罪自責，彼此認罪，也寫信回家向父母認罪。夏令會後，復興之火仍在各人心中燃點，把在營中的感動與領受，各未有參加夏令會的團友分享。有少年團聯會的負責弟兄姊妹，決定舉行一連三日的非住宿退會，分別在士他令道浸信會、堅道浸信會及尖沙咀浸信會舉行。此外，團友又發起「十萬單張運動」，分隊到各區派發福音單張，一天內派發了十萬張單張。自此，浸信會少年團聯會每年的夏令會，參加者都經歷復興。不過，這也伏下少年團聯會與浸信會聯會間的矛盾與張力及六十年代初福音堂運動的出現（參1960年代「福音堂運動」）。\n\n\n(3) 何明華會督訪問中國 1956（吳青2017：142-154；Chan-Yeung 2015: 134-142）\n\n\n1956年5月30日至6月24日，聖公會港澳教區主教何明華（ Bishop Hall）訪問中國，成為1949年中共建國後，首位訪問中國的香港教會領袖。自五十年代起，中國基督教開展以割斷基督教與帝國主義關係為目標的三自革新（愛國）運動，作為在殖民地香港的英國傳教士，是次訪華行程自然受到廣泛關注。\n\n\n何氏訪華的時間，正值中國處於「百花齊放，百家爭鳴」的寬鬆處境，中國教會恢復與西方教會的交流。在行程中，他除了與中華聖公會的教牧見外，又到訪廣州、上海、南京、北京的聖公會。更特別的是，他獲邀旁聽第一屆全國人民代表大會第三次會議的開幕式，並受中國總理周恩來接見及宴請。\n\n\n訪問結束後，何明華發表了 “The Church in the New China: Social Evils have Disappeared in the Revolution” 一文，高度讚揚革命後的新中國，並指教會並未受到破壞。由於他對紅色中國的肯定，因此香港報刊有稱他為「粉紅色主教」（Pink Bishop）。\n\n\n(4) 葛培理香港佈道大會 Billy Graham Crusades, 1956（SCMP 1956；華僑日報1956 a,b,c,d）\n\n\n美國著名佈道家葛培理（Billy Graham）於1956年2月首次在香港主領大佈道會，此行為葛遠東巡迴佈道之旅，行程包括菲律賓、印度、日本、台灣、韓國等地，訪港日期為2月13至16日。為籌備是次佈道會，香港教會人士成立了廿五人籌備委員會，包括張有光（主席）、林子豐、黃作、李貞明、彭福、李求思、劉粵聲、彭紹賢、陳翼堅、楊濬哲、貝光道、劉福群等，涉及各宗派及男女青年會等團體，被視為「中西各基督團體從來未有之大合作」。葛培理訪港期間，除主領2月15日晚公開露天佈道會外，於當日上午會跟各教會人士、神學院、聖經學院師生等在培正中學一聚。\n\n\n香港眾教會，又組成千人的聯合詩班，在佈道會上合唱，同時又組成千多人的義工，也是香港基督教史上首次。\n\n\n葛氏抵港當日，談及「本人非一政治家，而僅為人類為上帝服務」，又解釋基督徒與馬克斯主義者的分別在於，基督徒認為「每一個人除肉體外，尚有靈魂，即吾人從內心修養，達至心境清潔無邪，則所造之事，祗有博愛和平，世界上之一切戰爭糾紛，即可戳止。」相反，馬克斯主義唯物論，則帶「世界上之若干憎恨與仇視」。他又形容「香港為世界上最美城市之一，為因香港目下所處之環境，彼希望其能成為亞洲靈性復興之出發點」。\n\n當晚佈道會約有4萬人出席，濟滿南華會球場及政府大球場，並有4000人回應呼召決志相信。當晚九廣鐵路更特別加開夜班火車。\n\n\n其後，葛培理於1975及1990年，亦親臨香港主領大型佈道會。1990年時香港浸會學院頒發榮譽博士學位予。\n\n\n(5) 基督教公民運動 1956（倪鑑輝1966）\n\n\n1956年，在何明華主教推動下，香港基督教協進會常務委員會通過成立「基督教公民運動小組委員會」（下稱委員會），運動的目標包括：（1）促進社會問題的研究，和基督教信仰對這些問題所能給予的解答；（2）增進市民在日常生活中的責任感；（3）鼓勵眾教會及教會機構與信徒間的聯合行動，以反抗社會罪惡」。整個運動深信基督教信仰必須引導信徒在社區中過良好的倫理和道德生活，期望先在基督徒中間開始工作，再逐步推廣，使市民對公社的責任有新的醒覺。\n\n\n翌年，協進會印製「基督徒對社會的責任」單張，分派予89間教會及機構。委員會又在基督教中學舉辨演講及論文比賽，並倡議基督教中學及教會青年團契推行公民運動週。同時，又與麗的呼聲電台作作，邀請宗教領袖就公民運動議題製作廣播節目。\n\n\n1959年，聖公會何明華為運動撰寫《良好的基督徒應該是積極的公民嗎？給全香港基督徒的幾個新約聖經問題》，根據《馬太》《路加》《約翰》福音經文，幫助基督徒從「基督國度」反思如何關心社會（何明華1959）。\n\n\n1961年，委員會與《華僑日報》合辦「良好公民」攝影比賽，獲獎100幀相片於香港大會堂公開展覽。1962年，出版一套合共64幅《良好公民》漫畫集。1965年，訂下7月作「基督徒公民主日」，藉此在教會作推廣教導。\n\n\n委員會曾就下列社會議題，表達意見：聲援反對足球博彩合法化（1959）、上書政府反對外圍馬合法化（1964）、反對在九龍地區增酒吧數目（1966）、倡議反吸毒群眾運動（1966）等。\n\n\n (6) Actress Mui Yee Abandons Acting for Evangelism, 1959 (Xing Fuzeng, 2021a, 2021b)\n\n\nMui Yee (1923–1966), born Kong Tuen-Yee, was a native of Nanhai, Guangdong, born in Beijing. At the age of 7, she was baptized in a church in Shanghai, where her mother took her. Mui Yee lived in both Shanghai and Guangzhou and started her career as a child star. In 1937, she began acting in Hong Kong, starring in her first film, After Many Trials (1937), directed by her uncle, renowned playwright Kong Yu-Leung (also known as Nam Hoi Sup Sam Long). After World War II, she moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai and resumed her film career, appearing in over 70 movies, including Night in Shanghai (1931), Madame Butterfly (1948), Everlasting Regret (1948), The Family (1953), Sunrise (1953), Sisters of the Lotus (1954), Tragedy of the Rich (1956), The Lotus Lantern (1956), and The Feast of the Rich (1959).\n\n\nMui Yee’s renewed faith in Christ was inspired by fellow Christian actress Pak Suet Sin (Chow Kit Lin), leading her to attend the Evangelistic Academy of the China Evangelistic Mission, where she experienced spiritual rebirth. Reflecting on her past, she confessed:  \n\n\"Although I called myself a Christian, I lacked the life of Christ. I started acting at the age of six, living a life immersed in the illusions of drama, filled with pride, indulgence, and a relentless pursuit of fame and fortune. I was like a lost sheep, straying far from the path.\"\n\n\nIn late 1958, a severe gastric ulcer left Mui Yee bedridden for two months. During her illness, she tearfully confessed her sins to God. After her recovery, she became passionate about sharing the gospel and decided to leave the film industry, proclaiming:  \n\n\"Before the Lord, I resolve to abandon worldly ties and live as a pure bride for Him. No matter the joys or sufferings in this life, I am determined to walk the path of the cross.\"\n\n\nIn March 1959, she began hosting weekly home gospel gatherings. By September, during a filming scene that required her to dive into the sea, she felt that her old self, \"Mui Yee,\" was buried in the depths. Emerging from the water, she declared, \"The life I now live is no longer mine.\" Shortly afterward, she left the entertainment industry and began her evangelistic work, viewing the pulpit as her \"second stage.\" Mui Yee preached at churches across Hong Kong and Macau and was frequently invited to lead revival meetings, leveraging her fame to draw audiences.\n\n\nIn 1961, she was diagnosed with tongue cancer. Deciding to fully rely on her faith, she refused medical treatment. From July onward, she claimed to have been filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues. From May 1, 1962, to April 2, 1963, she entered a prayer chamber, fasting and praying while writing a 300,000-word manuscript titled Collected Sermons on Life. Her turn toward charismatic practices led to accusations of heresy from Hong Kong churches, who viewed her as influenced by \"evil spirits.\" In June and September of 1963, Mui Yee formed the \"Charismatic Evangelistic Mission\" and conducted successful but controversial preaching tours in Malaysia and Singapore. She argued for dismantling denominational structures and rebuilding a New Testament church aligned with God's will, also predicting a great revival in 1966. These positions were criticized by churches as divisive.\n\n\nMui Yee passed away in August 1966. Newspapers reported her death under headlines such as \"Extraordinary Actress Mui Yee Succumbs to Throat Cancer.\" Her funeral attracted attention for its unusual nature, as the funeral parlor was turned into a preaching venue. Mui Yee left behind several works, including Acts of the Holy Spirit (Volumes I and II), Golden Lampstands (Volumes I and II), The Book of Esther, Entering the Kingdom of God, Behold! The Glorious Works of God, and For the Sake of Defending Truth. After her death, some believers in Taiwan, inspired by her teachings, established a New Testament Church.\n\n(6) 影星梅綺棄影傳教1959（邢福增2021a, 2021b）\n\n\n梅綺（1923-1966），原名江端儀，廣東南海人，生於北京。7歲時在上海被母親帶教會領洗，先後在上海、廣州生活，並任童星。1937年在香港從影，首部演出電影是「百戰餘生」（1937），由叔父著名劇作家江譽鏐（南海十三郎）執導。戰後由上海來港重投電影曾演出電影合共七十多部，包括《夜上海》（1931）、《蝴蝶夫人》（1948）、《此恨綿綿無絕期》（1948）、《家》（1953）、《日出》（1953）、《金蘭姊妹》（1954）、《朱門怨》（1956）、《寶蓮燈》（1956）、《豪門夜宴》（1959）等等。\n\n\n由於另一位基督徒影星紫羅蓮（鄒潔蓮）關係，她重拾對基督的信仰，並參加中華傳道會培靈學院，得著重生。據她日後自述，「我自己雖名為教友，卻無基督的生命。」「在六歲時我就開始我的演戲生涯，真可以說：我一生是浸淫在水月鏡花，疑幻疑真的戲劇裡面。我一直在罪中過著驕、奢、淫、逸、爭名奪利的生活，真是如羊走迷，偏行己路。」1958年底，因胃潰瘍病而臥床兩個月，深感痛苦，在病中向神流淚認罪。病癒後，熱心傳道。後決定離開電影界，「在主前我今立志拋棄俗世塵緣，為祂作個貞潔童女，今生無論遇福遇苦，決心隨祂走十架路」。1959年3月，她開始家庭福音聚會，每周一次分享信仰。她9月，在拍攝電影中一跳海鏡頭後，她感到昔日的「梅綺」已埋葬在海底，浮出水面時，「如今活著的不再是我了」。自此，她即告別影藝事業，並開始講壇工作，並以此作「第二舞台」，在香港及澳門各教會佈道。由於江端儀原是著名影星，故獲很多教會邀請主領奮興佈道。\n\n\n1961確診舌癌後，江決定全心依靠信仰，不再尋求醫藥幫助。7月起，經歷聖靈充滿後，開始講方言。1962年5月1日至63年4月2日進入密室，禁食禱告，完成《生命證道集》30萬字。由於她開始轉向靈恩，故香港教會將其視作「異端」「邪靈」。1963年6 月及9月，組成「靈恩佈道團」，先後到星馬一帶佈道，深受信徒歡迎，但也引發爭議。除了靈恩傾向外，她又認為奉聖靈差遣要拆除人為的宗派組織，要重建合神心意新約教會。她又預言1966年有大復興。不過，這些批評宗派的主張被眾教會指為「分裂教會」。\n\n1966年8月，因病離世。報章以「藝海奇女子梅綺，患喉癌不治逝世」報導。出殯時也報導「梅綺遺言指定死後三天下葬，便可化作聖女」……「梅綺出殯儀式特別，殯儀館變成講道堂」……著有《聖靈行傳〉（上下集）、《金燈台》（二集）、《以斯帖記》、《進神的國》、《看啊！神榮耀的作為》、《我們為了辯明真理》等書。江離世後，有台灣信徒受其影響，建立新約教會。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Christian Anti-Gambling Movement  \n\n(Hing 2018b: 41-42)  \n\n\nIn 1960, a proposal to introduce football betting in Hong Kong prompted the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union to send a letter of strong opposition to the Governor and Legislative Council members. In 1964, the union actively opposed the establishment of a greyhound racing track and the legalization of illegal horse betting. Various Christian organizations, including the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union, the Hong Kong Christian Council, the YWCA, and the Hong Kong Christian Welfare and Relief Council, expressed firm opposition. Their advocacy pressured the government to heed public opinion and refrain from introducing new forms of gambling beyond those already permitted.  \n\n\nIn 1967, the union opposed a proposal by the New Territories Heung Yee Kuk to establish a greyhound racing track in the New Territories, further underscoring its consistent anti-gambling stance.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Inauguration of Christian Weekly  \n\n(Ng 2014: 108-112)  \n\n\nIn October 1963, the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union established a publication department led by Wong Tsok (Methodist Church) to prepare for the launch of Christian Weekly. The inaugural issue was published on August 30, 1964, featuring sections such as church news, sermons, family and women's issues, youth topics, and children's stories. The first print run of 30,000 copies was distributed to churches across Hong Kong for promotion.  \n\n\nIn the foreword, Wong Tsok articulated the paper’s mission: (1) reporting Christian news, (2) nurturing spiritual growth, and (3) spreading Christian truths. Editorial guidelines included:  \n\n1. Content must relate to Christianity and align with the Bible and the union's constitution.  \n\n2. Avoid political involvement.  \n\n3. Refrain from attacking other religions, denominations, organizations, or individuals.  \n\n4. Avoid emphasizing denominational distinctions.  \n\n5. Promote truth and oppose sin.  \n\n6. Prioritize constructive content.  \n\n7. Correct errors in citations, grammar, and plagiarism.  \n\n\nChristian Weekly was Hong Kong’s first weekly Christian publication for all churches, serving as a platform for expressing the union's views. Special issues addressed significant topics such as the \"Anti-Corruption Movement\" (1977), \"Anti-Pornography Campaign\" (1979), \"Opposition to Legalizing Homosexuality\" (1981), and \"Opposition to Expanding Jockey Club Betting Shops\" (1983).  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Hong Kong Christian Response to the 1966 Riots  \n\n\nIn response to the Kowloon disturbances triggered by fare increases on the Star Ferry, Rev. David C. P. Lew of the Church of Christ in China wrote a commentary titled Opposition to Price Hikes! Opposition to Riots! in the April 24, 1966, issue of Christian Weekly. Lew acknowledged the motives of the peaceful protesters but lamented the violence and looting that ensued, which he deemed contrary to Christ’s teachings of peace. His reflections included:  \n\n1. All forms of violence are wrong.  \n\n2. Opposition to price hikes is justified.  \n\n3. Public sentiment should be taken seriously.  \n\n4. Education policies must be reviewed, as the riots exposed issues among Hong Kong’s youth, including the shortcomings of the education system and its neglect of moral and social awareness.  \n\n\nOn May 15, Christian Weekly published Ho Tin-yau’s article The Church Cannot Ignore Social Issues Facing Youth, which emphasized the seriousness of youth-related issues revealed by the riots. Ho urged churches to adopt a prophetic stance to address youth delinquency and to strengthen youth ministry through publications, Sunday schools, recreation centers, and industrial evangelism.  \n\n\nOn May 22, Paul R. Webb of the Hong Kong Christian Welfare Union attributed the riots to changes over the preceding two decades, including population growth, industrial development, materialism, inadequate child education, and existential uncertainty among Hong Kong residents due to unclear political status. He urged churches to take responsibility for addressing these societal issues.  \n\n\nOverall, the Christian response mirrored the government’s inquiry into the riots, recognizing deeper societal and youth-related issues.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) Hong Kong Christian Response to the 1967 Riots  \n\n(Hing 2018b: 82-86)  \n\n\nInitially sparked by labor strikes, the 1967 riots led to early Christian responses focusing on labor disputes. The Christian Industrial Committee of the Hong Kong Christian Council called for an independent investigation into the strikes and emphasized the need for all parties to prioritize societal welfare.  \n\n\nAs the unrest escalated, Anglican Bishop Gilbert Baker issued a pastoral letter on May 8, urging citizens to uphold \"peace and order\" and calling for mutual responsibility between employers and employees. He also stressed the church’s role in addressing youth issues and building a harmonious society.  \n\n\nOn May 22, the Hong Kong Christian Council Executive Committee issued a public appeal for peace and social order, discouraging youth from participating in disruptive actions. The Church of Christ in China’s Hong Kong Council also issued a statement, lamenting the violence and urging the government to address labor disputes and youth issues.  \n\n\nThe 1968-69 annual report of the Hong Kong Christian Council reflected on the riots, noting a renewed church focus on societal dynamics and a stronger commitment to addressing social challenges, particularly those affecting youth.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) EACC’s Faith and Order Conference, 1966  \n\n(Christian Weekly, 1966b, 1966c, 1966d)  \n\n\nThe East Asia Christian Conference (EACC) held its first Faith and Order Consultation in Hong Kong from October 26 to November 3, 1966, at the Methodist Church’s Kowloon Chapel. The conference, themed Confessing Christianity in Asia Today, featured speakers such as Huang Tsang Hui, Visser 't Hooft, and D. T. Niles.  \n\n\nThe conference issued a declaration emphasizing the \"independence and autonomy\" of Asian churches and the importance of interpreting God’s work within Asian contexts, avoiding reliance on Western doctrinal frameworks. This marked the beginning of \"confessing theology,\" which laid the foundation for the development of Asian Theology in the 1970s.  \n\n\nThe EACC, established in 1957 in Indonesia, was renamed the Christian Conference of Asia in 1973.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) Ecumenical Practices Between Christianity and Catholicism  \n\n(Fu 2018: 101-106, 110)  \n\n\nThe ecumenical movement between Hong Kong Christians and Catholics was significantly influenced by the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). Before the council, cooperation was primarily non-religious. For instance, in 1960, the Catholic Diocese joined Protestant groups, such as the Anglican Church and the Methodist Church, on the RTHK Chinese Religious Broadcasting Advisory Committee to produce programs.  \n\n\nPost-Vatican II, ecumenical dialogue intensified. In 1966, the Catholic Diocese established the Christian Unity Committee and introduced annual Week of Prayer for Christian Unity services. Joint Bible study and prayer meetings were organized, and in 1969, clergy from both traditions began exchanging pulpits.  \n\n\nIn 1968, the Catholic Diocese and the Hong Kong Bible Society explored producing a jointly approved Chinese Bible translation. However, disagreements over terminology (e.g., \"God\" vs. \"Lord\") ultimately ended the collaboration. Despite this, ecumenical efforts continued, fostering greater mutual understanding and cooperation.  \n\n(1)基督教反賭博運動（邢福增2018b：41-42）\n\n\n1960年有建議在香港舉辦足球博彩，當時華人基督教聯會即致函港督及各立法局議員，表達強烈反對。1964年，聯會積極反對開設賽狗場。同年，有人建議外圍馬合法化，眾多基督教團體，如華人基督教聯會、香港基督教協進會、基督教女青年會、香港基督教福利與救濟協會等，均表達堅決反對的立場，最終逼使政府接納民意，除現有已准許的賭博外，不再增加任何方式的賭博。到1967年，聯會又反對新界鄉議局請求政府在新界設跑狗場的議案。\n\n\n(2)《基督教週報》創刊Christian Weekly, 1964（吳思源2014：108-112）\n\n\n1963年10月，香港華人基督教聯會成立出部版，由黃作（循道公會）任部長，並籌備出版《基督教週報》。1964年8月30日，《週報》創刊號面世，內容包括：教會消息、宣道講章、家庭婦女、青年園地、兒童故事等。首期印備3萬份，分贈全港各教會，以廣宣傳之用。黃作牧師在〈創刊詞〉中，申明《週報》的宗旨有三：「報導基督教消息，培育基督徒靈性，和宣揚基督教真理」。至於編寫要則方面，則包括：（一）文字圖片要與基督教有關，根據聖經及本會憲章為立場；（二）不介入政治；（三）不攻擊任何宗教、宗派、機構或個人；（四）不強調各宗派特點；（五）宣揚真理，與罪惡宣戰；（六）重視建設性文字；（七）注意修正各種文字立論與引用或字句之錯誤及抄襲來之文章。\n\n\n《基督教週刊》是香港首份由基督教出版，面向全港教會的週報。作為聯會出版之刊物，也成為表達聯會立場之平台，如曾出版「反罪惡運動」專號（1977）、「反黃專號」（1979）、「反同性戀合法化」（1981）、「反馬會廣設投注站」（1983）等。\n\n\n(3) 香港基督教對六六暴動的回應\n\n\n1966年中華基督教會劉治平牧師在4月24日《基督教週報》撰寫題為〈反加價！反暴亂！〉的「評論」，回應因天星小輪加價引發的九龍騷動事件。他首先指出「不否定反加價青年絕食示威的動機」，但卻對「和平的示威演變成破壞和搶掠」感到可惜，認為這是有違「耶穌基督和平的教訓」。他又從四方面來反思：（一）一切暴力的行為，都是不對的；（二）我們反對加價；（三）希望輿情能被重視，因為市民的聲音被忽視；（四）要重新檢討教育政策。因為暴動反映出香港青年問題：教育制度的不完滿、填鴨式、金字塔、沒有重視人格教育，認識社會問題。他呼籲當局加強「公民責任」及「道德的訓練」（劉治平1966）。\n\n\n5月15日，《基督教週報》再刊登何天佑的〈教會不能忽視的社會青年問題〉來回應六六暴動，指「參加的大部分是青年份子，他們的行為和因暴亂所產生的後果，這事實就反映著今日香港青年問題的嚴重」。對於青年犯罪問題，他指教會「應具先知的精神予以揭發指責及糾正，教會本身不應以獨善其身為滿足」。他又呼籲教會加強青年事工，例如發行刊物、青年主日學校、青年康樂中心、工業佈道、接受求助資詢小組等。最後重申教會必須接受社會青年問題的挑戰，不應以逃避態度面對（何天佑1966）。\n\n\n5月22日，基督教服務聯會主任華元博（Paul R. Webb）以〈今日香港市民的家庭生活問題〉回應騷亂，指其乃源於「近二十年來所有的變動」，包括：人口增加、商業、工業發展下的家庭問題；物質需求；生活缺乏保障；兒童教育不足等。他又特別強調，香港人正面對「政治未明朗、市民不斷懷疑他們所屬是誰？香港？中國？這時政治上的疑問使他們徬徨，在香港不敢作久居」的困惑。他最後指出，「這些轉變和困難激發教會和我們的心，加倍對意我們對眾人的責任。教會不應「袖手旁觀」，回應「自己未盡之責任」（華元元博1966）。\n\n\n總的而言，香港教會在六六暴動後的反思，跟香港政府事後成立的調查委員會報告的觀點接近，即承認暴動「揭露一項更意義深遠和更複雜的問題」，特別是探討青年人參與暴動的成因（）。\n\n\n(4) 香港基督教對六七暴動的回應（邢福增2018b：82-86）\n\n\n六七暴動最初因工潮誘發，故勞資矛盾成為教會方面最早的回應重點。香港基督教協進會工業委員會呼籲政府就工業糾紛作獨立調查。聲明也不諱言指出，工潮的本質並不單純，已滲入其他政治因素在內。故工委會希望「那些利用此等糾紛作其他目的的人士」，應把社會整體「安定和福利」為重。最後，則提出各方要「共同磋商謀求除去存在社會之不公義、不安全的因素」，讓工友能夠過合理的生活。\n\n\n及至騷亂惡化，聖公會白約翰會督（Gilbert Baker）於5月8日發表致教友書，文告指：「安寧與秩序」是社會所必要維持的，公民須遵守法律，愛鄰如己。此外，他又呼籲勞資共濟，資方要給予勞方合理待遇，而勞方亦要其他工友負有責任。再者，教會要關心青年，並肯定「青年人所理想追求不受種族階級國籍限制之社會已實現於教會中」。最後，他重申「上帝呼召吾人同心建立一個更完善之香港」，如果並未回應上帝之呼召，並檢討當前社會的組織，吾人應「祈求赦免與更新」。\n\n\n5月22日，基督教協進會執委召開會議，就近日「因騷動所形容是次乃「社會危機」並發出公開呼籲：支持維持和平及社會秩序，又呼籲青少年「切勿參與任何足以引起社會安寧解體的行動，庶免觸犯法律與秩序為盼」。5月下旬，中華基督教會香港區會以全體牧師名義發表聲明：（一）對「由輕微之人造花廠勞資糾紛事件演變而為影響整個市民和平生活，以及嚴重打擊工商業之騷動」，表達深切遺憾；（二）擁護政府維持治安的措施；（三）建議擴大輔警組織，防止騷動再起，基督徒應予參與；（四）基督徒應贊助警員子女高等教育基金；（五）政府應本「勞資兩利」原則，解決有關勞資糾紛，「廉價勞工並非一定有利本港工業發展」；（六）不應忽視青少年問題；（七）香港市民不分種族、宗教及政治信仰，應彼此尊重，和平共處，努力建設民主幸福的社會。\n\n\n基督教協進會在1968至69年的《年報》，亦對六七暴動作出回應：「自動亂後，本港眾教會似已更關懷社區的動態。一般而言，教會經已注重對社會的責任。這可從眾教會及眾志願團體就今日本港青年問題的挑戰所作的積極反應見之。」\n\n\n香港華人基督教聯會未有直接回應。惟其出版的《基督教週報》，在5月28日發表以「天佑」署名，題為〈發揚人性，消弭禍患〉的「短評」，側面地回應六七暴動，指「在古今的歷史時件裡，我們也同樣看到不少抹殺人性，殘忍醜惡的行徑。」因此，「當前世界人類的禍福安危，決定的因素，就得看人類的抉擇如何？我們願走神的道路，發揚聖善仁愛的神性，好得肖乎上帝，建設天國於人間。抑或我們甘心走入魔鬼的圈套，而成為魔鬼的工具呢？」在當前這個「動亂不安的世代中」，「戰爭殺戮正催迫人類走向自我毀滅的緊急關頭」，他深信，「發揮人性，是消弭禍患悲劇的唯一的途徑」，基督教更當「力行倡導」，「以挽救人類所面臨的悲慘劫運」。\n\n\n總括而言，香港教會界的公開回應及評論：（一）將社會矛盾及暴動置於廣泛的人性及罪性問題來理解，並未有直接觸及問題的核心與根源，《基督教週報》的評論正屬此類；（二）從「勞資糾紛」的角度切入，呼籲雙方克制及協商；政府亦應介入調查，藉此處理勞資矛盾。針對騷亂，教會則積極支持政府，期望社會盡早恢復穩定局面。基督教協進會、工委會、聖公會及中華基督教會香港區會的回應，可歸入此類。\n\n\n(5) 東亞基督教會議「信仰與教制」大會在香港召開 1966（基督教週報1966 b, 1966 c, 1966 d）\n\n\n東亞基督教會議（East Asia Christian Conference, EACC）主辦第一屆「信仰與教制」大會（Hong Kong Consultation on Faith and Order）於1966年10月26日至11月3日，在中華循道公會九龍堂舉行。大會總題是「今日亞洲基督教之宣信」，講員包括黃彰輝、何輔德、麥佐恩、善美杜斌、叔夏禮、韋路加等。10月30日，於大會堂舉辦「亞洲宣信大會」，由普世教會協會前任總幹事何輔德（Visser t'Hcoft ）、東亞基督教協會總幹事聶樂瑞（Daniel Thambyrajah Niles），印度聯合神學院陳德寧作專題講題。\n\n\n大會發表〈今日亞洲基督教之宣信〉宣言，提及亞洲基督會的「獨立自主」，又指要從亞洲的處境（文化、宗教、革命）去了解上帝的工作時，要小心不要將西方教會的「成文教條」視作絕對，否則就不能「發現上帝在基督裡在亞洲生活之中可能啟示我們的真理之新的深度」。大會倡議的「宣信神學」（Confessing theology），肇始了七十年代亞洲神學（Asian Theology）的出現。\n\n\n東亞基督教議會於1957年於印尼成立，1973年更名為亞洲基督教議會（Christian Conference of Asia）。\n\n\n (6) 基督教與天主教的合一實踐（傅俊濠 2018：101-106、110）\n\n\n毋庸置疑，香港天主教與基督教的「合一」，跟1962至65年間召開的天主教梵蒂岡第二次大公會議（梵二）有密切關係。不過，早於梵二前，天主教香港教區在1960年便應香港電台邀請，與聖公會、循道公會、中華基督教會與港區會及浸信會組成「香港電台中文宗教廣播顧問委員會」（RTHK Chinese Religious Broadcasting Advisory Committee），香港教區與基督教協進會亦加入「香港電台英語宗教廣播顧問委員會」（The Religious Broadcasting  and Television Advisory Committee），兩個委員會分別負責製作中文及英文的宗教廣播節目，如「天降甘霖」、「豐富的人生」、「Church Service」等。可見，梵二前雙方主要以非宗教平台開展合作。\n\n\n梵二後，雙方更積極地展開對話。1966年1月，天主教香港教區成立「基督徒合一委員會」，並於1969年出版《香港教區合一運動指南》。1964年，聖公會與天主教香港教區開始推行基督徒合一祈禱週，其後改由香港教區與協進會於每年1月18至25日舉行。合一崇拜於聖公會聖約翰座堂舉行，崇拜中設聯合聖餐禮。1966年，教區與協進會在大會堂舉行聯合研經和祈禱會，由雙方神職人員誦讀和講解經文，其後雙方繼續聯合主辦研經大會，互派講員宣講。1969年，聖公會與天主教香港教區司鐸首次進行交換講壇，前往對方的教堂講道。類似的合一聚會，也在地區進行。例如元朗聖伯多祿聖保祿堂與區內新教團體在1969年2月舉行合一聖經誦讀會，並由聖公會牧師講道，交換講壇得以在地區層次展開。\n\n\n1968年，天主教白英奇（Lorenzo Bianchi）主教委託香港思高聖經學會與香港聖經公會商討合作，同意雙方機構發售後此出版的《聖經》，雙方宗派可共同舉行「聖經主日」，雙方繼續密切研討，尋求一種為雙方同意採用的中文《聖經》譯名。天主教亦派2名代表任聖經公會諮詢委員會委員。不過，由於天主教無法放棄「天主」而改稱「上帝」，最後天主教與基督教的《聖經》合譯計劃絛疾而終。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) The Five-Year Plan of the Hong Kong and Macau Diocese of the Anglican Church (1970–1975)  \n\n(龐德明, 1970)  \n\n\nThe Five-Year Plan (1970–1975), released by the Hong Kong and Macau Diocese during Bishop Baker's tenure, marked the first strategic development initiative for the Anglican Church. It addressed challenges posed by industrialization and secularization in Hong Kong during the 1970s, noting that \"the political turbulence of 1967 and subsequent migrations, combined with rapid economic recovery and changing policies, necessitate a fundamental reevaluation of church strategy for the decade.\"  \n\n\nThe second chapter emphasized the Church's mission to \"serve non-Christians in secular society\" and highlighted the importance of relating the Gospel to contemporary social issues, particularly youth engagement. The third chapter focused on education, noting that only one-third of primary school graduates advanced to secondary school in 1969. The diocese proposed establishing technical schools alongside grammar schools and enhancing Bible studies within its educational programs.  \n\n\nThe fourth chapter addressed social welfare, acknowledging persistent poverty in Hong Kong despite economic prosperity. The diocese planned to reorganize its Social Welfare Committee to expand its work. The fifth chapter focused on labor, criticizing outdated labor laws and the ineffectiveness of arbitration in resolving disputes. It identified the fragmentation of trade unions into leftist, rightist, and neutral factions as a weakness and called for greater contributions in \"industrial welfare\" beyond general social services.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Mission Consultation Meetings of the Hong Kong Christian Council, 1970 and 1971  \n\n(香港基督教協進會, 1971a, 1971b)  \n\n\nIn January 1970, the Hong Kong Christian Council convened a consultation meeting titled \"The Mission of the Hong Kong Church,\" attended by over 120 representatives from various denominations. The discussions focused on the state of Hong Kong churches, societal challenges, and new directions for the Church’s mission.  \n\n\nReverend Lee Ching-chi criticized the Church for being \"self-contented, inward-looking, and immature in education and action.\" The meeting underscored the interconnection between evangelism, education, and social service. Father Francis Cooray highlighted that faith for many Christians was limited to personal morality, disconnected from work, social issues, or Hong Kong's future.  \n\n\nA follow-up meeting in January 1971 emphasized the Church’s role as an institution of \"social justice and service.\" It called for the development of theological understanding of \"justice\" and \"development\" and advocated fostering \"social consciousness\" among citizens. Despite the meetings’ insightful reflections, the Council’s General Secretary, Kwok Nai-hung, noted the lack of follow-up, leaving the proposed actions unimplemented.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Ordination of Women Priests in the Anglican Church, 1971  \n\n(周舒燕, 黃慧貞, 2018: 136-139, 144-153; 黃羨雲, 1983: 6)  \n\n\nIn 1969, the Hong Kong and Macau Diocese of the Anglican Church considered a proposal from Holy Trinity Church to ordain women priests. Bishop Baker supported the proposal and sought broader consultation, issuing a pastoral letter explaining the rationale for ordination.  \n\n\nIn January 1970, the diocesan council voted on the proposal, with 67 in favor, 8 against, and 17 abstentions. Although the motion required approval from the Council of the Church of South-East Asia (CCSEA) and the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC), Bishop Baker interpreted their responses as conditional approval and proceeded with ordinations in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nOn November 28, 1971, Bishop Baker ordained Joyce Bennett and Jane Huang as priests, making them the first women priests in the global Anglican Communion.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China's \"Clean Hong Kong Campaign,\" 1972  \n\n(基督教週報, 1972a; 香港區會, 1972)  \n\n\nTo commemorate the 130th anniversary of Protestant Christianity in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China launched the \"Clean Hong Kong Campaign\" from September 1972 to August 1973. The campaign promoted environmental, mental, and moral cleanliness under the theme \"We Want to Survive.\"  \n\n\nThe campaign identified three key goals: cultivating a sense of belonging to Hong Kong, raising awareness of social responsibility, and inspiring meaningful living amidst a deteriorating society. It organized group discussions to address issues such as corruption, education reform, social welfare, and housing. Recommendations included mandatory six-year primary and three-year secondary education, improved housing policies, and stricter anti-corruption measures.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Christian Opposition to Legalized Betting on Dog Racing, 1973  \n\n(華僑日報, 1973a, 1973b; 教聲, 1973)  \n\n\nIn August 1973, the Hong Kong Christian Council issued a public letter opposing the government’s plan to legalize dog racing betting. The council argued that legalization would encourage idleness, hinder social development, and negatively influence youth.  \n\n\nIn September, the Hong Kong and Macau Diocese of the Anglican Church also opposed the plan, stating that legalizing illegal activities would not eliminate social problems and would encourage speculative behavior. Despite opposition, the government introduced legal betting mechanisms in subsequent years, including the launch of the Mark Six lottery in 1976 and the enactment of the Gambling Ordinance in 1977.\n\n(1)聖公會港澳教區《五年計劃書（1970至1975）》（龐德明1970）\n\n\n聖公會港澳教區發表《五年計劃書（1970至1975）》，這是白約翰會督（Bishop Baker）任內首個教會發展企劃，為聖公會的發展奠下重要方向。計劃書指陳聖公會在步入七十年代時面對的挑戰，特別是工業化及世俗化。報告認為，「一九六七年的政局動盪和部份市民隨後的遷徒異地，本港經濟的迅速復原及其他施政方針的改變，假若教會要在二十世紀七○年代的首十年向前邁進的話，我們得把教會的策略作一些基本的重新思考是需要的」。\n\n\n第二章的以聖公會未來的任務為主題，提出教會要「為世俗社會的非基督徒作更大的服務」，強調「福音必須與當代社會的問題發生關聯」。同時，又表達對青少年工作的重視。第三章的重點是教育：指出在1969年內只有三分之一的小學畢業生可以升上中學。因此，教區除了繼續主辦文法中學外，也應設立以技術訓練為中的工業學校。同時，教區學校要加強聖經科的教導，教會應在「學校靈性生活」方面，作更大的貢獻。第四章有關社會福利政策方面，報告承認在繁榮富裕的香港，仍存在貧窮問題。教區將改組社會福利委員會，繼續投入社會福利工作。第五章以教會與工業為中心，明確指出現有的勞工法是「不合時宜」，在處理勞資糾紛方面，也「沒有一套有效的仲裁方法來解決爭端」。同時，工會組織又分為「左派、右派和中立派」，因而「顯得力量微弱」。因此，教會除了關心一般的「社會福利」外，應在「工業福利」方面作出更多的貢獻。\n\n\n(2) 香港基督教協進會使命諮詢會議1970, 1971 (香港基督教協進會 1971a, 1971b)\n\n\n1970年1月19至20日，香港基督教協進會召開以「香港教會的使命」為主題的諮詢會議，共120多人代表各宗派參加。會議的重點包括：（一）香港教會的現狀；（二）正視香港面臨的挑戰；（三）提供教會使命新路向。李清詞在會上，毫不客氣地批評香港教會的「故步自封」、「自我中心，內傾態度」、「教育膚淺，行動幼稚」等問題。會議確認傳福音、教育與服務的見證間，有著密切的關係。天主教的區成賢神父在會議上指出，不論在天主教徒或基督徒中，信仰只不過關乎個人道德，與工作生活、社會問題以至香港前途無關。教友很少在教會中獲得將信仰應用於工作環境的指導與鼓勵。\n\n\n為進一步商討實際行動，協進會於1971年1月召開第二屆諮詢會議。陳佐才在會議批評基督教的社會關懷，只集中在個別機構（如基督教工業委員會）身上，許多教友不論在經濟或行動上卻鮮有承擔。其中「香港城市事工」組一致主張，教會是「社會關懷與服務和愛的機構」，並以「社會公義」與「社會服務」去實踐教會的責任。同時，教會應協助市民發展「社會意識」，探討「發展」及「社會公義」的神學。1970及71年兩次使命諮詢會議，具有相當的時代觸覺，並提出頗全面的路向反思。不過，據協進會總幹事郭乃弘指出，由於協進會缺乏同工跟進，無法將會議的成果付諸實行。\n\n\n(3) 香港聖公會按立女牧師 1971（周舒燕、黃慧貞2018：136-139，144-153；黃羨雲1983：6）\n\n\n1969年港澳教區籌備大會，邀請各教區提出議案以便討論。聖三一堂提議港澳教區應按立女牧師。白約翰會督在1969年12月教區會議上，希望就此提案作深入研究，將該案押後至1970年1月「延會」再討論。他特別發表〈女牧師一職〉的中英文牧函，闡述按立女牧師的理據。他又寫信給坎特伯里大主教藍賽（Arthur M. Ramsey）：「香港是聖公會按立女牧師最可能實現的地方之一」。1970年1月，教區議會就按立女牧師一事投票，出席議會議員92名，贊成者67名，反對者8名，棄權者17名。白約翰指出，此事仍須徵詢東南亞地區議會及普世聖公宗諮詢協會之意見（白約翰1970）。\n\n\n1971年2月，普世聖公宗諮詢協會召開，最後以24票贊成22票反對的微弱優勢，通過第28號決議，內容包括：（1）世界各地聖公會考慮按立女牧師，並於1973年提出意見；（2）如果會督獲得所在地教省准許，其所按立女牧師可為普世聖公宗接受；（3）按立女牧師一事，應由普世聖公宗諮詢議會秘書長提請聖公會與其他教會商議後卞1973年議會具覆。由於決議具有若干含糊性，既提及只要教省同意即可，但另又設定1973年作決定。對此，白約翰理解為可行，乃於4月將按立女牧師提案交東南亞教區議會（Council of the Church of South-East Asia, CCSEA），但CCSEA卻以「保留意見」來處理。1971年6月，CCSEA負責人周萬一主教回覆白約翰，按聖公宗諮詢會議決議，應待1973年後再考慮按立，又指當下按立會造成教會分裂。此時，香港聖公會內也出現反對按立女牧師的聲音。不過，白約翰卻不為所動，表明根據聖公宗諮詢會議決議來按立女牧師。11月，白將按立名單寄近坎特伯里大主教，後者回覆時既提醒他反對按立的理由，但卻沒有明確表示反對。\n\n\n1971年11月28日，白約翰會督祝聖黃羨雲及英國聖公會差會 (CMS)傳教士班佐時（Joyce Bennett）為牧師，成為普世聖公宗首批按立的女牧師。\n\n\n(4) 中華基督教會香港區會舉行「清潔香港運動」1972（基督教週報1972a；香港區會1972）\n\n\n為慶祝基督教在香港開基130周年，中華基督教會香港區會於1972年9月至1973年8月間，推行「清潔香港運動」，目的是提倡「環境清潔，思想清潔，生活清潔」。該會總幹事汪彼得指出，環境、思想及生活三者間具有連貫性。在香港這樣的工業城市，要清潔環境，必先從思想著手，使市民注意公德心，更進一步使人在思想上認清貪污，作偽，色情等問題，在生活上提倡節儉，和睦鄰居，徹底實行基督的教訓。\n\n\n運動以「我們要生存」為宣傳主題，期盼以三個月為限（1972年9月至12月），使香港市民認識三個基本問題：（1）依存感：對現在生存的地方產生一種依存意識；（2）責任感：福音對社會責任；（3）生活感：感覺到生活有意義，即或在日趨敗壞社會中，仍願負起責任去改善。自1973年1月起，舉行分組討論會，深入了解香港社會各種問題，彙集討論結果，綜合意見，形成基督徒對社會的輿論。涉及問題包括：爭取市民應有的權利\n\n、要求政府作長遠計劃、要求政府採溫和社會主義實現人民幸福、把香港建成國際性城市\n\n謀求經濟發展與繁榮、建立健全社會福利制度、要求政府徹底清查各機關冗員及浪費現象、要求行政立法兩局應有民選議員名額、要求立即實行小學六年，中學三年的免費教育、要求修訂法律以維護治安與社會秩序、從速加建廉租及分層住宅、立例嚴厲清除貪污，成立直接向港督負責之反貪部門、要求政府制止放影色情及打鬥電影電視，消除黃色架步，黃色刊物、要求市民服裝端正，婦女尤應放棄暴露服裝、志願團體籌辦青少年活動，發展職業訓練、要求政府立例，維持環境衛生。\n\n\n(5) 基督教協進會及聖公會反對外圍狗馬合法化 1973（華僑日報1973a，1973b；教聲1973）\n\n\n1973年8月，香港基督教協進會以主席（高苕華）及署理總幹事（陳佐才）名義發表公開信，就政府有意將外圍狗馬合法化的政策，表達反對：（1）合法化有鼓勵市民不勞而勞之嫌，不利香港社會健康發展；（2）合法化反映政府不能斷然大刀闊斧對付社會罪惡，如果認同姑息政策可解決問題，則政府又如何應對其他社會罪惡問題（如吸毒、娼妓）？（3）合法化對青少年的負面影響，政府不應忽視。有關消息，亦獲中文報章轉載報導（如《華僑日報》1973年8月6日、8月20日）。\n\n\n9月，聖公會港澳教區常備委員會亦發表聲明，對外圍賭博合法化的問題，持「堅決反對」意見：（1）將不法變為合法，不能減除社會罪惡；（2）合法化代表政府無能撲滅回惡；（3）合法化的稅收可用作社會福利工作之用，但由此引起的災害（家庭糾紛）實屬得不償失；（4）合法化會增加市民投機取巧之心；（5）外圍賭博合法化不能鏟除貪污及非法賭博；（6）政府應慎重考慮民間反對意見。\n\n\n香港政府為打擊非法賭博及字花活動，於1976年由香港賽馬會推出「六合彩」，成為香港合法的彩票。立法局又於1977年通過賭博條例，重罰開賭及參與者。投注彩池除用作派彩外，餘額撥交獎券基金用作慈善用途。\n\n\n (6) Billy Graham Crusade, 1975  \n\n(基督教週報, 1975; 高潔, 1975)  \n\n\nFrom November 12 to 16, 1975, Billy Graham held a five-day crusade at the Government Stadium and South China Athletic Association Ground in Hong Kong. This marked his second crusade in Hong Kong, following his first visit in 1956. Upon arrival on November 8, Graham was welcomed at Queen's Pier in Central. A ceremony at Edinburgh Place featured speeches by Bishop Baker and Pastor Chang You Kwong.  \n\n\nThroughout the event, Graham conducted daily \"Evangelism Workshop Seminars\" at Kowloon City Baptist Church, sharing strategies with local pastors and leaders. In a press conference, Graham expressed willingness to hold a crusade in mainland China if invited. When asked about the compatibility of the Gospel with China's political system, he stated that the Gospel transcends all systems and emphasized that only Jesus Christ could address humanity’s problems of sin, suffering, and death.  \n\n\nThe crusade attracted over 223,000 attendees over five days, with more than 20,000 making commitments to faith. The Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union organized the event, holding monthly prayer meetings and mobilization efforts, including publicity campaigns under the theme \"Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\"  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (7) First Chinese Congress on World Evangelization (CCOWE), 1976  \n\n(林來蔚, 1990)  \n\n\nIn August 1976, the First CCOWE convened in Hong Kong under the theme \"Vision and Mission.\" Over 1,600 Chinese church leaders from more than 20 countries attended. The conference passed two major resolutions: establishing a permanent body to promote the Chinese Evangelization Movement and holding a CCOWE every five years.  \n\n\nThe event led to the founding of the Chinese Coordination Centre of World Evangelization (CCOWE) in Hong Kong in October 1976. Inspired by the Lausanne Congress of 1974, Chinese delegates at that conference envisioned CCOWE as a platform to address issues such as church growth and mission work. Donald McGavran’s Church Growth Theory was introduced, and CCOWE began publishing materials like Understanding Missions (1978) and the journal Contemporary Chinese Church.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (8) \"I Found It!\" Campaign, 1977–78  \n\n(高潔, 1977; 基督教週報, 1978)  \n\n\nOriginating in the United States, the \"I Found It!\" evangelistic campaign was introduced to Hong Kong by Campus Crusade for Christ in 1977. Aimed at sharing the Gospel with all 4.5 million residents, the campaign mobilized churches and volunteers under the slogan \"I Found It!\"  \n\n\nThe campaign included training programs, 24-hour prayer events, phone evangelism, and personal outreach efforts. Over six days, volunteers handled more than 91,000 calls, and large-scale rallies culminated in over 28,000 conversions.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (9) Hong Kong for Christ Campaign, 1977–78  \n\n(高潔, 1976; 1978b)  \n\n\nThe Hong Kong Baptist Convention launched the \"Hong Kong for Christ\" campaign as part of the Southern Baptist Convention’s \"Major City Evangelization\" initiative. With the theme \"New Life, New Things,\" the campaign involved evangelistic rallies, music events, and personal outreach efforts over two years.  \n\n\nThe campaign concluded with a five-night rally at the Boundary Street Municipal Stadium in November 1978, led by John Bisagno, with 1,100 attendees making commitments. In total, over 40 evangelistic events were held during this period.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (10) Chapel of Epiphany at Kai Tak Airport, 1979  \n\n(教聲, 1979)  \n\n\nOn January 27, 1979, the Chapel of Epiphany, the first airport chapel in Asia, was consecrated at Kai Tak Airport. Bishop Baker of the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau and Cardinal Wu Cheng-chung of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong officiated the ceremony. The chapel was designed as a quiet space for reflection and prayer for airport staff and travelers, with its premises provided by the Civil Aviation Department and renovations funded by various church organizations.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (11) Vietnamese Refugees and the Hong Kong Christian Community, 1975–1998  \n\n(陳天權, 2021; 梁家麟, 1999; 基督教週報, 1979a–e; SCMP, 1979)  \n\n\nThe end of the Vietnam War in 1975 triggered a large-scale refugee crisis, with thousands fleeing Vietnam. In 1978 and 1979, ships carrying over 2,000 refugees arrived in Hong Kong waters. Initially, the Hong Kong government denied entry, but humanitarian concerns led to temporary accommodations in refugee camps. By 1979, Hong Kong became a \"first asylum port\" under an international agreement, receiving over 68,000 refugees that year and more than 100,000 in 1980.  \n\n\nChristian organizations, including the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC) and the Christian Service, played a key role in relief efforts. The HKCC urged international churches to lobby their governments to accept more refugees. Locally, churches organized relief programs, including language training, vocational education, and spiritual care.  \n\n\nThe evangelical community also engaged in missionary activities within the camps, with gospel events and Sunday school programs. However, activists like So Yan Pui criticized the systemic injustices underlying the refugee crisis, urging Christians to advocate for a more humane world.  \n\n\nBetween 1975 and 1998, Hong Kong received approximately 200,000 Vietnamese refugees. Of these, 143,000 were resettled in third countries, 72,000 were repatriated, and 1,400 were allowed to remain in Hong Kong.\n\n(6) 葛培理佈道大會 Billy Graham Crusade 1975（基督教週報1975；高潔1975）\n\n\n1975年11月12至16日，葛培理在政府大球場及南華會球場舉行一連五天的佈道會。這是繼1956年後，葛再度來港主領佈道會。葛氏於11月8日乘航班飛抵香港後，再轉乘小輪在中環皇后碼頭登岸。隨即於愛丁堡廣場舉行歡迎儀式，由白約翰會督及張有光牧師致詞。10月上午，前往拜會港督麥理浩，下午有公開記者會，當晚又有通宵祈禱會。五天佈道會期間，每日於九龍城浸信會舉行「佈道事工研討會」，由葛培理及其他同工講述佈道事工方案。在記者會上，有記者會上，他回舉記者提問時指，如果中國大陸邀請，他十分樂意到中國舉行佈道會。記者又問他福音與中國的制度有無抵觸，他相信福音在世上任何制度下均能存在，沒有抵觸。被問到福音會否在中國復興時，他說：「我不是先知，不能預測將來之事，或者，現在中國大陸已有福音復興之現象，但，我不得而知」。有記者問他對「社會公義」的理解，葛回答：基督徒要在社會作鹽作光，但「改變社會制度永遠不會達到完全的地步，若要達到，要等到耶穌基督再來才能實現。我們不能在罪惡上建立完善的社會。」他重申，只有耶穌基督才能解答罪、痛苦及死亡的問題。\n\n\n為了籌備是次佈道會，香港華人基督教聯會成立了「香港葛培理佈道委員會」，自3月起每月舉行一次祈禱大會，4月舉行分區聖工人員聚會，緊著是動員會及詩班及陪談員的拓募及訓練。期間，「耶穌是道路、真理、生命」的宣傳廣告在大眾傳媒推出。據大會統計，五天合共赴會人數達22.33萬人，而決志者則合共2萬多人。\n\n\n(7) 第一屆世界華人福音會議First CCOWE, 1976（林來蔚1990）\n\n\n1976年8月，第一屆世界華人福音會議在香港舉行，主題為「異象與使命」，1600多位來自20多個國家的華人教會領袖出席會議。會議通過了兩個重要議案：（一）成立一個永久機構，推廣華福運動；（二）每五年舉行一次世幅華人福音會議。結果，「世界華人福音事工聯絡中心」（Chinese Coordination Centre of World Evangelization, CCOWE）在1976年10月在香港成立。\n\n\n華福會議的倡導者王永信牧師指出，會議的理念乃孕育自1974年的瑞士洛桑大會。當時出席會議的70位華人代表，經過共同商討後，決定在合適時間舉行一個世界華人福音會議。\n\n\n在華福中心推動下，致力探討有關華人教會增長的課題，並將美國福樂神學院差傳系的馬蓋文（Donald McGavran）的教會增長理論（church growth theory）引入，馬也是首屆華福會議的講員之一。此外，又推動華人教會的差傳事工，在1978年在菲律賓主辦第一屆華人差傳研討會，並出版《差傳基本認識》（1978）。同時，又出版《當代華人教會》刊物。\n\n\n1986年，出版《華人神學期刊》，吳明節在〈 發刊詞〉中指出，華人需要一份專門性的神學雜誌，希望可以肩負「中國神學的偉大使命」，「為中國的一班神學家提供發表靈感思想的園地」，「溝通中西神學的精神」，「為教會及廣大信徒建立神學思想而效力」。不過，《期刊》只出了八期，於1991年停刊。\n\n\n(8) 香港新生命福音遍傳運動I Found it, Here’s Life Hong Kong, 1977-78（高潔1977；高潔1978a；基督教週報1978）\n\n\n新生命福音遍傳運動源自美國，由學園傳道會於1977年2月倡導並介紹予香港眾教會，目的就是要讓香港450萬人口有機會聽到耶穌基督的福音，並給他們決志的機會。後來，由華人基督教聯會主持推動，並於3月成立籌備大會，聯會主席黃作任名譽主席，梁林開任大會主席。總幹事及副總幹事則由香港學園傳道會代表負責。執委會下設9個組別：青年組、婦女組、訓練組、財務組、大眾傳播組、公共關係組、聖工人員組、祈禱組及英語聯絡組。\n\n\n整個運動有四個特點：（1）以當地教會為主；（2）以訓練為主；（3）有明顯而短期的目標（16個月）；（4）有持續性：動員期後，受訓練信徒繼續領人歸主及造就初信。\n\n\n在1978年3月，以特別設計的口號及標貼、海報作全港宣傳，上刻有「我找到了！I Found It!」。3月24日，又舉行「廿四小時接力祈禱日」，於港九15處地方舉行祈禱會，時間由早上7時半至翌晨八時止，以兩小時為一單位，轉換教會，讓參加者同心為運動禱告。據統計，晚上八時至十二時合共200多人參加，而緊接凌晨至天亮時段，也有170多人出席。3月25日，於拔萃男書院舉行差遣禮，呼召及動員信徒去傳福音。3月26日起，千多名義工負責接聽電話，六天共接到56000多起來電，由於市民反應熱烈，故電話中心決定延長一週（總數達9100多來電）。在復活節下午有巡遊活動。最後階段，便是「個人談道運動週」，及各區以「在基督裡我找到新生命」為主題的佈道會。據大會表示，是次運動動員信徒多達萬人，義工也達5000多人。而全港在運動中決志人數多達2.8萬多人（其中個人談道決志1.8萬，電話談道決志1200多人，回信2200多人，各區佈道大會決志8500多人）\n\n\n(9)香港歸主運動Hong Kong for Christ, 1977-78（高潔1976；1978b）\n\n\n香港浸信會聯會於1977至78年間，發起名為「香港歸主運動」的佈道運動。是項運動乃響應美南浸信會國外傳道部發起的「大城市歸主」（Major City Evangelization ,  MCE ）運動，計劃自1976年至2000間，在世界主要城市開展佈道運動，將福音遍傳。香港是首個作出響應的城市，由浸聯會主席張有光任大會主席。\n\n\n香港歸主運動的口號是「新人新事」，取自《林後》五17。這項為期兩年的佈道運動，分四個階段進行：（1）各項籌備（1至12個月）；（2）廣傳福音：舉行各項不同佈道活動，包括小組、音樂會、培靈研經會、電影會、戲劇會、奮興會、家庭聚會、文字佈道等（第6至19個月）；（3）歸主運動：舉行聯合性大佈道會及各堂教會性佈道（第9至21個月）；（4）善後工作：裁培決志者，鼓勵加入教會（第19至24個月）。\n\n\n1978年11月2日起，一連五晚在界限街市政局球場舉行佈道大會，邀請美國侯斯頓第一浸信會主任牧師費約翰（John Bisagno）主領，另有參選香港小姐的美國留學生陳文玉見證。五晚合共1100多人決志。同時，在11月內，另外又於40多所浸信會及學校舉行佈道會，由多名中外牧者主領。\n\n\n1970年代，香港接連舉行大型佈道運動，成果斐然。就以1975年的葛培理佈道大會、1977至78年的「我找到了」福音遍傳運動及香港歸主運動為例，合共近4萬人（次）決志。不過，當時已開始有聲音反思：福音工作的「質量」需要兼顧（約翰1978）\n\n\n(10) 香港啟德機場聖堂啟用 1979（教聲1979）\n\n\n1979年1月27日，聖公會港澳教區白約翰會督及天主教香港教區主教為香港啟德機場聖堂舉行祝聖禮。聖堂名為 Chapel of Epiphany，是亞洲第一間機場聖堂，專為航空界人士及旅客提供安靜祈禱默想的地方。聖堂由民航處免費撥出地方，再由香港各教會團體合資裝修。\n\n\n(11) 越南難民與香港基督教（陳天權2021：108-111；梁家麟1999：308-309；基督教週報1979a, 1979b, 1979c, 1979d, 1979e；基督教週報1980；工商日報1979；醒華日報1979；SCMP 1979; Lane 1978； Chan 2017:）\n\n\n隨著越戰在1975年結束，越南勞動黨（後改名共產黨）執政後，引發大規範的難民潮。1978及79年，先後有兩艘戴有2000多名越南難民的貨輪進入香港水域。在1978年12月時，香港政府最初並不允許難民船靠岸，要延至1979年1月因船上物資短缺及衛生情況越趨惡劣，最終政府基於人道理由准許難民登岸，並安置在難民營內。事件受到國際關注。1979年，英國政府在日內瓦簽署關於越南難民問題的國際公約，其中包括香港將列為「第一收容港」，從越南出走的難民 1979年一年內，便有超過6.8萬名船民抵港，1980年更超過10萬。\n\n\n抵港船民，最初安置於當開放的啟德難民營，部分懂粵語的獲簽發難民證後，更可外出工作。但隨著船民人數增加，加上政府在1981年取消中國非法入境者的「抵壘政策」，為免被批評為雙重標準，乃於1982年將難民營改為禁閉營。1988年，實施甄別政策，船民須在香港接受難民資格甄別，如確認難民身份，便可安排到願意接收難民的西方國家，否則便被遣返原居地。1989年，推出自願遣返計劃，以及其後的「強制遣返」，不獲外國接收的船民被送回國。高鋒期全港有10多個難（船）民營和羈留中心也逐一關閉。\n\n\n早於1978年12月，政府拒絕「匯豐號」難民靠岸時，基督教協進會聯同聖公會白約翰會督及天主教胡振中主教向港府表達意見，請求以臨時方式收容船上難民，並呼籲教友願意作出賑濟施援。在政府以人道立場處接受難民後，白約翰又向普世教會協會及英、美、加、澳、紐各國基督教協進會發電，請其遊說政府增加接受難民的數額。白會督又派代表到普世教協，促請其協助滯留香港的難民。\n\n\n1979年初，基督教服務處率先提供援助，包括管理三個難民營（官塘、九龍城及深水埗），由聯合國難民委員會撥款，供應難民生活需求，又安排語言及工業技術訓練。協進會總幹事郭乃弘呼籲香港教會，應促進社會以友善及接納的心來面對越南難民，同時又通過國際教會的聯繫，讓各國政府重視越南難民問題。針對滯港難民，教會更可提供各種服務。\n\n\n1980年3月，基督教協進會「教會聯合發展委員會」及天主教香港教區在東啟德營內舉行一次題為「關懷與分享」的聚會，探討教會如何回應越南難民問題。當日聖公會白約翰會督及天主教胡振中主教在聯合崇拜及開幕禮中致詞，並有不同演競及討論後，交由協進會郭乃弘總結。\n\n\n除協進會及基督教服務處外，由施同福（ Karl Stumpf）牧師創辦的香港基督教難民服務處（Hong Kong Christian Aid to Refugees，1994年易名基督教勵行會）亦積極在啟德難民營內，提供牙醫服務，又開辦學校為兒童提供基本教育。在聯合國難民署資助下，1983年2月在收容中心辨「新秀學校」，為中小學適齡兒童提供全日制課程和職業訓練。1987年，香港紅十字會撤出難民收容中心後，原有工作也由香港基督教難民服務處接管。\n\n\n相對普世派背景基督教機構集中以救濟服務作回應，福音派則較關心難民的福音工作。香港華人基督教聯會在1979年7月成立「越南難民工作委員會」，聯會先墊支港幣10萬，作為難民援助之用。當時有教會到營內主持福音活動（福音晚會、主日學），又針對營內兒童提供服務。《基督教週報》又發起討論「本港教會應如何正視難民問題」。8月至9月，「越南難民工作委員會」聯繫10所教會，在馬頭圍營舉行10場福音晚會。\n\n\n建道神學院學生佈道團也在大嶼山芝麻灣監獄的船民羈留中心開展佈道工作，每周到中心作個人佈道，又有兒童事工。1983年，懲教署新規定只容許每次6名學生入營，於是每次進入中心只能進行成人佈道及跟進工作。\n\n\n不過，作為福音派的蘇恩佩（《突破》）卻指出，「難民」的出現是由於種族、宗教、國籍、社會背景或政治意見被迫害而流徙國外。「做『人』竟沒有『做人』的權利，落到有家歸不得的地步，無疑是「人類的大悲劇」。她呼籲基督徒要對「非人性」的世界加強警覺，表現基督徒的關懷來對付罪惡，提倡公義。「關懷，不是冷漠。越多的關懷越能夠解決問題」。\n\n\n1975至1998年間，估計香港合共接受了20萬越南難（船）民。最後，14.3萬難民獲其他國家收容，7.2萬遣返回越南，而1,400則獲准在香港居留。\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Attention to Churches in Post-Cultural Revolution China (1980)\n\n\nIn 1979, news about the reopening of churches in China after the Cultural Revolution reached Hong Kong. Various denominations expressed great concern about the developments in Chinese Christianity.\n\n\nIn November 1979, at the first executive committee meeting of the 1979–1980 session of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China, General Secretary Peter Wong pointed out that churches in China had become self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. These churches were no longer denominationally divided and had severed ties with foreign missionary organizations. They would not welcome the return of foreign missionaries. Additionally, the Bibles needed by the Chinese people would no longer require printing and transport from abroad. Foreign donations for rebuilding churches and meeting other needs had to be unconditional, motivated solely by love. Wong reiterated the council's stance of \"approaching the Guangzhou Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee as a self-sustaining Chinese church, seeking their input on establishing an unconditional fund to support church reconstruction, worship restoration, hymn printing, and the provision of teaching equipment for schools formerly affiliated with churches.\"\n\n\nIn May 1980, Anglican Bishop John Baker formed the \"China Church Concern Committee,\" with members including Canon Lam Yuek-Sum (convener), Canon Yip Sai-Shan, Reverend Ng Shing-Mou, Reverend Tang Hin-Sum, Dr. Sum Shuen-Yan, Mr. Chung Si-Leung, and Bishop Baker. During its first meeting, the committee unanimously agreed to encourage believers to interact more with Chinese Christians while respecting the principles of self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance. The committee identified theological and devotional books as the most pressing needs. In April 1980, Baker and Lam visited Guangzhou to meet local church leaders and conducted discussions at Dongshan Church. Writing in Hong Kong Church News, Lam introduced the Chinese Communist Party's religious policies and concluded, \"The survival and development of Christianity in China do not depend on whether the Communist Party aims to eliminate religion but on whether our faith represents true religion and whether there are people willing to dedicate themselves to spreading this true religion.\"\n\n\nThe January 1980 issue of The Message, published by the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC), reported on how Adventists, Lutherans, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church responded to the latest developments in Chinese churches. The Christian Weekly also covered discussions by Assemblies of God, World Mission, and World Lutheran organizations concerning ministry in China.\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Bible Society produced pocket-sized simplified Chinese New Testaments to encourage believers to take them into China when visiting family, thereby spreading the Gospel.\n\n\nFollowing this visit to Hong Kong, the China Christian Council invited the HKCC for a return visit scheduled for September 12–21, 1981, to Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, and Guangzhou. The delegation, led by Pastor Peter Wong and Bishop Peter Kwong, included representatives from various churches and organizations in Hong Kong.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Mission Consultation: The Role of Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s\n\n\nIn November 1980, the HKCC held a large conference to define the mission of Hong Kong churches for the 1980s. The consultation, titled The Mission of Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s, featured eight keynote speeches, including:  \n\n- \"Viewing Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s from an Eternal Perspective\" (Bishop John Baker)  \n\n- \"Hong Kong Churches in the 1980s\" (Peter Wong)  \n\n- \"Mission Strategies and Implementation Guidelines\" (Lee King-Hung and Fung Wai-Man)  \n\n- \"The Role of Evangelical Organizations and Volunteer Groups\" (Choi Yun-Wan and Ko Siu-Wah)  \n\n- \"The Mission of Congregations in the 1980s\" (Chan Cho-Choi and Lee Bing-Kwong).  \n\n\nIn addition to keynote speeches, there were three Bible study sessions led by Chung Chi Theological Division professors, focusing on Torah traditions, servant leadership, and Jesus’ mission in the Hong Kong context.\n\n\nThe conference attracted about 120 church representatives, including those from Catholic and evangelical circles. Five missional priorities were discussed and agreed upon:  \n\n1. Evangelizing low-income citizens.  \n\n2. Evangelizing students.  \n\n3. Supporting the Chinese church.  \n\n4. Participating in public policy-making.  \n\n5. Influencing the civic mindset.  \n\n\nThe Final Report of the Mission Consultation called for the HKCC to play a more active role in advocating church participation in public policy-making. Consequently, the HKCC established the \"Public Policy Committee\" in early 1981 to address and implement strategies for influencing public policies. The committee actively responded to societal issues, including significant policies like the Legislative Council's Powers and Privileges Bill, constitutional reforms, the Basic Law, and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant.\n\n\nAt the conference’s conclusion, news broke about a proposed 100% fare hike by local bus companies. A pastor urged the conference to express strong opposition, citing the lack of public consultation and the detrimental impact on low-income citizens. A motion opposing the hike passed overwhelmingly, and the HKCC General Secretary held a press conference the next day, sparking a \"massive civic movement.\" Over 300 groups later formed the \"Joint Committee Against Fare Hikes,\" which eventually expanded into the \"Joint Committee for the Monitoring of Public Utilities.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Campaign for the Construction of the Eastern District Hospital\n\n\nIn the 1970s, Chai Wan, an eastern district of Hong Kong Island, was nicknamed the \"wild district\" due to its remoteness. Its residents, mostly living in resettlement and squatter areas, faced poverty, with hillside shanties dominating the landscape. By the 1980s, the working class made up 60% of Chai Wan’s population. In 1982, four local church organizations conducted a survey revealing inadequate medical services as a major issue.\n\n\nAt the time, Chai Wan’s transportation relied solely on a congested Shau Kei Wan Road. The lack of hospitals meant residents had to travel to Wan Chai's Tang Shiu Kin Hospital or, in severe cases, Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam, exacerbating delays and fatalities during emergencies.\n\n\nSocial workers at Methodist Epworth Village Service Center discovered that as early as 1959, the government had planned a Shau Kei Wan hospital, but the project remained unrealized two decades later. Three pastors spearheaded a campaign for a new hospital: Rev. Chu Yiu-Ming of Chai Wan Baptist Church, Rev. Lo Lung-Kwong of Epworth Village Methodist Church, and Father Kwan Lui-Tong of the Catholic Star of the Sea Church. Chan Kin-Man, then a sociology student at Chung Chi College, joined the effort, researching emergency death rates in Eastern District and producing a report that became a cornerstone of the campaign.\n\n\nOn August 29, 1982, a public assembly established the \"United Committee for the Eastern District Hospital Campaign,\" joined by over 30 organizations and professional groups like the Hong Kong Medical Association. The government eventually conceded, opening an A&E department at Chai Wan Health Center in 1984 and allocating funds for the hospital.\n\n\nThe Eastern District Hospital broke ground in April 1984, with Rev. Chu representing the committee at the ceremony. Completed in 1993, the hospital’s name was changed from \"Shau Kei Wan Hospital\" to \"Eastern District Hospital\" in honor of the campaign. In 1992, it was renamed \"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital\" to commemorate Governor Sir Edward Youde’s contributions.\n\n(1)對文革後中國教會的關注 1980（教聲1980：1，林汝升1980：3；會訊1979：5；信息1980；基督教週報1980a, 1980b, 1980c，1980d）\n\n\n1979年，文革後中國教會復堂的消息傳到香港。各宗派對中國基督教的動向表達高度關注。\n\n\n1979年11月，中華基督教會香港區會在1979至80年度執行委員會第一次會議上，總幹事汪彼得指出，中國教會已成為中國人的自治自養自傳的教會，不再分宗派，並已割斷與外國差會的關係，今後也不會歡迎外國傳教士再回去工作。中國人民所需要的聖經，也無需由國外印備運入去。面對重建聖堂及其他需要，國外捐款必須沒有條件，出於愛心的捐獻。他重申，中華基督教會香港區會「以一個實行了三自的中國人教會，設法接觸廣州市三自愛國運動委員會，向他們徵詢意見，是否可由本會設立一筆中國教會復原專款，無條件的捐給該會作為修建教堂，恢復禮拜，印刷聖詩及幫助原屬教會的中學購置儀器沒書教學用具等」。\n\n\n1980年5月，聖公會港澳教區白約翰會督特別成為「中國教會關懷委員會」，成員包括林汝升法政牧師（召集人）、葉西山法政牧師、吳繩武牧師、湯顯森牧師、沈宣仁博士、鍾士良先生及白會督。委員會在第一次會議中，一致認為應鼓勵信眾多與中國信徒接觸，亦在尊重中國教會自養、自傳和自治的原則下，給予其所需之幫助。委員會認為，當前最大需要為神學及靈修書籍。白約翰與林汝升於1980年4月17至20日，更專程北上廣州拜訪當地教會領袖，亦在東山堂進行座談。林於《港澳教聲》撰文，介紹中共的宗教政策，最後指：「基督教在中國能否存在及發展，並不在於中共有無消滅宗教的政策，而在於我們的信仰是否真宗教，而在於有沒有為傳揚這真宗教而願意獻身的人」。\n\n\n1980年1月的協進會出版的《信息》，亦報導安息日會、路得會及信義會因應中國教會最新發展作出的跟進。《基督教週報》也報導神召會、世界傳道會及世界信義宗對中國事工的討論。\n\n\n香港聖經公會，特別出版袖珍本簡體字新約聖經，鼓勵信徒回鄉探親時，可以帶到中國，讓福音得以廣播。\n\n\n是次訪港後，中國基督教協會亦邀請香港基督教協進會回訪，行程定於1981年9月12至21日，訪問上海、南京、北京及廣州，由汪彼得牧師及鄺廣傑主教任領隊。其他成員包括：翁珏光（中華基督教會合一堂）、林汝升（聖公會聖馬利亞堂）、謝約翰（信義會監督）、李明道（安息日會）、劉少康（香港浸信教會）、羅文燦（路德會副會長）、高苕華（女青年會總幹事）、黃永熙（聖經公會總幹事）、蔡元雲（突破總幹事）、錢北斗（學生福音團契總幹事）、潘應求（崇基神學組主任）、黃道一（基督教文藝出版社社長）、林卓姿（基督徒學生運動代表）、郭乃弘（協進會總幹事）、馮煒文（協進會執行幹事、侯任詢世教會協會宣教幹事）、林澤（協進會執行幹事）。\n\n\n(2)「八十年代香港教會使命」諮詢會議1980  Mission Consultation, 1980（湯泳詩2019：100-108）\n\n\n1980年11月，協進會舉辦大型會議，為進入八十年代的香港教會尋索使命。是次題為「八十年代香港教會使命」的諮詢會議，八個專題演講包括：「從永恆角度看八十年代的香港教會」（白約翰會督）、「八十年代的香港教會」（汪彼得）、「宣教路線及執行方針」（李景雄、馮煒文）、「福音機構及教會志願團體的角色」（蔡元雲、高苕華）、「八十年代堂會的使命」（陳佐才、李炳光）。除專題外，又有三次研經會，由崇基神學組三位老師負責：李熾昌（妥拉傳統與香港）、戴智民（Richard Deutsch）（僕人使命與香港）、潘應求（耶穌使命與香港）。\n\n\n出席的教會代表約120人，包括天主教及福音派亦有派代表出席。會議就五項宣教議程作討論，並達成共識：「向低薪市民傳福音」「向學生傳福音」「關懷中國教會」「參與公共政策釐定」「影響市民心態」。\n\n\n〈八十年代香港教會使命諮詢會議總報告〉指出，協進會在推動教會參與釐訂公共政策方面，應扮演較活躍的角色。職是之故，協進會於1981年初即成立了「公共政策委員會」，跟進及落實如何「參與公共政策釐定」。公共政策委員會成立後，積極回應香港社會的問題，並就一些影響民生重大的政策提出意見。這包括：立法局之權力和特權法案、政制改革及基本法、《顧問醫療報告書》、大亞灣核電廠等等。其中在香港政制改革及基本法草擬方面，委員會更舉辦了多次活動。\n\n\n在會議結束前，傳來了巴士公司向政府提出加價百分之百的建議，會上有牧師提出要求大會表達強烈反對，理由是在這影響民生的大事上，市民未被諮詢，而且加價必然嚴重影響低薪市民的生活，會議最後以極大多數通過上述動議。隨即由協進會總幹事於翌日召開記者招待會，肇始了一個「龐大的市民運動」。後來，有超過三百個團體聯合組成「反對兩巴加價聯合委員會」，日後又擴大成為「各界監管公共事業聯合委員會」。據當時任協進會總幹事的郭乃弘牧師表示，這次聯合行動的最大意義，不僅是成功逼使兩巴減低加價的幅度，更在於其開啟了以「聯席」（coalition）的方式進行社會運動的洗河。八十年代初至中期，基督教團體發起名參與的聯席委員會包括：「各界爭取監管兩電聯委會」（1981）、「各界爭取監管公共事業聯委會」（1982）、「關注民生聯委會」、「爭取興建東區醫院聯合委員會」（1982）、「各界關注同性戀法例聯委會」（1983）、「監察色情刊物監察團體聯席會議」（1985）、「爭取停建大亞灣核電廠聯席會議」（1986）等等\n\n\n(3) 爭取興建東區醫院運動（朱耀明2023：139-152）\n\n\n70年代，位於香港島東區的柴灣被區內人稱為「紅番區」，由於地區偏僻，市民大多聚居於徙置區和臨屋區，生活貧窮，山邊遍滿自建的木屋。80年代，工人階級佔柴灣人口六成。1982年，柴灣區內四所教會機構（柴灣浸信會、柴灣萬善堂、循道愛華村服務中心、天主教柴灣勞工牧民中心）合作進行「柴灣工友生活實況」調查，發現區內醫療服務不足的問題，值得關注。\n\n\n當時柴灣對外交通極不方便，只靠一條筲箕灣道，才可到達港島其他地區，但居民每日卻面對的塞車問題的困擾。當時港島東並沒有醫院，居民需往急症室就醫，最近的急症室都要到灣仔的鄧肇堅醫院。若病情或傷勢較重者，則要再等待救護車送往港島西區薄扶林的瑪麗醫院，路途遙遠，再加上塞車問題，因而常有在途中失救死亡的情況。\n\n\n當時循道愛華村服務中心社工發現，早於1959年政府已計劃興建筲箕灣醫院，但隨著區內人口增加，結果20年過後，計劃仍未見落實。有見及此，柴灣區內三位牧者乃發動居民爭取興建東區醫院運動，包括柴灣浸信會朱耀明牧師、循道衛理愛華村堂的盧龍光牧師及天主教海星堂關𠎀棠神父。當時在中文大學崇基學院社會系三年級基督徒學生陳健民，和兩位同合作以東區醫療問題報告為題目，作為通識專題研究的研究。他們不惜親身到港島東區多個救護站，懇求救護員容許他抄寫病人或傷者送院期間不治的數字，作為東區失救延醫的理據。陳健民大學畢業後，即加入循道愛華村堂社會服務中心，繼續參與爭取興建東區醫院運動，並負責資料搜集、調查和撰寫《港島東區醫療問題報告書》。\n\n\n1982年8月29日，召開聯合居民大會，成立「爭取興建東區醫院聯合委員會」，朱、關及盧三位牧者出席。對此，政府的回應並不積極。聯委會在港島東設多處街站，一周內收集到3.5萬名居民的簽名，會見東區政務專員。運動展開，東區有三十多個團體參加，此外並獲得香港醫學會、東華三院醫生協會、醫療關注組等專業組織之支持。後來，政府應度軟化，在1984年4月同意灰柴灣健康院開設急症室，並公布撥款興建東區醫院。\n\n\n1984年4月，東區醫院舉行動土禮，朱耀明牧師以聯委會成員身分獲邀出席。1993年，東區醫院竣工。東區醫院原稱為「筲箕灣醫院」，後因爭取興建運動而改名為「東區醫院」。後來，為記念1986年離世的港督尤德爵士為香港前途奔勞，於1992年將東區醫院命名為「尤德夫人」醫院。\n\n\n (4) Visit of the Chinese Christian Delegation to Hong Kong (1981)  \n\n\nIn March 1981, at the invitation of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA) and the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC), a Chinese Christian delegation visited Hong Kong for three weeks. This marked the first contact between Hong Kong and Chinese churches since the near 30-year hiatus that followed the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.  \n\n\nThe delegation consisted of eight members:  \n\n- Bishop Ding Guangxun: Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, President of the China Christian Council, and President of Nanjing Union Theological Seminary.  \n\n- Shen Derong: General Secretary of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee.  \n\n- Luo Guanzong: Vice Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, Chairman of the Shanghai Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and General Secretary of the Shanghai YMCA.  \n\n- Tang Matthew: Vice President of the China Christian Council, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and Pastor of Guangzhou Dongshan Church.  \n\n- Cao Shengjie: Deputy General Secretary of the China Christian Council.  \n\n- Han Wenzao: Deputy General Secretary of both the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and the China Christian Council.  \n\n- Cai Wenhao: Vice President of the China Christian Council, Chairman of the Zhejiang Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and Pastor of Hangzhou Bell Tower Church.  \n\n- Xiong Zhenpei: Vice Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and Chairman of the Guangdong Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee.  \n\n\nThe inclusion of two representatives from Guangdong Province highlighted the close ties between the churches in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The delegation members represented various denominational backgrounds, including Anglican, Baptist, the Church of Christ in China, and Methodist traditions, reflecting historical links to Hong Kong’s prominent denominations.  \n\n\nOn April 8, the delegation issued a Letter to Christian Brothers and Sisters in Hong Kong, emphasizing that churches in China had achieved self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation under the new China. They had eliminated internal denominational biases and mutually respected differences in faith. They stated that the Gospel had flourished during the Cultural Revolution and reiterated that under the principles of the Three-Self Movement, Chinese churches sought open exchange with overseas churches on an equal and friendly basis. They called on foreign believers to respect the autonomy and principles of the Chinese church and to avoid actions that might compromise its witness.  \n\n\nDuring their visit, the delegation attended the Asian Christian Witness Consultation and delivered three lectures:  \n\n- \"Chinese Christianity: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow\" (Cai Wenhao).  \n\n- \"The Testimony of the Chinese Church for the Gospel\" (Cao Shengjie).  \n\n- \"The Experience of Chinese Christians Participating in National Political Life\" (Han Wenzao).  \n\n\nThe delegation also held a discussion with HKCC leaders and participated in a joint thanksgiving service where Pastor Tang Matthew preached on \"The Context and Impact of the Jerusalem Council.\" The service was attended by leaders from various denominations and institutions in Hong Kong.  \n\n\nIn July 1981, the HKCC published a compilation of the delegation's visit titled The Lord’s Love Endures to the End.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Seminar on Christian Education in Hong Kong (1984)  \n\n\nIn April 1984, in response to changes triggered by Hong Kong’s future sovereignty issues and the report of the International Education Advisory Board, the HKCC co-hosted a seminar with Tao Fong Shan Christian Centre to reflect on the direction of Christian education. The seminar, titled \"Seeking: The Theological Foundation of Education in Hong Kong,\" featured Reverend Lee Ching-Tsz, who criticized churches for becoming mere contractors for the government’s educational policies. The HKCC’s theological reflections also acknowledged that churches had overly complied with governmental directives.  \n\n\nThe seminar's content was later compiled and published by the HKCC under the title Theological Reflections on Education in Hong Kong.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) The Credo and Declaration on Religious Freedom (1984)  \n\n\nStarting in the 1980s, concerns over the \"1997\" sovereignty issue became a central focus for Hong Kong residents. In March 1984, over twenty church leaders and professionals convened to discuss how Christians should face the challenges of 1997, forming the Concern Group on Hong Kong’s Future. After extensive discussions, the group drafted a position paper titled Proposals on the Beliefs Held by Hong Kong Christians Amidst Current Social and Political Changes on April 30, 1984. This document marked a significant reflection and response by Hong Kong Christians to the sovereignty issue.  \n\n\nOn May 20, a revival meeting themed \"Social Change and Believer Renewal\" was held at Kowloon City Baptist Church, where the Credo and its annotations were distributed. The event drew nearly 3,000 participants, reflecting the church’s deep concern for Hong Kong’s future.  \n\n\nTo promote the Credo, a supplementary booklet titled Examining the Credo in Context was published, with a foreword by Reverend Stephen Tong, who acknowledged the profound reflections on the intersection of faith and context prompted by the impending changes in 1997. Tong praised the Credo as the collective wisdom of 27 church workers and evangelists, representing the views of most church leaders and believers in Hong Kong. The booklet provided a theological and contextual analysis grounded in Scripture, further strengthening its biblical foundation.  \n\n\nIn May 1984, the HKCC commissioned a working group, including Chan Cho-Choi, Yu Tat-Sum, and Hui Dao-Leung, to draft a Declaration on Religious Freedom. Yu noted that the declaration aimed to foster inter-denominational collaboration and mitigate \"distrust and suspicion.\" To this end, a pastoral seminar was held on June 4 to explain the declaration, with responses from pastors such as Stephen Tong, Siu Kwok-Wai, and Chiu Tin-Yan.  \n\n\nThe declaration, eventually endorsed by 240 church organizations, was officially released on September 1, 1984, and submitted to Premier Zhao Ziyang via Xinhua News Agency. It reaffirmed the importance of religious freedom, outlined the state of religious liberties at the time, and expressed hopes for their continuation after 1997.\n\n(4) 中國基督教代表團訪問香港 1981（馮煒文、林澤 1981）\n\n\n1981年3月，應亞洲基督教議會（Christian Conference of Asia）及香港基督教協進會邀請，中國基督教代表團來香港進行為期三星期的訪問。這是1949年中共建國後，中港教會中斷近三十年交往後，重新恢復首次接觸。\n\n\n中國基督教代表團有8名成員：丁光訓主教（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席、中國基督教協會會長、南京協和神學院院長）、沈德溶（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會秘書長）、羅冠宗（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會副主席、上海市基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席、上海基督教青年會總幹事）、唐馬太（中國基督教協會副會長、廣東基督教三自愛國運動委員會副主席、廣州東山堂牧師）、曹聖潔（中國基督教協會副總幹事）、韓文藻（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會副秘書長、中國基督教協會副總幹事）、蔡文浩（中國基督教協會副會長、浙江省基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席、杭州鼓樓堂牧師）、熊真沛（中國基督教三自愛國運動委員會副主席、廣東省基督教三自愛國運動委員會主席）。8名代表中，除了全國基督教愛國團體的主要負責人外，特別安排2位來自廣東省的代表，應是考慮到粵港兩地教會的緊密關係。另方面，代表團成員，也具聖公會、浸信會、中華基督教會、循道公會等「原宗派」背景，均是香港歷史悠久的宗派。\n\n\n代表團在4月8日向香港教會發布〈致香港基督教弟兄姊妹書〉，強調中國教會在新中國已實現自治、自養及自傳，並消除教會內部的宗派成見，在信仰上互相尊重。文革期間，福音沒有熄滅，反而更加興旺。在三自原則下，中國教會不是閉關自守，願意在平等友好基礎上與海外各國教會交流。期望海外信徒尊重中國教會主權和「三自」原則，不做任何有損中國教會見證的事。\n\n\n訪港期間，代表團出席「亞洲基督徒見證諮詢會」，並發表三個演講「中國基督教：昨日、今日、明日」（蔡文浩）、「中國基督教為福音所作的見證」（曹聖潔）、「中國基督徒參加國家政治生活的體驗與領受」（韓文藻）。\n\n\n會議後，代表團與協進會負責人舉行座談會、聯合感恩崇拜，由唐馬太宣講「耶路撤冷會議的前後」，崇拜出席者包括香港各宗派及機構負責人。\n\n\n1981年7月，協進會將訪問團訪港內容結集出版，書名為《主愛我們到底》。\n\n\n(5) 香港教會辦學路向研討會1984（馮穎賢1984）\n\n\n香港基督教協進會因應香港前途問題及國際教育顧問團報告書所引發的轉變，於1984年4月與道風山基督教叢林合辦研討會，反省基督教辦學的路向。研討會的主題為「覓：香港教育的神學基礎」，會上，李清詞牧師不滿教會辦學已變成政府的教育承辦商，完全受政府的教育方針所牽制。協進會就香港教育所作的神學反省中，也承認教會成了政府的承辦商，對政府的教育政策唯命是從。研討會的內容，後來由協進會結集出版，題為《香港教育的神學反省》。\n\n\n(6)信念書及宗教自由聲明1984（郭偉聯2014：84-124；邢福增2018：178-185）\n\n\n1980年代開始，「九七」香港前途問題成為港人關注的焦點。早於1984年3月，廿多位關注香港前途問題的教會領袖及專業人士聚首一堂，探討基督徒應如何面對九七挑戰，成立了「關注香港前途小組」。經過多次討論後，小組於1984年4月30日，草擬了一份名為《香港基督徒在現今社會及政治變遷中所持的信念獻議》的立場書，標誌著香港基督徒對九七問題的回應與反省。5月20日，以「社會變遷與信徒更新」為主題的培靈會於九龍城浸信會舉行，並派發《信念書註釋》，當日出席聚會者近三千人，在在反映出教會對香港社會前途的關注。\n\n\n為了推廣〈信念書〉又出版《時代信念查考》。滕近輝牧師撰寫序文，承認「當香港基督徒面臨一九九七變動之際，引起處境與信仰相互關係的深切反省。」因此，他特別稱許〈信念書〉是「廿七位教牧人員及福音機構同工的思想結晶」，「也普遍的代表著香港一般教會領袖與信徒的觀點」。而《時代信念查考》一書，「根據聖經，作了適切的神學與處境上的分析和闡述，強化了它的聖經根據」。\n\n\n1984年5月，基督教協進會委任包括陳佐才、余達心、許道良等五人的工作小組，負責草擬宗教自由聲明。余氏指出，為了推動教會間不同宗派間的合作，避免「猜疑與信任」，特別在6月4日召開一次教牧研討會解釋這份聲明。會上，滕牧師、蕭克諧、趙天恩對聲明作出回應。聲明最後獲得240個教會機構及堂會聯署。9月1日，聲明正式公佈並經香港新華社轉交國務院總理趙紫陽。聲明重申宗教自由的重要性，以及當時教會享用有的宗教自由情況，最後表達對九七年後繼續享有宗教自由的期許。\n\n (7) Visit of the Hong Kong Christian Delegation to Beijing (1984)  \n\n\nDuring the Sino-British negotiations, various sectors in Hong Kong, including professionals, business leaders, social activists, educators, university students, and notable public figures, organized delegations to Beijing to express concerns about Hong Kong's future. However, the Christian delegation's visit to Beijing occurred at the proactive invitation of the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau.\n\n\nIn May 1984, the HKCC appointed a five-member working group, including Chan Cho-Choi, Yu Tat-Sum, and Hui Dao-Leung, to draft a Declaration on Religious Freedom. The declaration was officially released on September 1, 1984, and submitted to Premier Zhao Ziyang via Xinhua News Agency. Although the declaration was only formally published on September 1, the central government and Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong had already been made aware of the church’s concerns about post-1997 religious freedom. Consequently, the central government extended an invitation to Hong Kong’s Christian community to visit Beijing.\n\n\nSince the delegation was invited by the central government, the list of members was nominated by Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong and approved by the central government. The delegation was co-led by four prominent figures:  \n\n- Bishop Peter Kwong (Anglican Bishop of Hong Kong and Macau, the first Chinese bishop).  \n\n- Rev. Stephen Tong (President of the China Graduate School of Theology and Chair of the Christian and Missionary Alliance).  \n\n- Rev. Leung Lam-Hoi (President of the Methodist Church, Hong Kong, and former Chair of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union).  \n\n- Rev. Kwok Nai-Hung (General Secretary of the HKCC).  \n\n\nThis arrangement carried significant symbolism. Bishop Kwong represented the Anglican Church, historically prominent during the colonial era. The HKCC, although younger and lacking evangelical representation compared to the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union, had been more active in social affairs and engagement with the Chinese government. Including Rev. Stephen Tong, a key evangelical leader, balanced the delegation’s composition, which also included representatives from ecumenical and evangelical backgrounds.  \n\n\nThe delegation departed for Beijing on the morning of September 5, 1984. Notably, Rev. Stephen Tong did not appear at Kai Tak Airport on the day of departure. The HKCC later explained in its publication The Message that Tong could not join the trip due to \"health reasons,\" though subsequent accounts suggested he faced significant pressure and criticism, particularly from evangelical circles in North America.  \n\n\nDuring the visit, the delegation met with officials, including Ren Wuzhi, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau, and Ji Pengfei, Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. They presented a document titled Opinions of the Hong Kong Christian Delegation on Hong Kong’s Future, accompanied by the Declaration on Religious Freedom.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (8) Visit of the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau Director to Hong Kong (1986)  \n\n\nFrom April 1 to April 10, 1986, Ren Wuzhi, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau under China’s State Council, visited Hong Kong. This marked the first official visit by a director from the Religious Affairs Bureau. The visit centered on discussions with Hong Kong’s religious community about post-1997 relations and related policy issues.\n\n\nOn April 1, the leaders of Hong Kong’s six major religions hosted a welcoming banquet. A Buddhist representative, Venerable Sik Kok-Kwong, highlighted the contributions of the religious community to Hong Kong’s social welfare, stability, and prosperity. He emphasized the need for the Basic Law to explicitly guarantee religious freedom and to preserve Hong Kong’s existing religious systems and development. Ren Wuzhi acknowledged the growing mutual understanding and respect between the religious communities in China and Hong Kong, describing such exchanges as beneficial.\n\n\nDuring his visit, Ren engaged with various Christian organizations, including the HKCC, United Christian Hospital, the Breakthrough organization, and Methodist schools. At a meeting with Christian leaders at Kowloon Methodist Church, Ren stated that after 1997, churches in Hong Kong could continue their missionary work, develop freely, and maintain links with foreign religious groups. When asked whether foreign pastors could continue serving in Hong Kong post-1997, Ren replied that such decisions would be left to the churches. He also addressed questions about preaching to young people, confirming that the Chinese constitution did not prohibit it and that Hong Kong churches could continue their current practices.  \n\n\nOn April 3, Ren visited the Islamic Union of Hong Kong, where representatives expressed confidence in religious freedom after 1997. On April 4, he toured Catholic charitable facilities, where Cardinal John Baptist Wu introduced the Catholic Church’s contributions to evangelism, education, and social services in Hong Kong. Ren reiterated that China’s policy of religious freedom would remain unchanged.  \n\n\nRen also visited Buddhist, Confucian, and Taoist institutions, including the Buddhist Hospital, the Confucian Academy, and the Wong Tai Sin Temple, commending their contributions to Hong Kong society. On April 9, Ren met again with leaders of the six major religions, reaffirming that Hong Kong would retain religious freedom under the principles of \"non-interference, non-subordination, and mutual respect,\" as outlined in Annex I of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He praised the religious community’s efforts in education, healthcare, and social welfare, emphasizing their role in Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity.  \n\n\nRen concluded that under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, Hong Kong’s religious landscape would remain unchanged post-1997, and religious organizations would not fall under the jurisdiction of China’s Religious Affairs Bureau or any other association.  \n\n(7)香港基督教訪京團1984（邢福增2018：178-185）\n\n\n中英談判期間，香港各界人士紛紛組團北上，向中國領導人表達對香港前途的關注。這包括專業人士、工商界、社會活動家、教育界、專上學生、知名人士等等。不過，基督教人士訪京之行，卻是在國務院宗教事務局主動邀請下成行的。\n\n\n先是1984年5月，基督教協進會委任包括陳佐才、余達心、許道良等五人的工作小組，負責草擬宗教自由聲明。9月1日，聲明正式公佈並經香港新華社轉交國務院總理趙紫陽。雖然聲明在9月1日才公佈，但教會界對九七後宗教自由的關注，定為香港新華社及中央知悉。因此，中央主動邀請基督教界訪京。\n\n\n由於訪京團由中央邀請，故團員名單也是經香港新華社提名，再由中央確認，其中共同領隊的四人是：鄺廣傑主教（聖公會港澳教區主教）、滕近輝牧師（中國神學研究院院長、宣道會區聯會主席）、梁林開牧師（循道衛理聯合教會會長）及郭乃弘牧師（香港基督教協進會總幹事）。上述安排無疑具有深意：其一，傳統以來，聖公會在殖民地時代均有較獨特的地位，而鄺廣傑是首位華人主教。其二，香港較具代表性的基督教團體，是香港基督教協進會及香港華人基督教聯會，雖然前者的歷史較後者為短，也沒有包括福音派的成員，但協進會向來較積極參與社會事務，比聯會更積極與中國政府接觸。其三，正因為協進會不能代表福音派，故滕近輝這位具份量的福音派領袖便榜上有名。其四，梁林開是循道衛理聯合教會會長，但他曾任多屆聯會主席（1978-1980，1982-1983）。\n\n\n至於其他團員，名單及分類如下：\n\n\n| 宗派領袖denominational leaders | 謝約翰牧師（香港基督教信義會監督）、李偉韜牧師（香港路德會會長）、王溢中牧師（基督教復臨安息日會港澳區會會長）、蕭開理牧師（東南亞神召會港澳議會會長）Rev. John Tse (Supervisor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hong Kong),  Rev. Wei-To Lee (President of the Hong Kong Lutheran Church),  Rev.

Responding to the escalating situation of the Beijing student movement, the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau held a prayer meeting for the future of China and the well-being of the Chinese nation at St. John’s Cathedral on May 11. The Diocese called on the Chinese government to \"absolutely refrain from using force to address the student movement,\" \"seek a peaceful resolution promptly,\" and \"immediately restore freedom of the press.\" Around 600 pastors and congregants attended. Bishop Peter Kwong emphasized that the students' \"righteous call is an act of patriotism,\" and he prayed for \"the Lord to grant Chinese leaders wisdom, patience, and restraint.\"\n\n\nFollowing Beijing's declaration of martial law, Bishop Kwong urged the government not to use force against the student movement. On May 21, he resigned from his positions as a member of the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the Consultative Committee. According to the church newsletter Echo, Bishop Kwong explained that his resignation was due to observing the suppression of news coverage beginning on May 20, leaving him unable to track developments. He hoped his resignation would signal the impact of the government's actions. Kwong also noted that his role in the drafting process was nearing completion and that he had already strived to secure religious freedom and direct elections.\n\n\nOn May 28, the Diocese organized \"Prayer and Fasting Meetings for China\" at four churches across Hong Kong, Kowloon, the New Territories, and Macau. After the June Fourth Massacre, the Diocese issued a statement expressing \"deep mourning\" and \"grief and indignation\" over the Beijing authorities' violent suppression and mass killings of students and citizens. A memorial service was held at St. John’s Cathedral on June 11, and on June 7, church bells tolled for one minute at noon in memory of the victims.\n\n\nOn October 31, 1989, the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress reviewed changes to the membership of the Basic Law Drafting Committee during its tenth meeting. The committee approved the resignations of Louis Cha (Jin Yong) and Bishop Peter Kwong while expressing hope for their continued contributions to the drafting process.\n\n\nBetween the declaration of martial law on May 19 and the June 4 massacre, various sectors of Hong Kong society voiced their concerns. Many churches, Christian organizations, and believers issued urgent appeals and statements of mourning. The Hong Kong Christian Patriotic Democratic Movement Committee was also established on May 2, playing a vital role in mobilizing Christian concern for national affairs. Rev. Chu Yiu-Ming represented the movement by joining the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, serving as its vice-chairman.\n\n\nMotivated by support for the 1989 student movement and outrage over the Chinese Communist Party's violent suppression, many Hong Kong Christians, denominations, congregations, and organizations issued rare prayers and statements of concern, including those from Evangelical backgrounds. While debates persisted within individual churches over whether Christians and churches should participate in protests or issue statements, the overall response of Hong Kong's churches during the events surrounding June Fourth marked a significant chapter in the intersection of church and political issues.\n\n(10) 香港基督教與六四\n\n\n1989年的六四慘案激發香港人的移民潮，香港教會承受重大衝擊。因應北京學運局勢，聖公會港澳教區特別在5月11日在聖約翰座堂舉行為中國前途及中華民族整體幸福祈禱會，並呼籲中國政府「絕對不可使用武力處理學運事件」，「從速尋求和平解決之途徑」及「立即恢復新聞自由」。當日出席的牧師及教友約600多人，鄺廣傑主教致詞時認為中國學生「發出正義的呼聲是愛國愛民的行動」，祈求「上主賜中國領導人有智慧、忍耐及克制」。聖公會港澳教區主教鄺廣傑因應北京頒佈戒嚴令，呼籲北京「切勿武力處理學運」，並於5月21日起呈辭基本法草委及諮委職務。鄺請辭的原因，據《教聲》報導：「鄺主教稱其因觀察整件學運事件之過程及演變，直至五月廿日開始出現新聞封鎖的情況，導致他無從知悉事態進展，因此他呈辭行動，讓有關方面知道他們的措施，所引來的反應。鄺主教又稱，他在基本法的起草工作已接近尾聲，又已盡力爭取宗教自由及直選，所以留任作用不會太大。」\n\n\n港澳教區在5月28日在港九新界及澳門四所教會舉行「主愛中華禁食祈禱會」。六四屠殺發生後，教區發出「沉痛哀悼」聲明，對「北京當局以暴力鎮壓學生運動，濫殺同胞」，表示悲憤，並於6月11日假聖約翰座堂舉行追思禮拜。教區各禮拜堂更於6月7日中午12時為哀悼死難學生及市民鳴鐘一分鐘。\n\n\n1989年10月31日，七屆全國人大常委會十次會議審議基本法起草委員會部分委員變動的報告，決定「同意查良鏞、鄺廣傑辭去起草委員會委員職務。希望他們對基本法起草工作繼續作出貢獻」。\n\n\n從1989年5月19日北京頒佈戒嚴，至6月4日的屠殺清場，香港社會各界紛紛表達關注，不少基督教會、團體及信徒，紛紛刊登緊急哀悼及聲明。此外，香港基督徒支援愛國民主運動委員會也於5月2日成立，在推動基督徒關心國是方面，扮演重要角色。朱耀明牧師代表基督徒愛國民主運動參加「香港市民支援愛國民主運動聯合會」（支聯會），被選為副主席。\n\n\n出於對八九學運的支持，以及對中共暴力鎮壓的義憤，不少香港基督徒、宗派、堂會及機構均罕有地發表禱文及關注聲明，其中更包括不少福音派背景的宗派堂會。毋庸置疑，個別教會內仍有關於基督徒及教會應否參與遊行及發聲明的討論，但香港教會在六四前後的整體表現，也在教會與政治議題上寫下重要的篇章。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Hong Kong Church Mission Consultation for the 1990s, 1990 (Hong Kong Christian Council, 1990; Tong Wing-see, 2019: 85-89)\n\n\nFrom April 17–23, 1990, the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC) held the \"Hong Kong Church Mission Consultation for the 1990s,\" addressing the decade's challenges with the motto: \"Upholding an enduring mission, remaining faithful to God's calling, responding to contemporary challenges, and turning crises into opportunities.\"\n\n\nTopics covered in the consultation included:\n\n- \"Unity to Respond to the Times: Starting with the Unity Christ Prayed For\" (Siu Hok-hai)\n\n- \"Exalting Christ and Proclaiming the Mission of the Gospel\" (Lau Siu-hong)\n\n- \"The Mission of Local Churches in the 1990s\" (Lee Ping-kwong)\n\n- \"The Social Mission of Hong Kong Churches in the 1990s\" (Ng Shui-lai)\n\n- \"Bearing the Cross and Shepherding the Nations\" (Choi Yuen-wan)\n\n\nTwo Bible study sessions were also held:\n\n- \"The Mission of the Hong Kong Church in the 1990s Through Jeremiah’s Temple Sermon\" (Chow Wing-kin)\n\n- \"Acts of the Apostles and the Mission of the Hong Kong Church in the 1990s\" (Chow Tin-wah)\n\n\nParticipants were divided into ten groups to discuss:\n\n1. Church unity amid social upheaval\n\n2. Collaboration with churches worldwide and in China\n\n3. Evangelizing Hong Kong residents during the transition period\n\n4. The roles of evangelical organizations and faith communities during transitions\n\n5. Strengthening theological education to meet contemporary challenges\n\n6. Pastoral work in transitioning churches\n\n7. Church social services during transitions\n\n8. Educational ministries during transitions\n\n9. Encouraging Christians to support democratic governance\n\n10. Promoting \"universal priesthood\" among believers\n\n\nThe conference concluded with the \"Mission Statement for the Hong Kong Church in the 1990s,\" which acknowledged the decade as a period of identity transformation, filled with both crises and hope. It emphasized the church’s responsibility to remain faithful to God’s calling, respond to contemporary challenges, and turn crises into opportunities. The statement urged the church to stand in solidarity with Hong Kong citizens, sharing in their struggles and committing to the city’s long-term future. Politically, the church pledged to advocate for justice, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law while urging the Chinese and British governments to honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration and ensure the Basic Law promotes a just and equitable society.\n\n\nA follow-up consultation, the \"Mid-Term Mission Consultation for the 1990s,\" was held in November 1994, resulting in the publication of a pastoral letter to all Hong Kong Christians.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) We Love Hong Kong Campaign, 1991 (Hong Kong Christian Council, 1991: 5-6)\n\n\nIn November 1988, the HKCC’s Social Concerns Committee resolved to launch the \"We Love Hong Kong\" campaign to enhance Hong Kong residents' sense of identity and belonging. While the decision was initially postponed, the campaign was revived after the 1989 Tiananmen Square Incident and a subsequent surge in emigration. The committee drafted a proposal for the campaign, which was endorsed by the HKCC Executive Committee. The initiative brought together representatives from churches and non-church social service organizations to form the \"We Love Hong Kong Campaign Committee.\"\n\n\nThe campaign’s objectives included:\n\n1. Affirming Hong Kong residents' love for their city and redirecting attention from emigrants to those who stayed, encouraging pride in Hong Kong’s achievements and fostering a greater sense of responsibility for its future.\n\n2. Highlighting Hong Kong citizens' identity as key contributors to the city’s modernization and resilience in overcoming challenges.\n\n3. Providing a platform for emotional expressions of love and hope for Hong Kong through various actions.\n\n4. Showcasing organizations' solidarity with Hong Kong’s future and their contributions to society during the 1990s.\n\n\nActivities included essay and drawing competitions, slogan contests, a \"We Love Democratic Hong Kong\" mock voting project, the publication of a book exploring ways to express love for Hong Kong, academic seminars, photography contests, a \"We Love Hong Kong Sacred Music Worship Service\" (held on October 12 at the Hong Kong Coliseum), and designating June 30 as \"Love Hong Kong Sunday,\" with July 1 observed as \"Hong Kong Sunday\" annually.\n\n\nParticipating organizations included the Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs Association of Hong Kong, Caritas, the YMCA, and numerous Christian and Catholic groups, among others.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Hong Kong Christian Delegation to Beijing, 1991 (Christian Times, 1991a)\n\n\nFrom November 16–23, 1991, the HKCC organized a delegation to Beijing at the invitation of the State Administration for Religious Affairs. This was the first official church visit to Beijing since 1984 and marked the Chinese government’s first invitation to Hong Kong churches after the Tiananmen Square Incident, symbolizing an effort to rebuild relations.\n\n\nThe delegation was led by Pastor Lee Ping-kwong (HKCC Chairperson) and included Vice-Chairperson Ko Siu-wah, General Secretary Rev. Cho Man-king, and other representatives from various denominations, seminaries, and Christian organizations. Notable members included Archbishop Kwong Kong-kit (Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau), Rev. Ng Shui-lai (Chairperson of the Hong Kong Lutheran Church), and Rev. Choi Yuen-wan (Baptist Convention of Hong Kong).\n\n\nThe delegation presented a statement titled Observations of the Hong Kong Christian Delegation to Beijing, which addressed two main topics:\n\n1. Views on Hong Kong society: Acknowledging heightened public interest in human rights, rule of law, and democratic development since 1989, the statement celebrated the introduction of direct elections to the Legislative Council in 1991 as a significant step toward Hong Kong’s post-1997 goal of \"high degree of autonomy and Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong.\"\n\n2. Views on the Hong Kong church: Reaffirming the church’s commitment to social services, education, and local church development, the statement emphasized the church’s role in bringing confidence and hope to Hong Kong people during this transitional period. Despite social upheaval, the church pledged to cherish its freedoms and continue serving the city.\n\n\nDuring the visit, the delegation met with Ren Wuzhi (Director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs), Chen Ziying (Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office), and Ding Guangxun (President of the China Christian Council). Discussions included human rights, with Ren emphasizing China’s differing views from the West as outlined in the White Paper on Human Rights in China. Ren also reaffirmed Hong Kong’s religious freedom after 1997, based on principles of mutual independence, non-interference, and mutual respect.\n\n(1)九十年代香港教會使命諮詢會議 1990（香港基督教協進會 1990；湯泳詩2019：85-89）\n\n\n基督教協進會在1990年4月17至23日召開的「九十年代香港教會使命諮詢會議」，提出以「貫徹歷久不變的使命，忠於上帝所託、回應時代挑戰，使危機化為轉機」的精神，迎向90年代這個決定性的時代。\n\n\n會議專題包括：「團結合一共應時代需要──從主所求的合一談起」（蕭克諧）、「高舉基督廣傳福音使命」（劉少康）、「九十年代的堂會使命」（李炳光）、「九十年代香港教會的社會使命」（吳水麗）、「肩負十字架、承擔牧萬民」（蔡元雲）。另有兩場查經聚會：「九十年代香港教會看耶利米的聖殿講道」（周永健）、「使徒行傳與九十年代香港教會使命」（周天和）。\n\n\n此外，與會者又分為十個小組：（1）在社會劇變中尋找教會的團結與合一；（2）與各國及國內教會的關懷與合作；（3）向處於轉變期的香港市民傳福音；（4）福音機構及信徒群體在轉變期的角色和配搭；（5）強化神學教育訓練以應時代挑戰；（6）轉變時期的堂會牧養工作；（7）轉變時期的教會社會服務；（8）轉變時期的教育事工；（9）推動信徒關懷民主政制的建設；（10）如何推動全民牧職。\n\n\n會議最後發表《九十年代香港教會使命宣言》，指香港「今後十年亦因身份轉化而充滿信心危機與焦慮」，如何「在艱困和疑慮中堅定貫徹歷久不變的使命，忠於上帝所託，回應時代挑戰，使危機化為轉變」，成為十年間教會的嚴峻考驗。宣言強調教會必須與香港廣大市民認同，「共度患難、疑慮與掙扎」，並對香港作長遠的委身。面對政治轉化，香港教會要按上帝公義之要求，「與港人尋求切合高度自治、體現人權、自由、民主、法治之玫制」。教會作為「時代先知」，要針對時弊，肩責言責，督促中英兩國貫徹《聯合聲明》，確保《基本漩》能達致建立尊重人權、秉行公義、平等博愛的社會。同時，教會面對九七回歸，「應致力參與培育香港人之民族意識」，承擔中國，「在中國現代化之進程中，作出貢獻」。\n\n\n1994年11月，協進會再舉辦「九十年代香港教會使命中期諮詢會議」，會後發表《致全港基督徒牧函》。\n\n\n(2) 我愛香港運動 We Love Hong Kong, 1991（香港基督教協進會1991：5-6）\n\n\n1988年11月，基督教協進會社會關注委員會議決推動一項題為「我愛香港」的活動，藉此增強香港人對香港的認同。不過，有關決議未有執行。及至八九六四後，移民人數大增，社會關注委員會認為有關活動有需要予以落實，並撰寫計劃書，近協進會執委會討論。內容是由香港教會及非教會的社會服務團體派出代表，組成「我愛香港運動委員會」，主辦「我愛香港」的活動。\n\n\n運動的目的包括：（1）肯定香港人熱愛香港，將社會注意力由移民轉移至留港的香港人身上，珍惜和熱愛生於斯長於斯的香港，並為其取得的成就感而自豪，從而達到對今後發展有更大的承擔感和責任感，減低香港人心理上的無力感，掃除世紀末心愈，以正面態度面對未來；（2）突出香港主人翁的身分，香港人的努力促成現代化的香港。計劃要讚賞香港人不畏險阻，創這一個個奇蹟的性格；（3）對香港的感情自白，藉行動表達對香港的情懷和盼望，成為香港人的愛港宣言；（4）肯定份與機構與香港前途一致，與香港民眾同甘同苦，體現90年代各機構及團體對香港的貢獻。\n\n\n在內容方面，公開活動包括徵文及繪畫比賽、公開標語比賽、我愛民主香港影子投票計劃、出版《我愛香港》，從學術角度探討愛港之途、主辦「我愛香港學術研討會」、攝影比賽；而教會方面，主辦「我愛香港聖樂崇拜」（10月12日在紅磡體育館）、愛港主日（1991年6月30日，並以每年7月1日定為「香港主日」）。\n\n\n參與團體方面，包括小童群益會、明愛小組及社區工作服務、中華基督教青年會、基督徒關懷香港學會、信義會社會服務協調處、天主教社會傳播處、天主教青年聯會、天主教教友總會、基督教協進會、基督教服務處、青年協會、路德會社會服務處、傷健協會、基督教女青年會、救世軍、聖雅各福群會。\n\n\n(3) 香港基督教訪京團1991（時代論壇1991a）\n\n\n1991年11月16至23日，應國務務宗教事務局邀請，香港基督教協進會籌組訪京團，這是自1984年香港基督教界首次官方訪京以來，七年後第一次的正式官方訪問，更是六四後中國政府首次邀請香港教會訪問，可視作雙方重建關係的第一步。\n\n\n訪問團由李炳光牧師（協進會主席）任團長，副團長為高苕華，總幹事兼書記為曹敏敬赦師及林澤。成員包括：伍山河（五旬節聖潔會永光堂主任牧師）、周主培（香港靈糧堂主任牧師）、周永健（中國神學研究院院長）、林和甫（循道衛理前任副會長）、林基甸（救世軍總部文字部主任）、陳克平（西區浸信會主任牧師）、許道良（播道神學院院長）、翁珏光（中華基督教會香港區會總幹事）、翁偉業（香港基督徒學生福音團契副總幹事）、趙文壁（香港中華基督教青年會副總幹事）、蓋英魁（香港信義會監督）、盧龍光（循道衛理會香港堂主任牧師）、鄺廣傑（聖公會港澳教區主教）、薛盤基（香港崇真會會長）、蕭開理（東南亞神召會港澳區議會會長）。\n\n\n訪京團擬定〈香港基督教人士北京訪問團意見書〉，內容包括「我們對香港社會的看法」及「我們對香港教會的看法」兩個主要部分。前者不諱言，自1989年以來，「港人更重視人權、法治及民主政制的發展」，並指1991年立法局首次直選說明「殖民地統治下的港人開始學習運用自己的政治權利，向九七後『高度自治，港人治港』的目標邁進了一大步」。又指香港基督徒與市民「憂戚與共」，在剛發起的「我愛香港運動」，即協助香港克服過渡期遇到的困難，期望順利完成九七主權回歸，使香港成為一個「繁榮、安定、民主、自由、法治的國際性中國城市」。而在後者分中，意見書重申香港基督教將繼續投入社會服務、參與學校教育、建立地方教會。面對「信心危機」，香港基督教以積極態度迎接九七及推展工作，希望為港人帶來信心與希望。「無論社會如何動盪，時代如何轉變，教會仍會珍惜所享有的自由，繼續努力服務港人，堅持承擔香港的責」。\n\n\n訪京團此行先後跟國務院宗教事務局局長任務之、港澳辦公室副主任陳滋英及中國基督教協會會長丁光訓會面。其中在跟陳滋英見面時，雙方也有觸及人權問題，陳提到中國公佈《中國的人權狀況白皮書》，指中國對人權的看法與西方不同。而任務之則再次肯定九七後香港將享有宗教自由，並按三互原則（互不极隸屬、互不干涉及互相對相尊重）作交流基礎。\n\n\n (4) \"Shaping the Future of the Church in the SAR\": Second Hong Kong Evangelical Conference, 1995 (Church Renewal Movement, 1995)\n\n\nFrom January 16–18, 1995, the Hong Kong Church Renewal Movement held the Second Hong Kong Evangelical Conference under the theme \"Shaping the Future of the Church in the SAR.\" The conference explored the direction of Hong Kong churches from biblical, theological, and contextual perspectives. Key topics included:\n\n- \"Defining the Mission of the Church\"\n\n- \"Practicing a Holistic Gospel\"\n\n- \"The Development of the Church in the SAR\"\n\n\nEvening sessions included revival meetings on themes such as \"The Role of the Church in the SAR under 'One Country, Two Systems'\" (Lo Lung-kwong), \"The Role of Believers in the SAR Church\" (Choi Yuen-wan), and \"The Evangelical Mission of the SAR Church\" (Lau Siu-hong).\n\n\nThe conference concluded with the issuance of the Declaration on the Mission of the Hong Kong Church in the SAR and a Letter to All Hong Kong Citizens. The letter addressed the unease and helplessness felt by Hong Kong citizens amidst Sino-British disputes. It expressed hope that after 1997, the principles of \"One Country, Two Systems,\" \"Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong,\" and \"High Degree of Autonomy\" would be fully implemented, enabling Hong Kong to become a place of democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. Additionally, it called on churches to address societal issues such as the overemphasis on economic benefits at the expense of life’s value and dignity. The Christian community was urged to denounce societal evils and, with humility and love, stand in solidarity with marginalized and neglected individuals.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) \"The Vision of Hong Kong,\" 1996 (Chen Shun-hing, 1998)\n\n\nOn October 9–10, 1996, the academic conference \"The Vision of Hong Kong\" was held at Chung Chi College, Chinese University of Hong Kong. Organized by the Divinity School of Chung Chi College, it was co-sponsored by the Christian Study Centre on Chinese Religion and Culture, the Christian Institute, and Christian Times. The conference aimed to address challenges to Christian faith brought by Hong Kong's changes leading up to 1997, strengthen ties with academia, and seek a collective vision for Hong Kong's development.\n\n\nScholars from various fields presented papers on 11 topics, including political, social, and economic development, human rights, media, environmental protection, women, education, religion, and international networks. Theological scholars provided responses to these papers. A concluding session featured reflections by Yu Tat-sum (China Graduate School of Theology), Lee Chi-cheung (Department of Religion, CUHK), Kwok Nai-hong (Christian Institute), and Hui Kam-yiu (Catholic Institute for Religion and Society).\n\n\nAhead of the conference, five Christian theologians—Ho Yat-sun, Lau Chi-yui, Tang Siu-kwong, Chow Kin-man, and Chen Shun-hing—issued a declaration titled The Vision of Hong Kong: A Hope from a Community of Christian Intellectuals, expressing their aspirations for Hong Kong's future. This was followed by a public forum in which Lo Lung-kwong (Divinity School of Chung Chi College), Lee Sze-kwang (China Graduate School of Theology), and Leung Ka-lun (Alliance Bible Seminary) offered critiques and responses.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) Revival Prayer Campaign for 1997, 1996–1997 (Ng Lai-ha & Cheung Yuk-yun, 1997; Cheung Fuk-ming, 1997)\n\n\nThe Chinese Christian Union organized the \"Revival Prayer Campaign for 1997\" under the theme \"Pray for Revival of the Church, Pray for Peace in Hong Kong.\" The campaign unfolded in five phases from July 1996 to July 1997:\n\n1. Starting in July 1996, churches encouraged believers to intercede for Hong Kong's political transition and social stability.\n\n2. From January to April 1997, churches held prayer meetings specifically for Hong Kong's governance and livelihood during the transition.\n\n3. On May 12, 1997 (50 days before the handover), a unified prayer meeting for clergy and church leaders demonstrated solidarity.\n\n4. On June 30, 1997, simultaneous prayer gatherings were held in Hong Kong (North Point Alliance Church) and Kowloon (Kowloon City Baptist Church).\n\n5. On July 1, 1997 (Sunday), \"Handover Sunday\" was observed with prayers for the nation and the city's peace.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (7) Hong Kong Christian Prayer Convention, 1997 (Ng Lai-ha & Cheung Yuk-yun, 1997; Christian Times, 1997a; Leung Ka-lun, 2002: 110-111)\n\n\nOn June 1, 1997, the Hong Kong Christian Council’s Mission Committee, together with 14 denominations and organizations, hosted the \"Hong Kong Christian Prayer Convention\" at Hong Kong Stadium. Approximately 10,000 people attended the event, themed \"Ten Thousand Prayers for 1997.\" Its goals included:\n\n1. Acknowledging the church’s past contributions to Hong Kong.\n\n2. Addressing future needs of society and the church.\n\n3. Standing in solidarity with Hong Kong citizens.\n\n4. Offering blessings for citizens, pastors, and believers.\n\n\nKeynote speakers included Pastor Lo Cho-shing (Tsung Tsin Mission of Hong Kong), Rev. Yu Tat-sum (Vice President of China Graduate School of Theology), and Rev. Ng Chun-chi (General Secretary of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China). Pastor Lo called for repentance and a renewed commitment to prayer, while Rev. Yu urged believers to bring peace and love to Hong Kong, acting as intercessors and setting aside the \"baggage\" of the Tiananmen Incident.\n\n\nPrayers were led by Christian leaders such as Elder Sit Pan-kee (HKCC Chairperson), Dr. Chan Shu-on (Chairperson of the Hong Kong Baptist Union), and other notable figures, focusing on post-handover evangelism, social services, church unity, prosperity, and justice.\n\n\nThe convention drew criticism from some believers who argued it risked being perceived as a compromise with the government, potentially damaging the church’s credibility.\n\n(4)「共塑特區教會明天」第二屆香港福音會議 1995（教會更新運動1995）\n\n\n1995年1月16至18日，香港教會更新運動召開第二屆香港福音會議，主題為「共塑特區教會明天」，從聖經、神學及處境三方面探索香港教會的路向。主題包括「教會使命的確立」、「整全福音的實踐」及「特區教會的發展」。晚上又有培靈會，分別以「一國兩制下的特區教會」（盧龍光）、「特區教會的信徒角色」（蔡元雲）及「特區教會的福音使命」（劉少康）為題。會後發表〈邁向特區：香港教會使命宣言〉及〈致全港市民書〉。其中在〈致全港市民書〉中，指出香港人面對中英爭拗，感到不安與無奈，但教會仍盼望九七後，一國兩制、港人治港、高度自治均能落實，不僅令香港變為民主自由、人權法治的地方，更為21世紀中國的富強與奮進，作出貢獻。此外，又指出教會關注香港社會只重經濟效益，忽略生命價值與尊嚴的問題，基督教群體必須指斥社會罪惡，並本基督的謙卑與慈愛，與社會上被遺棄及被忽視的人同在。\n\n\n(5) 「香港的遠象」The Vision of Hong Kong, 1996（陳慎慶 1998）\n\n\n1996年10月9至10日，「香港的遠象」學術研討會在中文大學崇基學院舉行，研討會由崇基神學組主辦，基督徒學會、基督教中國宗教文化研究社及時代論壇協辦。大會的緣起，是針對香港九七的改變對基督教信仰帶來的挑戰，藉此機會表達基督教社群對香港社會的關注，，並加強與學術界的聯結，並同尋求香港發展的遠象。因此，研討會邀請不同範疇的學者就政治發展、社會發展、經濟發展、汰制、人權、傳媒、環保、婦女、教育、宗教及國際網絡等11方面發表專文，再由神學工作者作回應。最後總結討論部分，由余達心（中國神學研究院）、李熾昌（中文大學宗教系）、郭乃弘（基督徒學會）及徐錦堯（天主教教研中心）作總結回應。\n\n\n除研討外，大會邀請了何溢信、劉子睿、鄧紹光、周健文及陳慎慶五位基督教神學工作者為會議撰寫題為〈香港的遠象：一群基督徒的盼望〉的宣言，在會議開始前宣讀。宣言以「一群以香港為家、信仰耶穌基督的知識分子」作定位，提出對未來香港社會的遠景。然後又舉辦一場公開聚會，由盧龍光（崇基神學組）、李思敬（中國神學研究院）及梁家麟（建道神學院）對宣言作批評及回應。\n\n\n(6) 迎九七復興聯禱會 1996-1997（吳麗霞、張玉雲1997；張福民1997）\n\n\n華人基督教聯會主辦「迎九七求復興聯禱會」，大會口號是「為教會求復興，為香港求平安」。由1996年7月至1997年7月，共分五個階段舉行：（1）1996年7月開始，籲請香港教會鼓勵信徒為香港政權過渡及社會民生代求；（2）1997年1月至4月，請各教會在祈禱會或特定聚會，懇切為香港政權過渡及社會民生代求；（3）1997年5月12日（回歸倒數50日），舉行全港教牧同工及信徒領袖祈禱會，建立合一同心聯禱的見證；（4）1997年6月30日，分香港（北角宣道會）及九龍（九龍城浸信會）兩區舉行；（5）1997年7月1日（主日）舉行「回歸主日」，為國禱告，為城求平安。\n\n\n(7) 香港基督徒祈福大會 Hong Kong Christian Prayer Convention,  1997（吳麗霞、張玉雲1997；時代論壇1997a；梁家麟2002：110-111）\n\n\n由香港基督教協進會宣教事工委員會主催，14個宗派及機構合辦的「香港基督徒祈福大會」於1997年6月1日假香港大球場舉行，大會估計有近一萬人次參加。大會的口號是「萬人禱告迎向九七」，希望帶出四方面的信息：（1）見證香港教會過去的貢獻；（2）承擔未來社會及教會的需要；（3）與香港市民同行；（4）為市民、教牧及信徒祈福。\n\n\n大會由崇真會救恩堂羅祖澄牧師、中國神學研究院副院長余達心牧師及中華基督教會香港區會總幹事吳振智牧師分享信息。羅要求會眾認罪悔改，重新重視禱告，並向主祈求自己能為香港恆切禱告。而余則指香港人在過渡期一直不能掌握自己的命運和前途，出現冷漠及自我中心。他要求信徒和教會將平安和愛帶到香港人之中，成為中保，並放下「六四」的「包袱」。\n\n\n並由基督教協進會主席薛磐基長老、香港浸信會聯會主席陳樹安博士、香港全備福音商人團契陳世強律師及一位候任裁判司信徒袁歐陽桂如領禱，為九七後香港的福音廣傳、社會服務、教會合一、繁榮安定、政府廉潔和人權公義等禱告。\n\n\n祈福會的舉行，也引起信徒的異議，指其會令市民誤會教會「擦鞋」，與政權妥協，令教會失去公信力。\n\n\n (8) Tian Feng Special Edition on the 1997 Handover (Tian Feng, 1997: 2-18)\n\n\nIn its July 1997 issue, Tian Feng, the official publication of China's Christian patriotic organizations, featured a special column celebrating the handover of Hong Kong to China. The editorial, titled \"Washing Away the Shame of a Century, Celebrating Hong Kong's Return,\" asserted that Hong Kong \"has always been Chinese territory,\" referencing its cession due to British colonialism during the Opium Wars, followed by the cession of the Kowloon Peninsula and the lease of the New Territories. The editorial described China's descent into semi-colonial and semi-feudal status as beginning with the loss of Hong Kong. It emphasized that Hong Kong’s past prosperity was primarily due to \"the contributions of Hong Kong's Chinese majority,\" supported by new China and the mainland's economic development.\n\n\nRegarding the relationship between Chinese and Hong Kong churches, the editorial highlighted their shared ethnic and spiritual ties, suggesting that under the \"three-self\" principle (self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation), the churches could bear strong witness locally. This view reflected a nationalist historical perspective. Han Wenzao, president of the China Christian Council, interpreted the handover as \"the realization of God's justice\" and the end of colonialism.\n\n\nThe issue also included an article titled \"Hong Kong’s Occupation and the Exploitation of Christianity by Imperialism,\" linking Hong Kong's history with Christianity's role in colonialism. Contributions from Hong Kong Christian leaders, such as Anglican Bishop Kwong Kong-kit, further explored the handover’s significance. Kwong emphasized the deep national sentiment uniting mainland and Hong Kong churches, stating that post-handover, they shared \"one hope and one mission.\" He criticized the self-centeredness of some Hong Kong churches and discouraged envy of their materialism. Kwong called for greater collaboration between churches in social care and service.\n\n\nOther contributors included HKCC General Secretary Cho Man-king, who described the handover as \"the birth of a new era\" and predicted stronger ties between Hong Kong Christians and the mainland, contributing to China’s progress toward becoming a modern, just, and democratic state. Lee Chi-kong, chairperson of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union, characterized the handover as \"God’s will,\" emphasizing that love for the nation aligns with Christian principles.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (9) The World Lutheran Federation Controversy, 1997 (Christian Times, 1996a, 1996b, 1997b; Leung Ka-lun, 2002: 106-107)\n\n\nFrom July 8–16, 1997, the World Lutheran Federation (WLF) planned to hold its 50th-anniversary international conference at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Preparations began in 1993–94, with notifications sent to the Hong Kong government, the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and Xinhua News Agency’s Hong Kong branch. While Xinhua initially approved the event, in February 1996, it notified organizers of \"technical difficulties\" due to overlapping celebrations for the handover. Xinhua suggested discussing the matter with the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. \n\n\nIn March 1996, Xinhua Hong Kong’s director suggested the WLF could decide to postpone or proceed with the event. WLF General Secretary Ishmael Noko visited Beijing and Hong Kong to negotiate with officials. Ultimately, the WLF announced that the conference would proceed as planned.\n\n\nThe controversy sparked criticism of China for allegedly interfering with religious and assembly freedoms. Six Christian organizations, including the Christian Industrial Committee and the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission, issued a joint statement opposing the politicization of civil activities. Despite the tensions, the conference took place as scheduled. Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa attended and assured that religious freedoms would continue post-handover. However, a proposed statement on China’s human rights issues was withdrawn after opposition from Hong Kong delegates, who feared it would create tension for local Lutheran churches.\n\n\nThe conference included representatives from 122 member churches across 68 countries, drawing 400 delegates and 1,000 observers, advisors, and guests.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (10) Consultation on the Mission of the Hong Kong Church in the 21st Century, 1999 (HKCC, 2020)\n\n\nFrom November 22–24, 1999, the HKCC hosted the \"Consultation on the Mission of the Hong Kong Church in the 21st Century\" under the theme \"Exploring the Way Forward, Meeting Challenges, and Embracing a New Mission for the Century.\" The consultation featured lectures on three main areas:\n\n1. \"Hong Kong in the 21st Century\": globalization (Wen Jiehua), the economy (Song Enrong), and social development (Chan Kin-man).\n\n2. \"The Hong Kong Church in the 21st Century\": Li Kam-hung and Lo Lung-kwong.\n\n3. \"Practicing a United Mission\": the ecumenical movement (So Shing-yip and Pang Kin-sun) and church pastoral work (Lau Siu-hong).\n\n\nBible study sessions were held by Dai Ho-fai and Yu Tat-sum, and the conference included ten workshops covering topics such as family ministry, education, social ethics, globalization, and cross-cultural mission. A public forum led by Choi Yuen-wan was also held.\n\n\nThe conference’s Declaration acknowledged past shortcomings in addressing systemic injustice and supporting victims of inequality. It outlined a vision for the 21st century where the church would \"stand with Hong Kong people, sharing God's love\" while serving as a \"bridge\" during the implementation of \"One Country, Two Systems.\" The declaration called for openness to new perspectives while preserving the unique identity of Hong Kong churches. It also urged action against social polarization caused by globalization, advocating for policies and cultural values that prioritize justice and human dignity. The church was called to support victims of systemic injustices and work toward a harmonious and inclusive society.\n\n(8) 《天風》九七「回歸」專輯1997（天風1997：2-18）\n\n\n中國基督教愛國團體的機關刊物《天風》於1997年7月號中，特設「慶香港回歸專欄」。「社論」以「洗雪百年國恥，歡慶香港回歸」為題，指香港「自古以來就是中國的領土」，由於英國殖民主義者發動鴉片戰爭，迫使清政府割讓香港島，隨後再割讓九龍半島及租借新界。社論形容「中國遭受列強侵略，並逐步受淪為半殖民地半封建社會，正是從……香況被佔開始的」。又強調，香港「過去的繁榮」，主要是「以中國人為主體的香港人創造出來的。」加上新中國的「支持和大陸的經濟發展分不開的」。面對回歸祖國，社論指中港教會在「三互」原則下，「具有民一民族淵源，同一信仰期望，同一愛心服事的兩地教會，必能根據各自的情況，在當地為主作出美好的見證」。可以說，社論主是從中國民族史觀為立論。中國基督教協會會長韓文藻以「上帝公義的伸張」來詮釋「殖民主義的終結」。專輯中，特別刊有〈香港被佔與帝國主義利用基督教〉一文，將香港的歷史，與基督教與帝國主義、殖民主義侵略中國連在一起。\n\n\n此外，專輯也收入香港基督教人士如何理解九七「回歸」，包括聖公會港澳教區主教鄺廣傑接受專訪，指「香港與內地教會維繫著深厚的民族感情」。九七後，「我們不僅同屬一個民族丙，且有同一指望和同一使命」。他認為香港教會的危機是「過於自我為中心，目空一切」。他強調不應羨慕香港教會「表面的物質化現象」。日後兩地教會可以在社會關懷、服務方面多些合作。此外，基督教協進會總幹事曹敏敬以〈歸心似箭〉撰文，表示九七是「新時代的誕生」，「香港人的中國心與祖國情在回歸後必然比前更濃厚，更不以協助祖國成為更富強、公義、自由、民主及現代化的國家，能在二十一世紀的世界舞台上發揮更大作用，與各國人民共同建造一個新的世界秩序」。香港華人基督教聯會主席李志剛，更指「香港回歸體認上帝的旨意」，1997不僅是歷史的時刻，「更是上帝的時刻，因為上帝是歷史的主宰。」在「回歸的時刻」中，「必然有上帝的美意」。因此，身為中國人，「愛國可說是天地經義的事，香港信徒也不例外」。\n\n\n(9) 世界信義宗大會風波1997（時代論壇1996a，1996b，1997b；梁家麟2002：106-107）\n\n\n1997年7月8日至16日，世界信義宗聯會原計劃在香港會議展覽中心舉行五十周年國際會議。大會早於1993至94年，便知會香港政府、國務院港澳辦新華社香港分社。1995年獲新華社香港分社回覆，1997年在港舉行大會沒有問題。不過，在1996年2月，主辦方收到新華社香港分社通知，指因九七慶祝回歸活動頻繁，舉行大型會議有「技術困難」。後來又指活動需提交中英聯絡小組討論。3月初，新華社香港分社社長張浚生向聯會港區代表表示，信義宗可自行決定延期或如期舉行。信義宗總會總幹事羅谷（Ishmael Noko）訪京，與國務院宗教事務局及港澈辦官員見面，後再來港與新華社香港分社官員見面。隨後，信義宗召開記者會，宣佈大會如期舉行。\n\n\n事件引廣大風波，有批評中國政府干預宗教自由及集會自由。2月28日，基督教工業委員會、基督徒婦女協會、基督徒關懷香港學會、基督勞工教會、天主教正義和平委員會及深愛堂關社團契就事件發表聯署聲明，指民間活動不應政治化，批評新華社香港分社提議交中英聯絡小組討論，是對結社集會自由的干預。最後會議如期舉行。特首董健華出席大會，講話中保證香港今後仍有宗教自由。不過，大會原擬就中國人權問題發表聲明，但與會香港代表大多反對，認為此舉會令香港信義宗教會尷尬，經投票後決定收回聲明。\n\n\n世界信義宗聯會由全球68個國家122個會員教會組成，每7年舉行一次國際會議。大會有400名各地信義宗教會代表及1000名觀察員、顧問、嘉賓參與。\n\n\n(10)廿一世紀香港教會使命諮詢會議」1999（香港基督教協進會2020）\n\n\n1999年11月22至24日，香港基督教協進會主辦「廿一世紀香港教會使命諮詢會議」，主題為「探前路．迎挑戰．共負世紀新使命」。專題講座分三大方向：（1）「廿一世紀的香港」：全球化（文潔華）、香港經濟（宋恩榮）、社會發展（陳健民）；（2）「廿一世紀的香港教會」：李錦洪、盧龍光；（3）「聯合使命的實踐」：合一運動（蘇成溢、龐建新）、堂會牧養（劉少康）。在專題講座前，另安排查經（戴浩輝、余達心）。此外，大會又設十個工作坊：家庭事工、弱勢群體、教育關注、資訊科投應用、合一運動深化、內地事工、社會倫理、堂會牧養、普世宣教、外籍信徒在港面對的問題。會議又安排了由蔡元雲主講的公開聚會。\n\n\n會議 公布〈大會宣言〉，承認過去對「制度建立及政策釐定」的關注不足，未能充分顧及「因而衍生的不公現象及不良風氣下的受害者」。而對21世紀的挑戰，提出既「立足香港、與港人同甘共苦，分享上主慈愛」，也要「面向內地，在蒼落實一國兩制過程中扮演橋樑角色」，並不忘「胸懷世界」，在不同種族及階層人群中見證上主。最後，宣言呼籲各堂會、宗派、福音機構及聯合組織對因社會變遷而出現的「新思維」持開放態度接受，「同時要致力保持帶有香港特色的教會文化」。同時，要關注全球化帶來「社會的極化現象」，如貧富懸殊、非人性化生活等，要本實踐公義及以人為本的信念，關注公共政策的制定及社會文化的塑造，「具體支援制度中的受害者」，努力建設「和諧共融的社會」。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromotion of Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) romanization and establishment of Taiwan Prefectural City Church News\n\nMissionaries such as George Leslie Mackay, William Gauld, and Thomas Barclay vigorously promoted the use of the Minnan language Pe̍h-ōe-jī romanization system established in Xiamen. Barclay advocated that for the church to be strong, every member, regardless of gender, should be able to read the Bible independently, a feat unattainable through Chinese characters but achievable through Romanized Vernacular. He claimed that ordinary people could learn to read a whole Bible in Romanized Vernacular within 4 to 5 weeks, far more efficiently than with Chinese characters. He cited Dr. Bonfield of the British and Foreign Bible Society, who observed that church believers in Taiwan could read the Bible better than believers in other Chinese churches, attributing this to Pe̍h-ōe-jī. He believed that Chinese characters and Romanization were not in opposition but could be seen as complementary means of learning. In 1885, Barclay issued the inaugural edition of the Taiwan Prefectural City Church News, Taiwan's first newspaper, which became a crucial medium for promoting Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Earlier, he organized a large meeting in Tainan where believers freely expressed themselves. He later excerpted these speeches and published them in the Taiwan Prefectural City Church News. People were delighted to see their speeches printed in typeface, leading to an increase in circulation, from 500 copies shortly after its launch to 670 copies within two years, and reaching 700 copies by 1897. Issues one to three of the newspaper reported on the earlier essay contest titled \"The Benefits of Pe̍h-ōe-jī\" held in Xiamen, extensively reprinting the articles of the top four contestants: Yeh Hanzhang (Zhangzhou Xiaoxi), Liu Maoqing (Taiwan Prefectural City), Li Chalai (Gulangyu), Huang Deshan (Xiamen), and Lu Sanyuan (Gulangyu), to promote Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Especially, Taiwanese contestant Liu Maoqing highlighted the benefits of Pe̍h-ōe-jī from the perspective of social equality, emphasizing its accessibility to those who couldn't receive Chinese character education, allowing them to acquire knowledge through Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Pe̍h-ōe-jī wasn't limited to religious texts but also encompassed linguistics, medicine, literature education, Chinese history, applied literature, and fiction. It not only fulfilled the missionaries' expectation of enhancing faith knowledge but also served as a vehicle for accessing modern knowledge (Chen Muzhen 2015: 73).\n\n\n推行白話字以及《台灣府城教會報》的創刊（Promotion of Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) romanization and establishment of Taiwan Prefectural City Church News）。馬雅各、甘為霖、巴克禮等宣教士來台後戮力推行宣教士在廈門創立的閩南語白話字書寫系統，巴克禮主張若教會要健全，無論男女每一位會友都要能自己閱讀聖經，但這點不能藉助漢字達成，只有羅馬字（Romanized Vernacular）可以。他表示一般人能在4到5週學會閱讀整本羅馬字聖經，效率遠勝漢字。他指出大英聖書公會文顯理博士（Dr. Bonfield）觀察到，台灣教會信徒比其他中國教會信徒更能閱讀聖經，巴克禮歸功於白話字。他認為漢字和羅馬字並非對立，而可以理解為學習漢字的手段。1885年巴克禮發行首期《台灣府城教會報》，是台灣第一份報紙，即成推行白話字的重要媒介。在此稍早他在台南辦了一場大會，讓信徒暢所欲言，過後他將這些發言摘錄，刊於《台灣府城教會報》，人們初次見到自己的發言被印成鉛字而感到欣喜，也促使該報發行量攀升，創刊不到兩年即從500份升至670份，1897年到700份之譜（巴克禮181-182、283-286；陳慕真2015：63-65、70）。該報一至三期更是報導稍早廈門舉辦的「白話字的利益」徵文比賽，並大幅轉刊前四名參賽作者葉漢章（漳州小溪）、劉茂清（台灣府城）、李插來（鼓浪嶼）、黃德善（廈門）、盧三源（鼓浪嶼）的文章，以推行白話字。尤其台籍劉茂清更是由階級平等的觀點提出白話字的益處，即普羅大眾性，當時無法接受漢字教育者均能透過白話字吸收知識。而白話字不限於印行宗教文獻，還包含語言學、醫學、文學教育、中國歷史、應用文、小說，不僅達致宣教士期望的增進信仰知識，也是接觸現代新知的載體（陳慕真2015：73）。\n\n\n\nApostolic Nuncio Mario Giardini visited Taiwan. In 1913, the Catholic Church in Taiwan separated from the Apostolic Vicariate of Amoy and became the Apostolic Prefecture of Taiwan, starting to engage more with Spanish Dominicans from the Apostolic Vicariate of Shikoku in Japan and gradually reducing its ties to China. In the spring of 1923, the Apostolic Nuncio to Japan, Mario Giardini, visited Taiwan. He arrived in Keelung on January 15, where he was received by officials from the Governor-General's Office and met with consular officers from the UK, US, and Netherlands. He also visited the Dominican-established St. Joseph Technical High School for Girls.\n\n\n教廷使節Mario Giardini來台巡視（Apostolic Nuncio Mario Giardini visited Taiwan）。1913年台灣天主教會脫離廈門監牧區，獨立成台灣監牧區，開始與日本四國監牧區西班牙道明會士多有交流，逐漸去中國化。1923年春駐日教廷使節Mario Giardini來台巡視，1月15日抵達基隆，總督府人員予以接待，並與英、美、荷蘭領事等外國駐台官員會面，此外參觀道明會建立的靜修女中。\n\n\nGiardini then traveled to Taichung for further visits, proceeded to Kaohsiung in the south where he toured an orphanage, and went to Wanjin in Pingtung to meet indigenous Catholic converts. Returning to Kaohsiung, he donated 500 yen for the reconstruction of the Wuquai Church. He continued his tour to Tainan, where he attended a Taiwanese language evangelistic meeting, and then visited Pujianglun Church, passing through Douliu Church, hosted by Taiwan Sugar Corporation, and on to Tianzhong Church. He traveled from Tianzhong to Yuanlin Church and then to Luocuo Village, finally returning to Taipei via Yuanlin, departing from Keelung for Japan on February 1.\n\n\n後轉往台中，參觀，再往南部高雄，參觀孤兒院，又到屏東萬金，訪問原住民教友，再回高雄，並贈金五百元重建五塊厝教堂。後北上臺南，再參加台語佈道會；訪畢由台南前往埔羌崙教會，途中順便經過斗南教會，接受台糖公司接待，再到斗六教會，再赴田中教會，從田中到員林教會，再到羅厝莊，最後才取道員林返回臺北，2月1日從基隆返日。\n\n\nGiardini expressed being deeply impressed by the Dominican mission work in Taiwan. He was accompanied by Fr. Hisanobu Hayasaka, who documented the trip in a series of articles titled \"Taiwan Snippets: Accompanying the Nuncio,\" published in three installments in the Japanese Catholic magazine \"The Voice.\" These articles reflected the state of the Catholic Church in Taiwan to the Japanese Catholic community and included some personal interpretations of Taiwanese customs and social conditions, sometimes revealing a colonial or Orientalist perspective. This visit highlighted the globalization and localization of the Catholic Church in Taiwan, its independence from the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Chinese Catholic Church, and the establishment of its relationship with the Japanese Church (Ku Wei-ying 2008: 315-347; Ku Wei-ying 2008: 166).\n\n\nGiardini表示對道明會在台灣的傳教工作印象深刻。此次教廷使節巡視由秘書早坂久之助神父陪同，並就此行寫下〈台灣拾掇：伴隨使節記行〉，分為三次在日本天主教刊物《聲》刊登，向日本天主教界反映台灣天主教會實況。本文同時報導台灣風土民情，對此有一些個人詮釋，難免略有殖民者觀點或東方主義的再現。此次巡訪凸顯台灣天主教會的全球在地化，也凸顯其已脫離中國的天主教會教階制度體系而獨立，並與日本教會建立關係（古偉瀛2008：315-347；古偉瀛2008：166）。\n\n\n**Establishment of the United Church of Canada**\n\n\nThe parent church of the Northern Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Presbyterian Church in Canada, negotiated a union with the Methodist Church and the Congregational Church in the early 20th century. In September 1924, the church split into the \"United Church of Canada,\" which supported the union, and the \"Presbyterian Church in Canada,\" which opposed the union and advocated maintaining the original denomination. By June 10, 1925, the Methodist Church had 4,797 churches, the Congregational Church had 166 churches, and the Presbyterian Church had 3,728 churches, totaling 8,691 churches joining the \"United Church.\" There were 784 churches that did not join the \"United Church.\" Among the overseas missionaries of the three denominations, 655 joined the \"United Church,\" while only 17 did not.\n\n\n加拿大聯合教會成立（Establishment of the United Church of Canada）。北部長老教會的母會加拿大長老教會在二十世紀初協議與衛理公會、公理會聯合。1924年9月分裂為贊成聯合的「加拿大聯合教會」（United Church of Canada）和不贊成聯合而主張維持原來見制的「加拿大長老教會」（Presbyterian Church in Canada ）。至1925年6月10日，衛理公會有4797所教會，公理會有166所教會，長老教會有3728所教會，共8691所教會參加「聯合教會」 ，而未加入「聯合教會」的有784間。而三個教派駐在海外之傳教士，其加入「 聯合教會」者有655名，未加入者僅有17名。\n\n\nIn September 1925, when the \"Presbyterian Church in Canada\" delineated foreign mission areas, the northern Taiwan mission area remained under the \"Presbyterian Church.\" It was decided that from early 1927, the \"Presbyterian Church in Canada\" would assume the management of the northern Taiwan mission area. This caused issues for the missionaries of the \"United Church of Canada\" in northern Taiwan, leading some to leave and others to transfer to the south. As a result, the number of missionaries in the northern Presbyterian Church drastically decreased, losing many experienced senior missionaries, which significantly impacted the church's development (Huang Wudong & Xu Qianxin 1962: 174-175).\n\n\n「加拿大長老教會」於1925年9月在劃定異邦宣道區時，臺灣北部宣道區仍舊歸屬於「長老教會」，並訂於1927年初起「加拿大長老教會」擬承擔臺灣北部宣道區的管理。此事造成「加拿大聯合教會」之北部臺灣的宣教士的進退問題，而後有的離開，有的轉往南部。北部長老教會宣教士因而驟減，失去不少經驗豐富的資深宣教士，為該會發展帶來衝擊（黃武東、徐謙信1962：174-175）。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from the founding of institutions, there were few major movements or events during this period. For both missions, it was a period of slow growth and foundation building. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decade that started with the Boxers initiated a significant period of institutional growth as the Christian missions renewed their work with a renewed sense of purpose, a more friendly (or at least less overtly hostile) political setting, and increased resources coming from home and from the Boxer indemnity. \n\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the Boxers left both missions in a state of shock and disarray. By their own accounts, much of the work of previous decades was disrupted if not destroyed. This was particularly true of the physical infrastructure of schools, churches and dispensaries. The loss of life was significant, but generally regarded as a trial, possibly one sent by God, to test and strengthen the new church, and one in which any suffering would be amply rewarded in Heaven. (Both missions made frequent comparisons to the martyrs of the early Church)\n\n\nThe Catholic mission was physically destroyed. Physical destruction included the burning of the church and residences in Mukden and the smaller, much more recent start on a church in Jilin. It is not mentioned whether there was damage to other physical infrastructure such as the seminary in Chaling, which leads me to suspect that these assets were not harmed. The Protestant mission had a much less permanent physical presence, renting instead of owning property for schools, chapels and dispensaries, and the physical damage was less severe. \n\n\nBoth emerged from the period energized and flush with resources, and both embarked on a period of building. The Catholic missions rebuilt the destroyed church in Shenyang. The Protestant missions completed work on the Union Theological College (Boyd 64), which had been started in 1900, and on the medical school.\n\n\nThe Protestant church also entered what it called the Manchurian Revival. Beginning with a spontaneous revival meeting in Liaoyang during Spring Festival of 1908, this movement was replicated up and down the railway over the next few months. The Manchurian Revival was part of a global movement, one that followed a spike in global revivalism, including in Wales (1904–1905), Pyongyang (1903) and across the Anglophone world over the previous decades. The Manchurian Revival did replicate a global phenomenon (coming slightly later than revivals in Ireland, the United States and New Zealand, among others), but the effervescence of the movement was fundamentally a spontaneous reaction to the new sense of opportunity and optimism. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic sources emphasize the good political relations enjoyed during this period. As stated in the annual report from 1922, “We could not flatter ourselves to have the sympathy of the civil authorities and military, but it is right to recognize that demonstrations of hostility are rare and that in several circumstances, we profited from a rather benevolent neutrality.” \n\n\nAnother describes a Catholic ceremony in Changchun presided over by Bishop Lalouyer, and attended by numerous Chinese and international notables: Lépissier, the French Consul to Harbin, a French member of the East China Railway technical council, the Japanese Consul (of Changchun, presumably), the “Chinese General in charge of Changchun” [sic], the prefect, the chief of police, the first two judges of the court, and several members of various administrations. Assuming that few if any of the assembled dignitaries were themselves Catholic, this was a display of political support. A similar scene is described at a procession in Harbin, with the city’s Polish population turning out in large numbers.\n\n\nThe state of the Catholic Church in (1898) compared to 1922\n\n\nCatholic population (6,556) 27,000 [I believe this figure is baptized only]\n\nIndigenous priests (3) 16\n\nSeminaries (1) 2\n\nSeminary pupils (12) 41\n\nReligious Communities (1) 4 [it is my understanding that these are nuns]\n\nChurches (14) 73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a movement as such, but the incorporation of the Catholic Church into the heavily engineered religious structure of Manchukuo was one that unquestionably would have been perceived as potentially friendly by some.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n### Section: Key theological, doctrinal, or ecclesiastic issues in this decade, if any\n\n\n\nDivision of the Korean Presbyterian Church\n\n\nThe 1950s witnessed a series of schisms within the Korean Presbyterian Church, marking one of the most transformative and divisive decades in its history. These divisions were not merely administrative, but rather the result of deep theological disagreements, divergent political ideologies, and contrasting interpretations of church polity. Central to this period were three major breakaways: the Kosin denomination in 1952, the Korean Christian Church (Kijang) in 1953, and the split between Tonghap and Hapdong in 1959. Each schism revealed underlying tensions related to doctrine, church governance, and the global ecumenical movement, and each group developed distinct constitutional responses to these challenges.\n\n\nHistorical and Theological Background\n\nTheological divergence began brewing in the 1930s and 40s, especially concerning modernist and fundamentalist approaches to scripture, the role of the church in society, and the interpretation of confessions. The immediate post-war years intensified these debates. The Kosin group separated over issues of Shinto shrine worship and doctrinal purity. The formation of the Kijang denomination stemmed from conflicts surrounding Rev. Kim Jae-joon and Chosun Seminary, particularly the desire to preserve freedom of theological inquiry. Finally, the Tonghap–Hapdong split in 1959 centered around ecumenical engagement, the WCC, and internal church politics involving delegate selection and financial scandals.\n\n\nThe formation of Kijang and Its Constitutional Vision\n\nThe Korean Christian Church (Kijang) was officially formed in 1953, soon after the 1952 General Assembly removed Rev. Kim Jae-joon from ministry. The Kijang church prioritized freedom of conscience, historical-critical theology, and a socially engaged gospel. Its constitutional development reflected these values. In 1956, the denomination revised the polity section of its constitution, abolishing traditional learner classes, introducing the office of assistant pastors, and authorizing the ordination of women. In 1972, the church adopted a new Confession of Faith that emphasized contextual and reconciliation-oriented theology, moving beyond the Westminster Confession.\n\n\nThe Tonghap-Hapdong Division and Conflicting Politics\n\nThe 1959 General Assembly in Daejeon became the setting for the final rupture between conservatives aligned with the NAE (National Association of Evangelicals) and moderates who accepted participation in the WCC under conditions. The controversy over the Gyeonggi Presbytery’s delegate list and the General Assembly’s vote to accept delegates from an 'irregular' session resulted in the NAE faction walking out and forming a separate body. Tonghap emphasized church unity, mission, and ecumenical openness, while Hapdong focused on doctrinal exclusivity and anti-ecumenism. Their divergent approaches became codified in their respective constitutions and theological education systems.\n\n\nTable 1. Key Issues in Schism and Comparative Positions\n\n| Issue | Tonghap (Unified) Perspective | Hapdong (Separated) Perspective |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Immediate Cause | Political conflict post Park Hyung-ryong’s financial scandal | WCC participation and ecumenical deviation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stance on WCC | Initially neutral, later conditionally accepted withdrawal | Strongly opposed, framed as liberal and pro-communist |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Role of NAE | Criticized as a church power bloc | Seen as representing true evangelical identity |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gyeonggi Presbytery Incident | Emphasis on procedural legitimacy and reorganization | Claimed voting fraud and maintained legitimacy of regular presbytery |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| General Assembly Procedure | Asserted democratic decision-making through official vote | Denounced result as illegitimate due to missionary influence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Role of Missionaries | Criticized for taking sides and supporting ecumenical camp | Viewed as political interference and a threat to church autonomy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nTable 2. Major Figures and Theological Alignment\n\n| Figure | Affiliation / Role | Theological Orientation | Summary of Position |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Park Hyung-ryong | Presbyterian Seminary / Hapdong | Conservative Reformed | Anti-WCC; shifted to a political stance post-scandal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kim Jae-joon | Chosun Seminary / Kijang | Liberal Protestant | Advocated theological freedom and progressive theology |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Han Kyung-jik | Moderate / Tonghap leader | Ecumenically supportive | Actively engaged in church unity and international dialogue |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ahn Kwang-kuk | Gyeonggi Presbytery leader / Hapdong | Conservative, power-focused | Led delegate election and separation from the Assembly |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n*The 1922 Constitution and Presbyterian Polity Principles\n\nThe 1922 Constitution was a foundational document for all major Presbyterian groups in Korea. Based on American Presbyterianism, it incorporated key principles of governance that initially unified the church. These included:\n\nRepresentative government: authority resides in elected elders and ministers.\n\nCollegial leadership: governance is shared through a hierarchy of church courts.\n\nConstitutionalism: church governance must conform to established written laws.\n\nConnectionalism: congregations are part of a wider web of mutual accountability.\n\nOver time, the interpretation of these principles diverged. Kijang adapted them flexibly for contextual mission, Tonghap maintained a centralized polity emphasizing unity and outreach, and Hapdong focused on strict adherence and local church purity.\n\n\n**Comparative Analysis of the Constitutions of Three Major Korean Presbyterian Denominations\n\n\nThe Korean Christian Church (Kijang), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap), and the General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong), these churches diverged in the 1950s due to theological, political, and ecclesiological differences. Their constitutions reflect distinct theological commitments, ecclesial structures, and responses to modernity, ecumenism, and gender inclusion. Below is a structured comparison of their constitutional principles.\n\n\nTable 3. Comparative Overview of Constitutional Differences\n\n| Category | Kijang (Korean Christian Church) | Tonghap (Presbyterian Church of Korea) | Hapdong (General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Confession of Faith | 1972 Confession emphasizing historical and contemporary theology (e.g., Barmen, Nicene). | Westminster Confession + 12 creeds with adaptive interpretations. | Strict adherence to Westminster Confession with conservative interpretation. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amendment Approach | Actively revised in response to theology and mission needs. | Moderate openness to revision with procedural emphasis. | Very cautious; preservation of original doctrines. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ordination of Women | Ordained women as elders (1974) and pastors (1994). | Women elders allowed; pastors permitted since 2014 in some presbyteries. | No female ordination; women serve only as deaconesses. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Church Government | General Assembly-centered; ecumenical emphasis. | General Assembly-focused with collaborative polity. | Presbytery-focused; local autonomy and orthodoxy emphasized. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ecumenical Engagement | Active member of WCC, WARC, NCC. | Conditionally cooperative with WCC and global bodies. | Strongly opposed to WCC; anti-ecumenical stance. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Seminary and Theology | Progressive theological education (Hanshin Univ.). | Evangelical and holistic theology (Presbyterian Univ. & Theological Seminary). | Conservative Reformed theology (Chongshin Seminary). |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Church Discipline | Focused on restoration and dialogue over punishment. | Balanced legal procedure and ecclesial integrity. | Strict application; disciplinary measures against heresy. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Worship and Liturgy | Flexible, culturally adapted worship. | Traditional but open to modernization. | Strict adherence to traditional Reformed liturgy. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nTable 4. Summary of Constitutional Tendencies\n\n| Aspect | Kijang | Tonghap | Hapdong |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| General Theological Orientation | Progressive | Moderate | Conservative |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stance on Ecumenism | Fully Supportive | Conditional | Opposed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Women in Leadership | Fully Inclusive | Partially Inclusive | Exclusive |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Constitutional Interpretation | Contextual and Adaptive | Balanced and Practical | Literal and Protective |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThe constitutional structures of the three Presbyterian denominations reveal their broader theological and ecclesiological commitments. Kijang emphasizes progressive theology and contextual application of tradition, Tonghap balances evangelical faith with adaptive unity, and Hapdong strongly defends conservative orthodoxy and polity. These differences continue to shape their engagement with society, global Christianity, and internal governance.\n\n\nDivision, Unification, and the Emergence of New Denominations: Korean Methodist Church and Other Denominations\n\nThe 1950s was a transformative era for Korean Christianity. Following liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Korea faced internal religious conflict, political upheaval, and the Korean War. These challenges catalyzed divisions, reunifications, and the formation of new denominations across Protestant churches, especially within the Korean Methodist Church. These developments reflected not merely political strife but deep theological and ecclesial concerns about purity, identity, and leadership in the post-colonial church.\n\n\nDivision within the Methodist Church: The Rebuilding Group vs. the Revival Group\n\nImmediately after Korea’s liberation in 1945, the Korean Methodist Church was torn apart by debates over Japan-era collaboration and theological renewal. The Rebuilding Group (Jaegeonpa), composed of figures like Lee Gyugap and Byun Honggyu, denounced the complicity of Methodist leaders who had engaged in Shinto shrine worship during the colonial period. In December 1945, they declared the reestablishment of the \"Methodist Church of Korea\" and launched separate assemblies and institutions, calling for ecclesiastical purification and the restoration of pre-1939 Methodist traditions.\n\nIn contrast, the Revival Group (Bokheungpa), led by Kang Taehee and others, emphasized revival and growth over reckoning with the past. They argued that the priority should be the church’s spiritual and organizational restoration, not political purging.\n\nThis split resulted in parallel church structures, including rival annual conferences, theological seminaries, and general assemblies. The two sides fought over church properties and authority, often resulting in disruption at the local church level.\n\n\nUnification and the Founding of the Korean Methodist Church\n\nAs tensions escalated, laity groups and American Methodist missionaries, particularly Rev. Jesse W. Jones, mediated reconciliation between the factions. In April 1949, both sides agreed to dissolve their separate structures and form a unified denomination. This union was formalized at the “Unification General Assembly” at Chungdong First Methodist Church, which established the new denomination: “The Korean Methodist Church (KMC)”. Rev. Kim Yusun was elected the first general superintendent. May 1st was declared “Union Sunday,” symbolizing denominational healing. Notably, the Western Annual Conference withheld participation, and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 further hindered reconstruction efforts.\n\n\nPostwar Restructuring and the Rise of Bishop Ryu Hyungki\n\nAfter Kim Yusun was taken to North Korea during the war, Rev. Ryu Hyungki was elected as the new bishop in a 1951 emergency assembly in Busan. A progressive theologian trained in the U.S., Ryu introduced historical-critical methods and held liberal views, including the denial of Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. Following the war, American Methodist missions injected substantial support for reconstruction. Nearly $1 million USD was allocated to rebuild schools, hospitals, orphanages, and churches. As a result, the denomination grew significantly: from around 45,000 members in 1951 to over 120,000 by 1957.\n\n\nA New Division: The Hoheon Group vs. the Ryu Hyungki Faction\n\nDespite postwar growth, internal conflicts resumed. The most notable was the “Mission Fund Incident” (선교불사건), where a failed dollar-based trade investment led to a loss of over $30,000. Critics accused the General Board, led by Bishop Ryu, of secularizing church operations and violating church law. In response, the Hoheon Group, consisting of pastors like Kim Eungtae and Um Jaehee, formed a “Committee for Denominational Rectification” in 1954. In 1955, they established their own annual conference, elected new officers, and launched the “Hoheon Methodist Church” in opposition to what they saw as church corruption and concentration of power. This schism led to serious legal disputes over church properties and violent clashes between opposing congregants in churches such as Chungang and Dongdaemun.\n\n\nDivisions in Other Denominations\n\nHoliness Church (Sungkyul)\n\nThe Holiness Church (Seonggyeol) was divided over its stance toward the World Council of Churches (WCC). One faction supported ecumenism, while another aligned with the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE). These differing theological orientations ultimately led to organizational splits.\n\n\nBaptist Church\n\nThe Korean Baptist Church, receiving support from the Southern Baptist Convention in the U.S., aimed for revitalization but eventually experienced division due to internal disputes over leadership and authority.\n\n\nThe 1950s was a crucible of crisis and transformation for Korean Protestantism. The Methodist Church experienced two waves of division and unification, shaped by debates over Japanese collaboration, theological direction, and denominational leadership. Similar patterns were evident in other denominations. Despite these disruptions, church membership, seminary education, and international mission support all expanded during this time, laying the groundwork for the contemporary Korean church structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPentecostal Movement\n\nThe 1960s marked a pivotal period for the Pentecostal Movement in Korea, as it transitioned from a fringe revivalist impulse to a structured and widely popular religious force. Rooted in the 1906 Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, the Pentecostal emphasis on Spirit baptism and glossolalia (speaking in tongues) entered Korea through American missionary Mary Rumsey in 1928, followed by the establishment of the first Pentecostal church in Seobinggo in 1932. The movement was formally institutionalized with the founding of the Korean Assemblies of God in 1953. A transformative figure in this process was Pastor Yonggi Cho, who, along with Choi Ja-sil, began his ministry in a tent church in 1958. His ministry flourished during the 1960s, culminating in the establishment of Yoido Full Gospel Church, which would later become the world’s largest congregation. As Bae notes, “through glossolalia, divine healing, and exorcism, the Pentecostal leaders delivered messages of hope and healing to a suffering Korean public.”\n\nPastor Cho developed a contextualized theology centered on the “Threefold Blessing” (salvation, prosperity, health) and the “Fivefold Gospel” (salvation, Spirit baptism, healing, blessing, and the Second Coming). This theology emphasized Spirit baptism “not as an internal emotional experience, but as an empowering force for life transformation,” thus distinguishing it from more doctrinal or institutional forms of Protestantism. The spiritual emphasis of the movement found widespread resonance in postwar Korean society, which was recovering from national trauma and grappling with rapid industrialization. As Ryu observes, “Pentecostalism became a channel of healing and recovery for those suffering from physical illness and spiritual exhaustion.” People who were marginalized economically and socially found solace in divine healing, communal prayer, and supernatural experiences like visions and prophecy.\n\nBy the 1970s, Korean Pentecostalism had extended its influence beyond national borders. Pastor Cho gained international attention through publications like Charisma magazine and was identified as one of the most influential charismatic leaders worldwide. According to GOODTV News, “Cho’s work helped ignite the charismatic movement in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.” This global expansion was symbolized by the 1984 International Prayer Conference for World Evangelization, hosted in Seoul. According to Lee, “the spirituality of Korean Pentecostalism—centered on communal prayer and miraculous faith—catalyzed a global youth prayer movement and offered a communal alternative to the individualism of Western Christianity.” Despite its remarkable growth, the movement faced criticism for being overly privatized and materially oriented. “It shifted from an eschatologically grounded, socially engaged revival to an ahistorical movement focused narrowly on individual salvation and prosperity,” observes Ryu Nevertheless, Bae concludes that “the Pentecostal Movement provided a direct spiritual encounter with God through prayer and healing, offering comfort to the masses in times of hardship.”\n\n\nIndigenization Debate in the Korean Church \n\n\nThe indigenization debate in 1960s Korea was not merely a matter of theological semantics, but a critical rethinking of the relationship between the universality of the gospel and the particularity of cultural contexts. This discourse developed in parallel with global theological movements such as the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and the World Council of Churches' emphasis on inculturation. At its core, the debate centered on whether the gospel could be rooted in local cultures, and how Christian theology might engage with indigenous religious and philosophical traditions. It reflected a post-colonial desire among Korean theologians to move beyond transplanted Western missionary theology and toward a theologically autonomous expression grounded in Korean religious sentiments.Yoo Dong-sik: Interpreting the Gospel Through the Lens of Dao\n\nIn his early works “Dao and Logos” (1959) and “The Task of Indigenizing the Gospel in Korea” (1962), Yoo Dong-sik proposed that the Korean mind is more aligned with the Eastern concept of ‘Dao’ than with the Western notion of ‘Logos.’ He argued, “Attempting to interpret the gospel solely through Western concepts obscures its essence,” emphasizing the need to express the gospel in culturally resonant terms.Jun Kyung-yeon: The Gospel as Transcultural Revelation\n\nIn his 1963 essay “Can Christian Culture Be Indigenized?”, Jun countered Yoo’s proposal by arguing that “The gospel is not something that simply takes root in a culture; it is a transcendent revelation.” He criticized Yoo’s approach for compromising “the uniqueness and transcendence of the gospel.”Yoon Sung-beom: Seeking Trinitarian Hints in Dangun Mythology\n\nYoon interpreted Korea’s Dangun mythology as a “Vestigium Trinitatis”—a foreshadowing of the Trinity. He wrote, “The triadic structure of Hwanin, Hwanung, and Hwangeom aligns with the Christian understanding of the Creator, Redeemer, and Perfecter.”Park Bong-rang and Lee Sang-young: Critical Response\n\nPark and Lee strongly opposed Yoon’s interpretation, criticizing it as a form of religious syncretism. Lee in particular asserted, “Dangun mythology is not a precursor to Christian revelation but mere myth; it contains no redemptive truth.”\n\nWhile the debate in theological circles was vibrant, the institutional church showed limited enthusiasm for actual structural reforms. Worship formats, church architecture, and musical styles remained heavily Westernized. Lee Sang-gyu noted, “Korean churches affirmed indigenization in theory but rarely implemented it in worship, education, or liturgical form.” Many Korean Protestants equated Christian faith with ‘Christian culture,’ which they in turn equated with Western civilization. As Lee observed, this tendency “led the church to confuse the gospel with imported Christian customs.” Church buildings adopted Romanesque and Gothic styles, with pulpits and chancels modeled after Western designs. Lee pointed out, “Such structures were more reflective of inculturation than true indigenization.”\n\nDespite institutional hesitance, the indigenization debate marked a turning point. It compelled Korean theologians to reimagine Christianity in cultural terms and laid the foundation for later theological movements such as Minjung theology, liberation theology, and ecological theology. While the church as a whole remained structurally unchanged, this period sparked Korea’s transition from imported to creative theology.\n\n\nTable 9.

It was not merely a technical exercise in textual translation; it was a theologically and politically charged attempt to build a shared linguistic and spiritual ground between Korean Catholics and Protestants. This monumental endeavor carried the aspirations of theological reconciliation, linguistic renewal, and national unity during a period of political unrest and spiritual ferment.\n\nEmerging in the wake of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and the ecumenical momentum initiated by the World Council of Churches, the Korean project gained institutional form through the establishment of the \"성서공동번역위원회\" (Common Bible Translation Committee) in 1968. This committee was a product of mutual openness: the Catholic Church ceased to label Protestant churches as heretical and began referring to them as \"형제 교회\" (brother churches), while Protestant denominations initiated their own efforts toward dialogue. Their shared vision culminated in the publication of the New Testament in 1971 and the complete Bible, including the Old Testament, in 1977.\n\nThis translation work was led by eminent figures from both traditions, including Fr. Seon Jong-wan on the Catholic side and Rev. Moon Ik-hwan from the Protestant side. Moon’s role was especially pivotal. An Old Testament scholar and Hebrew linguist educated at Princeton Theological Seminary, Moon brought both scholarly rigor and poetic sensitivity to the project. He viewed the translation as more than technical labor—it was a mission to restore beauty and clarity to the Korean Bible. He insisted, \"Shedding classical Chinese and Japanese syntax, and being liberated from Western rigid logic, nurturing the pure simplicity of Korean language—that’s the task of the Bible.\" His vision was to see the Bible not only as theology but as literature—capable of transforming worship, preaching, and national identity.\n\nFr. Seon Jong-wan, likewise, brought deep theological insight to the work, and introduced stylistically bold translations. He rejected the rigid rendering of Genesis 1:1—“태초에” (in the beginning)—and instead coined the neologism “비롯음에” (\"at the birthing\") to convey a more dynamic sense of divine creation rooted in Hebrew syntax. Similarly, he translated “빛이 있으라 하시니 빛이 있었더라” (Let there be light, and there was light) as “빛이 생기어라 하시매 빛이 생기니라” (Let light come into being, and it came into being), emphasizing the generative power of the Word. These translations reflected not just linguistic choices but deep theological commitments to a living, breathing God who moves in history.\n\nThese translation choices, however, sparked considerable controversy. One of the fiercest points of contention was the name of God. Catholic translators adhered to “하느님” (Haneunim), a form consistent with traditional Korean Catholic usage. Protestant communities, especially conservative denominations, rejected this in favor of “하나님” (Hananim), which they saw as doctrinally correct and rooted in their worship traditions. The final Common Bible employed “하느님,” which resulted in its rejection by many Protestant churches.\n\nAnother theological flashpoint was the rendering of the Hebrew tetragrammaton YHWH. Catholics introduced “야훼” (Yahweh), aligning closely with Hebrew scholarship. Protestants, however, were more familiar with the older “여호와” (Jehovah), a term inherited from Chinese Protestant Bibles. Once again, the Common Bible’s adoption of “야훼” created discomfort, as it departed from both liturgical and devotional norms among many Protestant communities.\n\nThe controversy extended into Christological and sacramental terminology. Protestants raised concerns that some phrasing in the translation favored Catholic theology—particularly on issues such as the Eucharist, Mary’s role in salvation history, and the nature of grace. Critics argued that the Common Bible leaned too close to Catholic positions on certain doctrinal issues, thus compromising what they saw as necessary theological clarity.\n\nIn terms of translation philosophy, Catholics leaned toward a dynamic equivalence model, seeking to reproduce meaning and affect rather than a word-for-word rendering. Protestants generally favored formal equivalence, seeking fidelity to the original syntax and structure. This difference in hermeneutical posture was vividly seen in how texts like Genesis 1:1 were handled. Moon Ik-hwan passionately believed that scripture should “liberate us from the clunky remnants of classical and colonial language, and bring us into living Korean.” This vision was not universally accepted and indeed was met with resistance from traditions that feared such literary freedom might weaken theological integrity.\n\nDespite—or perhaps because of—these tensions, the Common Bible stands as a unique testimony to what ecumenical cooperation can achieve and where its limits lie. Even its partial rejection speaks volumes about the identities it sought to reconcile. The project was simultaneously a theological union and a catalyst for confessional retrenchment. As one writer observed, “This was the Bible that tried to be both Catholic and Protestant—and in doing so became a symbol of both hope and hesitation.” To further illustrate how the Common Bible addressed these disputed terms, the following table compares key theological expressions and how they were resolved:\n\n\nTable 7. \n\n\n| Disputed Element | Catholic Position | Protestant Position | Final Common Bible Resolution |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| God's Name ('하느님' vs '하나님') | ‘하느님’ (Haneunim) reflects older Korean Catholic usage, emphasizing divine transcendence | ‘하나님’ (Hananim) aligns with Protestant tradition | Used ‘하느님’ throughout, causing some Protestant rejection |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| YHWH / Tetragrammaton | Preferred ‘야훼’ (Yahweh) to restore the original name of God from Hebrew | Preferred ‘여호와’ (Jehovah) as used historically | Adopted ‘야훼’, aligning with Hebrew scholarly conventions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Translation Style | Dynamic equivalence; poetic and natural Korean phrasing | More literal, word-for-word translation | Favored dynamic approach, led by Seon Jong-wan and Moon Ik-hwan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Christological Terms | Emphasized sacramental theology, sometimes including Eucharistic nuances | Preferred language reflecting sola fide theology | Carefully neutralized terms, avoiding overt doctrinal bias |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sacramental Expressions | Use of '성찬례' for Eucharist | Use of '성찬식' for Lord's Supper | Minimized sacramental terms; left to contextual interpretation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mary and Saints | Greater emphasis on Marian passages (Luke 1:28, etc.) | Reserved, non-venerational language | Adopted balanced renderings with literal Greek fidelity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nControversies in the Formation of Minjung Theology\n\n\nA major theological controversy during the formation of minjung theology was the divergence over how to interpret the essence of the Gospel proclamation. In traditional Christian theology, the central framework of the New Testament’s message is known as kerygma, a Greek word meaning “proclamation.” In biblical usage, kerygma refers to the public declaration of the core message of salvation—namely, that Jesus Christ died and rose again, and that those who believe in him will be saved. This concept, rooted in the apostolic preaching of Acts, frames salvation history through the lens of Christ's divine sonship and redemptive death and resurrection. However, minjung theologians strongly critiqued this emphasis on kerygma for abstracting Jesus from his historical context and detaching him from the lived experiences of the oppressed people.\n\nAhn Byung-mu argued that “the theologization of the kerygma transformed the murder of Jesus into a mere death, and replaced his political resistance with religious sacrifice”. For Ahn, the cross should not be understood as a mystical redemptive symbol, but as the result of Jesus’s solidarity with the oppressed and his resistance to unjust power. Thus, the Gospel is not only a message of spiritual salvation but a declaration that demands transformation in the midst of suffering and oppression. While not outright rejecting kerygma, minjung theology contended that “abstract proclamations alone are insufficient without the historical grounding of the people's reality”.\n\nThis approach sparked significant backlash within the Korean church. Conservative Protestant leaders accused minjung theology of “undermining doctrinal orthodoxy and politicizing the Gospel,” labeling it heretical. The controversy intensified when minjung theologians became involved in urban industrial mission work, which led to accusations of communist sympathies. Figures such as Ahn Byung-mu and Suh Nam-dong were even subject to disciplinary actions, including exclusion from theological faculties and threats of excommunication. These events demonstrate that minjung theology was not merely a theological discourse, but a profound confrontation with institutional religion, political authority, and the very meaning of faith.\n\nThe question of whether minjung theology prioritized political resistance over divine communion led to another persistent critique: the supposed absence of spirituality. Critics charged that minjung theology was overly preoccupied with structural injustice and lacked inner piety or mystical depth. In response, theologian Ryu Jang-hyun argued that minjung theology did not arise from monasteries but from “the bodily spirituality experienced in sites of suffering,” which he defined as a “spiritual encounter with God in the context of praxis”. He claimed, “the work of the Holy Spirit is always manifested through the event of the liberation of the minjung”—thus framing liberation not merely as a political event, but as a pneumatological act of salvation.\n\nEven within the movement, internal critiques emerged. One unresolved issue was the ambiguity of the term minjung itself. Who exactly qualifies as the minjung? Are intellectuals part of the minjung? These questions revealed a tension between theoretical constructs and lived realities. Some social theorists criticized the movement’s tendency to “abstract and objectify the people,” suggesting that minjung were often spoken about, but rarely empowered to speak for themselves.\n\nAnother major controversy emerged when Kim Chi-ha—once a central literary and intellectual figure in the minjung movement—shifted toward a life-centered cosmology in the 1980s. Influenced by Tonghak thought and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Kim proposed a cosmic spirituality that redefined minjung through an ecological and universal lens. This move was sharply criticized by progressives, some of whom accused him of “betraying the minjung cause.” Cultural critic Cho Jeong-hwan, however, argued that Kim's life philosophy was “not a withdrawal from history but a proposal for a new ethical paradigm”. While acknowledging\n\nKim’s contradictions, Cho asserted that his cosmic vision could still serve as “an alternative ethics of the universe that seeks to transcend materialist leftist paradigms”. These complex and often painful debates show that minjung theology emerged not only from theological speculation but from concrete historical experiences. It challenged theological, political, and cultural institutions, and in doing so, redefined the mission of theology as public, contextual, and embodied in the life of the people.\n\n\nPneumatological Conflicts and the Rise of the Yoido Full Gospel Church\n\n\nThe debates surrounding pneumatology and charismatic theology that unfolded across the 1970s and 1980s in South Korea were far more than theological disagreements or denominational distinctions. At the center of the storm stood Pastor David Yonggi Cho and the Yoido Full Gospel Church, whose Pentecostal pneumatology offered an experiential and empowering alternative to the traditional doctrines of mainline denominations. By presenting Spirit baptism as a post-conversion event and identifying glossolalia (speaking in tongues) as its clear, external sign, Cho’s theology stood in stark contrast to the Reformed traditions of Korean Presbyterianism, which understood Spirit baptism as synonymous with regeneration and denied the continuation of apostolic gifts such as healing and prophecy.\n\nAs one scholar notes, “Yonggi Cho’s conviction about a Spirit baptism that is distinct from conversion and evidenced by speaking in tongues starkly diverged from the pneumatology of existing denominations.” This theological divergence was not merely a matter of doctrine but was perceived by the theological establishment as a threat to the ecclesial identity and doctrinal orthodoxy of the Korean Protestant church. Figures like Dr. Hyung-Ryong Park of the Presbyterian General Assembly Seminary led the charge in journals such as Shinhak Jinan, critiquing Cho’s theology as unbiblical and misleading.\n\nThe widespread acceptance of Cho’s pneumatology, however, cannot be explained without reference to the socioeconomic upheavals of South Korea during this period. As rapid urbanization, industrialization, rural displacement, and political repression destabilized the social order, Cho’s message of Spirit-empowered healing, blessing, and personal transformation met the existential needs of the Korean people. The practice of speaking in tongues was not merely a doctrinal sign but a form of catharsis and spiritual empowerment for those living at the margins. “The practices of prayer mountain retreats, fasting, healing services, and exorcisms were deeply resonant with the religious sentiment of the Korean masses, and tongues functioned as a sacred language of grace.”\n\nThis theological and practical resonance resulted in explosive church growth. Within just a few decades, the Yoido Full Gospel Church became not only the largest church in Korea but also the largest church in the world. Testimonies of Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues flooded the pages of Shinangye (The Gospel World), a magazine closely associated with the movement. Stories like “I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues within five days” became a recurring feature. However, as criticism mounted, particularly in the 1970s, such testimonies gave way to more theological articles on the benefits and meaning of tongues by theologians like Park Jung-geun.\n\nIn response to criticism, Cho clarified that “speaking in tongues is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit itself... it is rather a powerful external sign of Spirit-filled experience, biblically confirmed.” Despite these clarifications, critics accused Cho’s theology of aligning too closely with shamanistic mysticism and prosperity theology. In 1983, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (Tonghap) launched an official investigation into the beliefs and theology of Yonggi Cho and the Yoido Full Gospel Church, questioning his emphasis on tongues, healing, and spiritual experiences.\n\nDespite criticisms, Cho’s pneumatology proved effective in addressing the psychological and social needs of South Koreans during a time of massive upheaval. The theology of Spirit baptism, charismatic gifts, and divine blessing did not merely promise eschatological salvation but offered tangible transformation in the here and now. His ability to ritualize these experiences in structured church life—through home cell groups, healing services, and prayer mountains—enabled the church to function as both spiritual sanctuary and psychosocial support network. In this sense, “Pentecostalism functioned as practical religion and psychosocial support.”\n\n\nTable 8.

This issue was not merely about ecclesiastical policy but about biblical interpretation, theological identity, and how the Korean church would engage with both its Reformed tradition and the global Christian community. The contrasting responses of Tonghap and Hapdong—two major branches of Korean Presbyterianism formed after the 1959 schism—offered a vivid picture of the growing divergence between progressive and conservative currents within Korean Protestantism.\n\n\nTonghap and Hapdong: Distinct Ecclesial Orientations\n\nTo fully understand their differing positions on women’s ordination, it is crucial to examine the broader theological and institutional orientations of the Tonghap and Hapdong denominations. While both emerged from a shared Presbyterian heritage and adhere to the Westminster Confession of Faith, their trajectories since division have diverged dramatically.\n\n\nTonghap: Ecumenical, Theologically Progressive, and Globally Engaged\n\nTonghap (The Presbyterian Church of Korea) represents the more ecumenical and theologically progressive wing of Korean Presbyterianism. Actively engaged in the World Council of Churches (WCC), Tonghap aligns itself with mainline Protestant denominations worldwide and has shown receptiveness to contemporary theological currents such as contextual theology, gender equality, and social justice.\n\n\nTonghap emphasizes:\n\nParticipation in global Christian networks and cooperation with denominations such as the PCUSA and GKN.\n\nFlexibility in biblical interpretation, including openness to historical-critical methods.\n\nLay leadership, inclusive ministry models, and theological reflection that engages cultural change.\n\nIn this environment, the ordination of women was framed not only as a theological decision but as an issue of mission, justice, and ecclesial credibility in the modern world.\n\nHapdong: Confessionalist, Doctrinally Conservative, and Biblically Literalist\n\nBy contrast, Hapdong (The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) stands as the confessionally conservative and doctrinally rigid branch. It affirms biblical inerrancy, maintains a literal reading of Scripture, and adheres to the regulative principle of worship. Hapdong has been deeply critical of the WCC and other ecumenical organizations, which it views as compromising Reformed orthodoxy.\n\nHapdong’s identity is marked by:\n\nStrict observance of the Westminster standards in unaltered form.\n\nDeep concern for maintaining the gendered hierarchy established in Scripture.\n\nCentralized theological authority and a legacy shaped by theologians such as Park Hyung-Ryong and Seo Chul-Won.\n\nIn this context, the ordination of women was viewed not as a theological innovation but as a threat to the very foundations of church order and biblical authority.\n\n\nHapdong: Confessionalist, Doctrinally Conservative, and Biblically Literalist\n\nBy contrast, Hapdong (The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) stands as the confessionally conservative and doctrinally rigid branch.

Although motions to adopt women elders were repeatedly defeated, the increasing number of affirmative votes revealed a gradual change in denominational sentiment.\n\nKey General Assembly Trends:\n\n58th General Assembly (1973): Motion rejected (95 in favor, 162 opposed).\n\n59th Assembly (1974): Rejected (120:183).\n\n60th Assembly (1975): Rejected (126:180).\n\n61st Assembly (1976): Rejected (133:173).\n\n62nd Assembly (1977): Narrowly rejected (143:157).\n\nThe consistent increase in support indicated a theological and generational shift underway within the denomination\n\nCore Arguments in the Motions:\n\n“Over two-thirds of the church membership consists of women. Their inclusion in ordained ministry is essential for mission effectiveness.”\n\n“Women’s ordination reflects the current global trend of gender equality. The church cannot be seen as ignoring women’s rights.”\n\n“As global partner churches allow women’s ordination, our women are disadvantaged in international ecumenical relations.”\n\nThese arguments were largely contextual and missional, grounded in concerns over justice, parity, and the church’s public witness.\n\n\nHapdong: Rejection Rooted in Scripture and Ecclesial Tradition\n\nHapdong, meanwhile, never formally entertained motions for women’s ordination. Instead, theological treatises and institutional publications served as the primary mode of opposition. By the mid-1990s, the denomination had consolidated its position through articles in Shinhak Jinam (1996, 1997) and the 83rd General Assembly (1998), which officially reaffirmed the prohibition[5†source].\n\nScriptural Grounds for Opposition:\n\n1 Timothy 2:11–15 – “Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.” Interpreted as forbidding women from teaching or exercising authority in the church.\n\n1 Corinthians 11:2–10 – The headship order of creation.\n\n1 Corinthians 14:34–35 – “Women should remain silent in the churches.”\n\n1 Timothy 3:1–7 / Titus 1:5–6 – Qualifications for elders described in male-exclusive terms.\n\nPark Hyung-Ryong maintained:\n\n“The legal authority to teach and rule the entire church belongs exclusively to men; this is the clear meaning of Scripture and the long-held conviction of the universal church.”\n\nWayne Grudem added:\n\n“The New Testament only records the ordination of men, which reflects the divine principle that public church office is given to males alone.”\n\nThis complementarian theology stood at the core of Hapdong's ecclesial structure and identity.\n\n\nTable 9.

It uncovers fundamentally divergent theological ecosystems: Tonghap's global, contextual, and mission-driven orientation versus Hapdong’s confessionalist, biblicist, and ecclesially protective posture. For Tonghap, the issue evolved from inclusion to transformation. For Hapdong, it was always about preservation—of Scripture, order, and tradition. In the end, women’s ordination became a litmus test for each denomination’s identity: a marker of their theological vision, cultural openness, and interpretive method. These tensions, born in the 1970s, continue to define the contours of Korean Presbyterianism to this day.\n\n\nIndigenization Theology and Theological Conflict\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a transitional era in Korean theology, as indigenization theology shifted from theological experimentation to a theology rooted in social engagement. During this period, Korean theologians moved beyond merely adapting the gospel to Korean culture and began reconstructing theology within the lived realities of the Korean people and their history. In this process, fierce theological debates unfolded over how to redefine the relationships among gospel, church, and culture.\n\nThis theological transformation was grounded in concerns raised in the 1960s. In 1959, Yoo Dong-sik published the article “Tao and Logos”, where he asserted that “the gospel must be transmitted through culture and language, and must be reinterpreted through Korean philosophical consciousness”. Similarly, Yoon Sung-bum explored how Christian truth could take root within the spiritual and philosophical frameworks of the Korean people.\n\nWhile these early efforts remained limited to individual scholarly attempts, the 1970s witnessed their expansion into a broader theological movement. The progressive camp—represented by NCCK, KSCF, and Hanshin University—advocated for a theology that resonated with the lived experiences and emotional sensibilities of the Korean people. Theologians such as Suh Nam-dong, Ahn Byung-mu, and Kim Yong-bok argued that indigenization theology must not merely localize the gospel but must incorporate the historical suffering and liberation of the Korean minjung (masses) as its core. Kim Yong-bok defined this as “a theology lived out with the minjung,” emphasizing that “the gospel must be expressed anew through the language and emotions of the people”.\n\nIn contrast, conservative theologians emphasized the transculturality of the Bible, warning that indigenization efforts could undermine the essential nature of Christianity. They maintained that the gospel represents a universally valid truth that transcends all cultures and historical contexts. Consequently, any attempt to integrate elements from Korean traditional religions or indigenous symbols was viewed as a potential threat of syncretism.\n\nThe debates were not confined to abstract theory but were reflected in liturgical practice and theological education. Some seminaries—including Seoul Presbyterian Seminary, Methodist Theological Seminary, and Hanshin University—experimented with Koreanized worship services, incorporating traditional elements such as hanbok attire, pansori preaching, folk hymnody, and even symbolic figures like Dangun or shamanistic imagery. These experiments sparked controversy, with some denominational authorities denouncing them as heretical acts.\n\nMeanwhile, institutional and academic support for indigenization theology was expanding rapidly. The establishment of the Christian Institute for the Study of Korean Culture in 1973 and the Korea Theological Study Institute in 1977 provided structural and scholarly foundations for the movement. Kim Yong-bok’s book The Minjung and Indigenization Theology (1980) articulated the movement’s central direction. He declared, “Indigenization theology is not about surrendering to tradition, but about revitalizing the gospel,” and insisted that theology grounded in solidarity with the minjung represented the authentic path for Korean Christianity.\n\nThis momentum in the 1970s paved the way for further developments in the 1980s, where indigenization theology evolved into a fully institutionalized and practice-oriented minjung theology. Ahn Byung-mu defined minjung theology as “a theology where the Korean church encounters the minjung, based on the recognition that Jesus himself was part of the minjung,” asserting that gospel indigenization must begin from the concrete realities of the oppressed. During the 1980s, indigenization was no longer about translating Christian concepts into Korean symbols, but rather became a theology of liberation addressing the structures of political oppression and economic injustice.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1970s served as a theological bridge between the philosophical inquiries of the 1960s and the praxis-based theology of the 1980s. It was a pivotal decade in which nationalism, faith, liberation, and gospel converged in complex ways. In the broader arc of Korean theological history, the movement for indigenization expanded far beyond questions of “Koreanization” to encompass a full-scale reinterpretation and rearticulation of the Christian gospel within its Korean context.\n\n\nRevisiting the Korean Christian Federation’s Alleged Application to the World Council of Churches: Myth, Miscommunication, and Cold War Echoes in South Korean Protestantism\n\n\nThe issue of the Korean Christian Federation's (KCF) application for membership in the World Council of Churches (WCC) is a symbolic episode that reveals how religious exchanges can acquire political overtones in the Cold War context between North and South Korea. The reality of the event and the reaction of the South Korean Christian community unfolded amid longstanding distortions and misunderstandings, the truth of which has only recently come to light through scholarly inquiry.\n\nThe incident began in February 1974 when two diplomats from the North Korean mission in Geneva visited the WCC headquarters and delivered two letters under the name of the KCF. These letters, rather than expressing a desire to join the WCC, called for the Council’s support of the South Korean church’s pro-democracy movement and condemned the human rights abuses of the Park Chung-hee regime. In particular, the letter stated, \"We hope you will deeply understand our letter and raise your voice against the fascist atrocities committed by the South Korean authorities, and just as you supported our people's struggle for national reunification in the past, we hope you will actively support the righteous struggle of the people, including South Korean religious believers\"—demonstrating that the letter was far more political than religious in nature.\n\nAt the time, this letter was widely misinterpreted as a formal application for WCC membership. Two factors contributed to this misunderstanding. First, one of the North Korean diplomats reportedly said, \"I am not a Christian, but I want to join the WCC,\" requesting information about the organization. Second, South Korean church leaders—such as Rev. Yoo Ho-joon of the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) and Rev. Kim Kwan-seok, General Secretary of the National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC)—relayed this information imprecisely to domestic religious and media circles. Rev. Kim Kwan-seok even held a press conference upon his return, claiming, \"The North fabricated a Christian organization called the Korean Christian Federation that doesn't even exist and tried to apply for WCC membership, but was rejected\". This statement stoked strong opposition within the South Korean Christian community and quickly established the WCC application claim as a fact.\n\nHowever, subsequent archival research by Professor Kim Heung-soo of Mokwon University has clearly shown otherwise. After meticulously examining the WCC archives, he concluded, “It was not a membership application, but a letter requesting WCC support for the pro-democracy movement in South Korea.” Kim noted that he searched the WCC’s underground vaults for this so-called application form but never found it. Instead, the evidence indicated that the North Korean diplomats had simply taken documents like the WCC’s charter, lists of member churches and publications—materials more indicative of information gathering than of any formal application. In short, there was no written application, and the oral comment was grossly exaggerated and miscommunicated as a full-fledged attempt at WCC membership.\n\nThis misunderstanding sparked significant controversy within the South Korean Christian community. The WCC had already been regarded with suspicion by certain conservative Protestant groups in Korea, who viewed it as a pro-communist organization. This perception stemmed from events during the Korean War, when the WCC supported a ceasefire, earning the ire of then-President Syngman Rhee and fueling conspiracy theories promoted by right-wing Christian circles aligned with the American ICCC (International Council of Christian Churches). The claim that the WCC had accepted a membership bid from North Korea further intensified this animosity, and the misbelief persisted well into the 1990s.\n\nEventually, the truth was clarified through academic research: there was no actual application. Instead, the KCF's contact with the WCC was politically motivated, aimed at denouncing South Korea's dictatorship, and was misrepresented due to the tense atmosphere of the Cold War and ideological divides. Professor Kim summarized the matter unequivocally: \"The claim that the KCF applied for WCC membership is historically false.\"*⁷\n\nThis episode carries dual significance for the South Korean church. First, it serves as a case study of how truth can be distorted and weaponized when religious and political interpretations collide. Second, it highlights how misunderstandings about the WCC have hindered South Korea's engagement in global ecumenical movements. As Professor Kim stated, *“The Cold War mentality and narrow theology of the Korean church have produced a distorted view of the WCC.” His findings underscore the need for a more reflective and informed approach to religious diplomacy and church history.\n\nTheological and Political Fault Lines in Minjung Theology\n\n\nMinjung theology emerged in the 1970s as a contextual liberation theology rooted in the suffering and resistance of Korea’s working class and marginalized populations. Deeply influenced by both Latin American liberation theology and Korea’s turbulent democratization process, it offered a theological alternative to both Western dogmatism and politically conservative Korean churches. However, the 1980s marked a critical turning point—not only because of the theological sophistication of Minjung thinkers, but also due to intensified internal tensions and external criticisms. Three core controversies that defined Minjung theology in the 1980s are: its confrontation with conservative Christian orthodoxy, internal disagreements over the identity and role of the Minjung, and feminist critiques that exposed its gendered limitations. These debates did not signal the end of Minjung theology but rather enabled its renewal and transformation into a broader theological discourse of justice, solidarity, and intersectionality.\n\n\nHeresy or Prophecy? Conflict with Conservative Churches\n\nOne of the most persistent challenges facing Minjung theology in the 1980s was the accusation of heresy. Conservative Protestant denominations such as the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Hapdong) and the Kosin Church viewed Minjung theology not as an indigenous theological movement but as an ideological threat contaminated by Marxism and influenced by Latin American radicalism. Theologians like Ahn Byung-mu and Suh Nam-dong were often denied teaching platforms, and church publications warned believers against “pro-North Korean theology.” One pastor famously stated, “Minjung theology does not teach faith in Christ—it seeks to replace Christ with the Minjung as redeemer.”\n\nThe heart of the conflict lay in biblical hermeneutics. Minjung theologians interpreted Scripture through the lens of lived suffering and collective resistance. Ahn’s reading of the ochlos in the Gospel of Mark redefined the crowd not as a passive mob but as active historical agents who stood with Jesus against the religious elite. For conservatives committed to scriptural literalism and theological orthodoxy, this was a dangerous politicization of the gospel. Craig L. Mulling characterizes this conflict as a “discursive battle between orthodoxy and heterodoxy.” He writes, “Minjung theology used the language of liberation to justify moral purification through resistance, while conservative theology used the language of orthodoxy to sanctify state violence and developmental authoritarianism.” This clash reached its peak when the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)—a body supportive of Minjung theology—issued the 1988 “Declaration on the Peaceful Reunification of the Korean People.” The declaration called division a sin and proclaimed that Christians had a moral duty to support reunification efforts.\n\nThe backlash was immediate. Conservative leaders claimed the NCCK was legitimizing the North Korean regime and betraying national security. In response, they established the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) in 1989 as an alternative ecumenical body, explicitly rejecting NCCK’s “pro-communist” theology. The two councils embodied not only different theological frameworks but divergent political theologies: the NCCK emphasized justice and reconciliation, while the CCK advocated gospel-centered reunification through evangelization of the North.\n\n\nFragmentation Within: Competing Definitions of the Minjung\n\nWhile external critics condemned Minjung theology as political heresy, internal tensions were also mounting—especially over the definition of the “Minjung.” Although the term literally means “the people,” its theological content varied widely. Ahn Byung-mu viewed the Minjung as historical agents of resistance, symbolized by the ochlos, who confronted structural injustice alongside Jesus. Suh Nam-dong, by contrast, emphasized the existential suffering of the Minjung as those who bore han—a deep, unresolved pain rooted in oppression and historical trauma.\n\nYi Sam-yeol sought to move beyond both symbolic resistance and existential pathos by positioning the Minjung within civil society. He proposed that Minjung theology evolve into a “public theology” aligned with democratic institutions. “The Minjung,” he wrote, “must now appear not only in resistance but also as citizens asserting their dignity within institutions.”\n\nThese divergent interpretations raised theological questions about whether Minjung theology could maintain coherence without a shared anthropology. Hwang Yong-yeon’s later writings reflected this tension when he argued that “the Minjung are no longer a people—they are a position revealed in suffering”. Such conceptual shifts forced the movement to grapple with questions of historical subjectivity, symbolic representation, and theological boundaries.\n\n\nFeminist Interventions: Gender Blindness and Theological Renewal\n\nThe most piercing critique of Minjung theology in the 1980s came from feminist theologians, who challenged the movement’s male-dominated structure and theological framework. Chun Hyung-Kyung captured the essence of this critique when she declared, “Women are the Minjung within the Minjung. Under the name of the people, women have again been silenced.”\n\nFeminist critiques highlighted the way Minjung theology prioritized the experience of male industrial workers, while neglecting domestic laborers, rural women, and victims of state-sanctioned sexual violence. For Chun, Minjung theology replicated patriarchal patterns under the guise of liberation. Park Soon-Kyung extended this critique through a theological lens. As a key architect of reunification theology, she insisted that national reconciliation must be grounded in maternal spirituality and women’s experiences of caregiving and embodiment. “Women’s theology is the spiritual foundation of reunification,” she wrote, “and it begins in God’s maternal image.”\n\nThese feminist interventions expanded Minjung theology beyond class-based oppression, pushing it to confront the intersectionality of gender, violence, and the symbolic language of salvation. This opened space for what would later become feminist Minjung theology—a discourse centered not on resistance alone, but on healing, memory, and relational ethics.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Minjung theology stood at a crossroads. Externally, it was condemned as heretical and politically subversive; internally, it struggled with competing definitions of its core terms and growing critiques from feminist and regional voices. Yet these very debates were what transformed Minjung theology from a doctrinal movement into a living discourse. Rather than signaling fragmentation or decline, the controversies of the 1980s enabled Minjung theology to undergo a necessary metamorphosis. Through theological debate, ecclesial resistance, and the inclusion of new voices, it evolved into a multi-vocal theology of justice and intersectional solidarity. In so doing, Minjung theology remained faithful to its original task: to interpret the gospel from the underside of history.\n\n\nTheology from Women’s Perspective \n\n\nThe 1980s in South Korea was a time when the streets echoed with cries for democratization, and within churches, the long-silenced voices of women began to emerge. In this climate, feminist theology did not merely seek to argue for women’s rights within the church; it sought to radically reframe theological language, structures, and the very imagination of God. What began as questions within the church matured into a full-fledged theological movement—one that aimed to upend the theological paradigm itself. This movement originated from a challenge to the language structure of the Korean church, where women's silence had long been normalized. Feminist theologians pointed out that the male-centered language of the church—particularly addressing God solely as “Father”—contributed to the erasure of women’s experience and existence. Jung Hyun-sook stated, “Is God male? The Bible doesn’t say so, but that’s what we believe. And that belief has structurally deleted the presence of women”.\n\nThese claims drew sharp criticism from conservative theologians. A theology chair from a major conservative denomination publicly condemned the phrase “Mother God” as “radical feminism that destroys the Bible and leans toward heresy.” In response, Kim Eun-hee stated, “We’re not feminizing God—we’re dismantling the patriarchal imagination that insists God must be male”. This debate over language quickly evolved into a larger question: Who has the authority to interpret God? Whose experience is theology allowed to speak of?\n\nAnother critical controversy centered on the ordination of women. Beginning in the mid-1980s, feminist theologians launched theological and institutional efforts to secure the legitimacy of women's ordination. However, most denominations either flatly rejected or tactically avoided the issue. Jung Mi-hyun declared at a seminar, “A woman’s calling is not granted by the church—it is given by God. And the church has closed its ears to that call”. These discussions were not adequately described by the term “church feminism.” Rather, they possessed a subversive theological character. During this time, feminist theology deepened its engagement with Minjung theology. While Minjung theology spoke of “the God of the oppressed,” feminist theologians pointed out that the image of the oppressed was overwhelmingly male. Kim Eun-hee asked, “Is the woman dying in the kitchen not a Minjung? Is a woman who sells her body for her family, only to be condemned for it, not today’s oppressed?” Thus, feminist theology both embraced and critiqued Minjung theology—sharing its structural analysis of oppression while confronting its gender exclusion. It became clear that feminist theology was not simply a supplement to existing theology; it sought to re-center theological discourse itself.\n\nIn 1987, several attempts were made to formally introduce feminist theology courses at institutions such as Methodist Theological University, Ewha Womans University’s School of Theology, and Hanshin University. These efforts were met with fierce resistance. Some professors and conservative denominational figures claimed such teachings would “ideologize theological education”. One professor at MTU reportedly argued that feminist theology courses would “undermine ecclesiastical order,” and some classes were forced to operate as unofficial seminars. Despite this, students and women’s organizations mobilized to support the courses. A student from one such class said afterward, “For the first time, I felt I was allowed to speak. The church told me to stay silent, but the Bible told me to speak”\n\nAnother wave of opposition came in the form of labeling feminist theology as heretical. Conservative critics argued that it was rooted in “ideological feminism” rather than Christian doctrine, and some public lectures by feminist theologians were cancelled or banned. Jung Hyun-sook responded in a lecture, “We are not abandoning doctrine—we are speaking on behalf of those whom doctrine has abandoned. That is the recovery of the gospel”.\n\nToward the end of the decade, feminist theology expanded into discourses of life, the body, and ecology, challenging anthropocentric salvation doctrines and domination-centered theology. Eco-feminist theology emerged, aiming to build a “life-giving theology.” Kim Young-joo argued, “The Genesis command to ‘subdue and rule over’ has operated as language of oppression for both nature and women. We must begin a theology that listens again to life”.\n\nFinally, the 1980s marked the beginning of international solidarity for Korean feminist theologians. They engaged with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EATWOT), and other global networks to build shared feminist theological discourse. At the 1988 Asian Women Theologians Conference in Manila, the declaration “Patriarchal theology kills our God” was read aloud. Korean theologians were present, connecting Korean feminist theology to a wider global theological movement.\n\nFeminist theological thought in Korea initially emerged through challenges to gender discrimination within the church—calls for voice, presence, and equality. These were often received as internal reforms or seen through the lens of liberal feminism. But as feminist theologians began generating their own theological vocabulary, frameworks, and communities, they moved beyond the boundaries of ecclesiastical critique. They posed radical questions about who theology exists for, how God is imagined, and what it means to speak of salvation from the perspective of the silenced and wounded.\n\nThis marked a paradigm shift from calls for inclusion to the construction of an alternative theological worldview. Feminist theology in Korea did not stop at asking for room in the existing house—it sought to rebuild the house altogether.\n\nFemale Ordination\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the issue of female ordination emerged as a full-fledged institutional controversy in South Korea, with the debate sharply divided between two major Presbyterian denominations: the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK Tonghap) and the General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (PCK Hapdong). This was not merely a dispute over institutional reform but rather a comprehensive reflection of theological identity, biblical interpretation methods, and perspectives on female leadership within the church.\n\nIn 1994, the PCK Tonghap officially approved female ordination at its 79th General Assembly, with 701 votes in favor, 612 against, and 8 abstentions. The following year, the constitutional amendment was finalized through presbytery-level ratification, allowing women to sit for the ordination examination beginning in 1996. That autumn, 19 women became the first officially ordained female ministers within the denomination. This marked the culmination of over sixty years of petitions and deliberations, dating back to the 1933 request for female elders. Meanwhile, the PCK Hapdong strongly opposed the decision. It reaffirmed its opposition to female ordination in its journal Shinhak Jinam in 1996 and 1997 and reiterated this position at its 83rd General Assembly in 1998. Although some limited measures were discussed—such as granting female missionaries temporary sacramental authority or acknowledging calls for female military chaplains—the denomination maintained its rejection of female ministerial ordination.\n\nAt the core of this debate lay a theological clash between egalitarianism and complementarianism. Egalitarians cited Genesis 1:27 (“male and female He created them in the image of God”) and Galatians 3:28 (“there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus”) as central affirmations that women could rightfully exercise leadership in the church. They also called for critical, historical-contextual interpretation of Pauline prohibitions such as 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 and 1 Timothy 2:12. Notably, New Testament scholar Seyoon Kim argued that the passage in 1 Corinthians 14 was a later interpolation and should not be viewed as reflecting Paul’s original stance on women. By contrast, complementarians asserted a divinely ordained distinction between male and female roles, especially in church leadership. Wayne Grudem argued that Scripture consistently prohibits women from holding office as pastors or elders, affirming that “the consistent position of the church throughout history has been to reserve such offices for men.” He viewed this not as a culturally contingent norm, but as rooted in the created order. Korean theologian Park Hyung-ryong similarly maintained that Paul's teachings represented a universal and timeless truth applicable to all churches, not merely to local contexts.\n\nThis clash extended beyond exegesis to deeper theological debates concerning anthropology, ecclesiology, and even divine ontology. Linda Belleville, an advocate of egalitarianism, accused complementarianism of entrenching patriarchal authority structures and reinforcing gender-based hierarchies in the name of tradition. In response, complementarians warned that egalitarianism imported secular ideologies into the church, thereby weakening the authority of Scripture and destabilizing the ordained church order.\n\nThe decision by the PCK Tonghap to ordain women was not confined to internal policy but resonated widely across Korean society. Women’s organizations and progressive media outlets welcomed it as a breakthrough against patriarchal religious structures. Women’s News praised the shift, declaring that “a church without women in ministry is no longer imaginable.”\n\nConservative Christian media and leaders, however, expressed fierce opposition. The Christian Bulletin (Kidosinbo) denounced the decision as “a humanistic move that destroys the order of Scripture,” and some congregations even launched petition campaigns to reverse the change. The PCK Hapdong continued to uphold its complementarian stance, reiterating in 1998 that female evangelists may be honored but not ordained.\n\nWhile this debate initiated institutional reforms, many challenges persisted. Although women could now be ordained in the PCK Tonghap, they faced structural limitations in practice. Very few female pastors secured senior pastor positions or influential roles in presbytery leadership. Theologian Seo Young-im observed that “the number of ordained women increased steadily, but most served in assistant roles or specialized ministries,” and “the male-dominated structure of the church remained deeply entrenched.” In response, women ministers began to form collective networks to address these structural challenges. Organizations such as the Korean Association of Women Pastors and the National Council of Women Ministers emerged to advocate for leadership development, combat discrimination, and enhance public perceptions of female pastors. At the same time, scholars like Jung Mi-hyun, Oh Sung-choon, and Choi Young-shil advanced feminist theological critiques of male-centered ecclesiology and biblical language. The issue also gained international visibility. Global ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Presbyterian Church (USA) highlighted Korea’s ordination reform as a leading case among Asian churches. The PCK Tonghap gained recognition for integrating female leadership into its denominational structure. Nevertheless, many conservative denominations—including the PCK Hapdong and the Kosin Church—continued to reject female ordination on the grounds that ecclesiastical offices must follow the divinely instituted order. This divide has created ongoing theological rifts within Korean Protestantism and continues to impede interdenominational cooperation in areas such as social engagement, ecumenical work, and joint missions.\n\nUltimately, the debate over women’s ordination in 1990s Korea was more than a policy dispute; it was a watershed moment that exposed deep tensions in theology, gender ideology, and institutional power. The conflict between egalitarian and complementarian frameworks continues to shape Korean ecclesial identity and structure to this day.\n\n\nNew Apostolic Reformation (NAR)\n\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the Korean church was confronted with the growing spread of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), prompting strong responses from various conservative denominations and theologians. These disputes were not merely differences in theological interpretation or cultural practice, but rather structural confrontations involving the authority of Scripture, the cessation of divine revelation, the nature of ecclesial polity, and the essence of worship.\n\nNAR advocates claimed that the offices of apostles and prophets should be restored in the modern church and that they must exercise the highest authority over ecclesial leadership. Through apostolic governance and prophetic revelation, they asserted their role in determining the direction of the church, bypassing traditional denominational systems. Moreover, phenomena such as falling, trembling, gold dust, “glory clouds,” and miraculous healings were framed as essential manifestations of God’s presence in worship. These features clashed sharply with the principles of sola scriptura and the cessationist tradition upheld by conservative Reformed theology.\n\nIn 1995, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) passed a resolution to prohibit the introduction of the Vineyard Movement, citing its overemphasis on sensory and mystical experiences that threatened to distort the essence of Christian worship. The Vineyard Movement promoted phenomena such as prophecy, healing, and emotional outbursts (e.g., laughter, crying, falling), which were seen as undermining the traditional liturgical order.\n\nIn 2007, the Kosin General Assembly declared NAR teachings to be “extremely unsound doctrine” and prohibited the reading of related literature, the invitation of NAR-affiliated speakers, and participation in related gatherings. The Kosin denomination saw NAR as promoting extra-biblical revelation, dismantling orthodox theology, and disrupting the established ecclesial order.\n\nIn 2009, the Hapdong denomination officially labeled NAR teachings as heretical and adopted a resolution banning all participation and fellowship. The denomination criticized the NAR for creating a new spiritual hierarchy within the church and undermining the closed canon of Scripture by elevating apostolic and prophetic utterances above biblical authority. In addition to these theological concerns, all three denominations expressed alarm at how the movement's emphasis on autonomous experience and subjective authority bypassed denominational discipline and encouraged division among congregations.\n\nThese responses were not based on surface-level disagreement but stemmed from a deeply rooted conviction that the NAR posed a fundamental threat to the theological identity, liturgical order, and public authority of the Korean church. Even today, the boundaries established during the 1990s continue to serve as critical guardrails in Korean evangelical theology.\n\n\nTable. Summary of Reasons for Prohibiting NAR\n\n\n| Reason for Prohibition | Details |\n| --- | --- |\n| Violation of the Closure of Revelation | Violation of orthodox theology by advocating extra-biblical revelations |\n| --- | --- |\n| Disruption of Church Order | Establishment of authority structures centered on modern apostles and prophets |\n| --- | --- |\n| Abuse of Mystical Phenomena | Emphasis on gold dust, trembling, and non-verbal ecstatic behaviors |\n| --- | --- |\n| Similarity to and Risk of Connection with Heresies | Independent activities outside the church, fostering blind obedience to leaders |\n| --- | --- |\n| Undermining Public Credibility | Weakening of balanced, public Christian witness and practice |\n| --- | --- |\n\n\nConservatism, Liberalism, Progressivism, and Evangelicalism\n\n\nThe 1990s was a pivotal period in Korean Christianity, marked by theological transitions, tensions, and reformulations across conservative, liberal, progressive, and evangelical traditions. Each stream grappled with its own internal crises while engaging in broader debates about church identity, theological integrity, and growth. These interactions generated both innovation and fragmentation in the theological landscape of the Korean church.\n\nConservative theology, particularly represented by denominations such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (PCK, Hapdong and Kosin), sought to maintain the legacy of Reformed orthodoxy rooted in the Westminster Confession. However, facing stagnation in church growth, some conservative theologians initiated a turn toward evangelicalism. This movement, as exemplified by figures like Park Yun-sun, maintained biblical inerrancy while emphasizing gospel-centered preaching. Yet this transition also blurred boundaries with revivalism and pragmatic church-growth ideologies, raising concerns about theological dilution.\n\nLiberal theology, primarily affiliated with the Methodist Church, entered a period of self-criticism. The decline in church vitality and social influence prompted some within the tradition to adopt more evangelical elements or to seek new relevance through practical ministry. However, this shift sparked intense conflict. In some instances, liberal theologians were even expelled from their denominations for perceived doctrinal deviation. While liberal theology had historically emphasized reason, experience, and pluralism, it now faced a credibility crisis amid calls for biblical fidelity and ecclesial renewal.\n\nProgressive theology, as developed by the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (PROK), retained its focus on contextual and socially engaged theology, particularly through the legacy of Minjung Theology. The 1990s witnessed attempts to expand this framework into ecological, cultural, and postcolonial directions. Yet progressive theology also faced diminished mass appeal and internal debates about its political alignment, leading to reflection on how to balance prophetic engagement with ecclesial sustainability.\n\nEvangelical theology became the most influential theological movement of the decade. Emphasizing scriptural authority, personal conversion, and mission, it was adopted across denominational lines. However, in Korea, evangelicalism was increasingly intertwined with pragmatism and prosperity theology. Large churches adopted growth-centered strategies and spiritualized material success, resulting in widespread criticism of the commercialization of faith and the loss of theological depth.\n\n\nTable. Theological Movements in 1990s\n\n| Theological Stream | Key 1990s Trends | Debates and Struggles | Significance and Impact |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservatism | Shift toward evangelicalism | Confusion between fundamentalism and renewal | Emphasis on gospel-centered preaching; need for theological reform |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Liberalism | Decline and partial evangelical adoption | Doctrinal conflicts and expulsions | Recognition of liberal limits; some move toward evangelically grounded praxis |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Progressivism | Expansion of Minjung theology | Crisis of relevance and internal critique | Continued social critique; reduced influence in church growth metrics |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Evangelicalism | Rise and eventual distortion | Prosperity theology and superficiality | Mass appeal with theological shallowness; criticism of commodified Christianity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nExpansion of Christian Heresies\n\n\nThe 1990s marked a dramatic turning point in South Korea’s religious landscape, as numerous Christian heretical movements—most notably JMS, Shincheonji, the Church of God, and the Guwonpa (Salvation Sect)—expanded their reach and visibility. Amidst rapid modernization and social unrest, particularly during the 1997–98 IMF crisis, these groups capitalized on spiritual confusion, dissatisfaction with institutional churches, and eschatological fears to attract vulnerable populations, especially youth and women.\n\nJMS (Jesus Morning Star), led by Jung Myung-seok, emerged from the Unification Church and rapidly expanded in the 1990s through university-based recruiting. Jung’s strategy involved establishing pseudo-student clubs and cultural organizations centered on cheerleading, dance, modeling, and sports to attract elite university students. Despite growing social criticism following the 1999 “Hwangyang Abduction Case” and televised investigative reports, JMS maintained its organizational coherence. It continued to appeal to youth through seemingly harmless activities that concealed its indoctrination process and veneration of Jung as a messianic figure.\n\nShincheonji, founded in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, initiated aggressive expansion strategies in the 1990s through free Bible centers, disguised theological schools, and infiltration of traditional churches. The group implemented a step-by-step recruitment system, beginning with assessing “ignorance,” attacking mainstream churches, gradually teaching Shincheonji doctrine, and finally revealing the true identity of the group. Lee was presented as the only mediator of salvation, and scripture was interpreted allegorically to reinforce exclusivist beliefs. The group employed tactics such as “harvest workers” to sow division within congregations and replace leadership from within.\n\nThe World Mission Society Church of God, formerly known as the Ahn Sahng-Hong Witnesses, also gained prominence during this period. After the failed prophecy of Ahn’s return in 1988, the group continued to promote doomsday messages such as the 1997 and 1999 end-time claims. They emphasized observance of Saturday Sabbath and the Passover, rejected Christmas and Easter as pagan rituals, and revered both Ahn and his spiritual “bride,” Jang Gil-ja, as divine figures. Their proselytization often took the form of door-to-door surveys targeting Christian homes, where doctrinal critiques led to persistent invitations to Bible studies.\n\nThe Guwonpa (Salvation Sect), particularly under Park Ok-soo, posed a distinct challenge due to its claim to affirm biblical authority while deviating significantly from orthodox soteriology. Emphasizing one-time “realization-based” salvation, Park downplayed repentance and ethical transformation, attracting many through the promise of absolute assurance. During the 1990s, this sect actively targeted high school and university students with youth camps and charismatic teaching events, promoting the image of being more spiritually “pure” than mainstream churches.\n\nAdditionally, the infamous 1992 failed prophecy by Dami Mission, which predicted the rapture in October of that year, caused national hysteria and became a turning point in public awareness of end-times heresies. Many groups, including the Church of God and Guwonpa, recycled similar eschatological claims to maintain urgency among followers. The Unification Church, while institutionally stabilized by the 1990s, continued to serve as a doctrinal foundation for derivative groups such as JMS.\n\nThis period also witnessed the failure of traditional churches to adequately respond. Theological illiteracy among laypeople, institutional corruption, and pastoral authoritarianism created fertile ground for sectarian infiltration. Many churches only began confronting the problem after experiencing internal disruption. Consequently, several denominations issued formal heresy declarations only in the mid-1990s, lagging behind the rapid expansion of these groups.\n\nSociologically, Korea’s religious environment—marked by syncretism, Shamanistic tendencies, and pragmatic spiritualism—also contributed to the appeal of heretical movements. Their emotional intensity, prophetic claims, and promises of certainty offered an alternative to bureaucratized and disenchanted institutional religion. For many youth and marginalized individuals, these groups represented not just theological alternatives but communities of belonging and purpose.\n\nIn sum, the 1990s represent a critical era in which Korean Christian heresies grew both in complexity and social impact. Their strategies became increasingly intelligent, their teachings more theologically radical, and their outreach more targeted. This decade laid the foundation for their continued presence in the 21st century and underscored the urgent need for doctrinal education and spiritual discernment within the Korean church.\n\n\n Rapture Prediction Incident in 1992\n\n\nOn October 28, 1992, South Korea witnessed an unprecedented outbreak of rapture hysteria, incited by a fringe Christian movement known as the Mission for the Coming Days (Dami Seonkyohwe). Far beyond a failed prophetic claim, the incident exposed deep theological vulnerabilities in the Korean Protestant landscape. Thousands of families were torn apart, careers and studies abandoned, and the authority of the church undermined. At the center of the movement stood Lee Jang-rim, a self-proclaimed prophet and former lay translator, whose teachings blended dispensational premillennialism, new revelations, and fear-based eschatology to mobilize a nationwide religious fervor.\n\nLee, who dropped out of Methodist Theological Seminary in his first year, had a background in Pentecostal and Holiness movements and spent over a decade working in Christian publishing. Through exposure to American eschatological texts—such as The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey, Raptured by Ernest Angley, and I Saw Heaven by Percy Collet—he formed a uniquely Korean version of rapture theology, which eventually coalesced into a specific date: October 28, 1992 . Lee claimed this date was confirmed through the visions of a high school student named “Jingun,” who allegedly received prophetic dreams.\n\nThe intensity of belief surrounding this date reached extreme proportions. Followers, estimated at around 20,000, sold their homes, quit jobs, severed family ties, and relocated to communes to prepare for the rapture. Some believers testified to seeing supernatural signs—pillars of fire and clouds—on the predicted date. Many claimed spiritual experiences and visions during collective worship sessions in the weeks leading up to October 28. These phenomena, which psychologists later interpreted as mass hallucination and group hypnosis, were cited by followers as divine confirmation.\n\nWhen October 28 passed uneventfully, the aftermath was catastrophic. Only about 5% of the followers returned to their previous churches, while up to 60% became disillusioned, suffered mental health breakdowns, or turned to atheism. Entire families had collapsed. Young adults abandoned studies and careers. Church communities, caught unprepared, responded poorly. Most churches failed to embrace those who returned, often viewing them as spiritually compromised. For many, the disappointment transitioned into a deep distrust of institutional religion.\n\nEven more concerning, a number of leaders involved in the 1992 prediction disappeared for a time and later resurfaced under new names, launching alternative cult movements with slightly modified doctrines. Experts at the time warned that once someone was fully absorbed by false revelations, recovery was unlikely, and relapse into new cultic ideologies was common.\n\nThe institutional church’s response was slow and fragmented. While some denominations—such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Tonghap and Hapdong branches)—issued formal heresy declarations against Lee Jang-rim by 1991, most pastors and congregations initially dismissed the movement as fringe. This allowed the message to spread relatively unchecked. After the failure of the prophecy, many in the church realized that they had neglected theological instruction and discernment training within their congregations.\n\nIn a detailed postmortem, Professor Park Yong-gyu outlined several key factors contributing to the disaster. First was the collapse of doctrinal education. Korean churches had drifted away from systematic theology, including instruction on salvation, revelation, and eschatology. Second, there was confusion between spiritual inspiration and revelation. Many believers misinterpreted dreams, emotions, or intuition as divine prophecy. Third, supernatural experience had displaced biblical authority. Visions, speaking in tongues, and ecstatic encounters were mistakenly elevated as normative faith experiences.\n\nPark also emphasized that Korean churches failed to teach that the date of Christ’s return is unknowable. While Lee’s followers cited verses like John 16:13 (“He will tell you what is yet to come”), they ignored Matthew 24:36, where Jesus clearly states that “no one knows the day or hour.” Misreading such passages allowed Lee to claim divine insight into the rapture date, despite scripture's explicit warning. Furthermore, there was almost no theological emphasis on the Trinity, or a robust doctrine of biblical sufficiency. Lee’s followers believed that salvation was attainable through “merit”—not by grace through faith—but by participating in communal rapture training and offering financial support .\n\nFinally, the rapture panic exposed the widespread emotionalism and mysticism in Korean Protestantism. Faith became increasingly grounded in ecstatic experience, not in Scripture. Dreams, visions, and private revelations were treated as trustworthy guides, often surpassing the Bible itself in authority. The 1992 incident showed that in the absence of careful theological instruction, even well-meaning Christians could be swept into heresy.\n\nIn retrospect, the Dami movement’s failure was not simply a false prophecy; it was a mirror reflecting the spiritual and theological immaturity of the Korean church. The legacy of 1992 continues in various forms today—whether through charismatic leaders claiming new revelations, “prophetic ministries” on YouTube, or fringe apocalyptic cults. The year 1992 was not the end of the world—but in many ways, it was judgment day for Korean Protestantism.\n\n\n\n(1) The Term Question (Li Shichang 2008: 1-20; Xing Fuzeng 1995: 98-107)  \n\n\nSince Christianity was introduced to China, missionaries debated how to translate the Hebrew word Elohim and the Greek Theos in the Bible. Two main schools of thought emerged: one advocated for the term \"神\" (Shen), while the other preferred \"上帝\" (Shangdi). From 1877 to 1878, a debate known as the \"Term Question\" unfolded, with significant contributions from Chinese Christians, including participants from Hong Kong.  \n\n\nThe debate was sparked by an article, On the Term Question, by Shanghai missionary Huang Pin-san, published in The Chinese Recorder. J. S. Roberts, an American Presbyterian missionary and editor of the publication, responded with his own commentary, inviting readers to share their opinions. Over 60 articles were subsequently published, most written by Chinese pastors or believers. Among the contributors were Hong Kong believers Ho Yuk-chuen (LMS) and Kwong Yat-sau (LMS).  \n\n\nHo Yuk-chuen, a Confucian scholar who converted to Christianity at 51 and was baptized by James Legge in 1857, was a prominent participant. In his article Harmonizing the Way of Heaven, Ho argued that the Christian \"Way of Shangdi\" aligns with the Confucian \"Way of Shangdi\" found in the Six Classics. Ho’s views drew criticism from Roberts, who asserted that Christianity represented the \"Way of Heaven,\" distinct from Confucianism’s \"Way of Humanity.\" Ho countered in a follow-up article, insisting that the two were compatible and accusing Roberts of obstructing the Gospel's spread in China with his rigid views.  \n\n\nKwong Yat-sau, who worked as a missionary after converting in Sydney, wrote An Examination of the Term Question. He emphasized that \"帝\" (Di) in Confucian texts means \"ruler\" or \"honored one,\" making \"上帝\" an appropriate translation for Elohim and Theos. He argued that even in China, a land of idol worship, there existed an understanding of the Heavenly Father, making \"上帝\" a fitting choice.  \n\n\nOthers involved in the debate included Wong Yuk Cho and Wong Chin Yu, sons of Wong Yuen Sum, though they were then serving in Guangdong and began their work in Hong Kong churches later in the 1880s. All these figures supported the use of \"上帝,\" though their arguments reflected different influences, with Ho’s rooted in Confucian scholarship.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(2) Can Christians Practice Ancestral Worship? (Xing Fuzeng 1995: 107-117; Xing Fuzeng & Leung Ka-lun 1997)  \n\n\nThe issue of ancestral worship has been a persistent challenge in the interaction between Christianity and Chinese culture. This debate occurred among both missionaries and Chinese believers in the Ming-Qing Catholic missions and the late Qing Protestant missions. Even in British-ruled Hong Kong during the 19th century, the question of whether Christians could practice ancestral worship was raised.  \n\n\nIn 1883, Guangdong Confucian scholar Luo Funan published An Inquiry into Correcting Misunderstandings in The Chinese Recorder. Luo expressed admiration for Christianity but refrained from converting due to its prohibition of ancestral worship. He argued that ancestral worship represented respect for parents, adherence to laws, and the preservation of propriety, rather than idolatry or superstition. This article sparked widespread discussion, leading to the compilation of A Collection of Clarifications in 1884 by the Presbyterian missionary Du Dingyu, featuring responses to Luo’s arguments.  \n\n\nHong Kong Christians also joined the debate. Ho Yuk-chuen, despite his Confucian background and efforts to reconcile Confucianism with Christianity, condemned contemporary ancestral rites as corrupted by Buddhist and Taoist practices. Wong Yuk Cho, from the LMS, distinguished between the \"original meaning\" of ancestral rites—an expression of filial piety—and their \"corrupted meaning,\" which involved idolatrous practices. Wong argued that true worship lies in heartfelt remembrance rather than physical rituals.  \n\n\nBoth Ho and Wong acknowledged the Confucian ideals behind ancestral worship but viewed contemporary practices as deviations. They emphasized that Christians, while rejecting ritualistic worship, upheld filial piety. Nevertheless, the mainstream missionary stance in the late Qing period remained firmly against ancestral worship, making it a highly contentious issue.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n(3) A Study of the Holy Path's Arrival in the East (1899) (Li Zhigang 2013)  \n\n\nA Study of the Holy Path's Arrival in the East was the first systematic historical account of Christianity’s spread to China, written by Wong Yuen Sum, an early Rhenish Mission evangelist. Wong completed the book in 1899, with its preface dated May 1899.  \n\n\nThe book consists of 38 pages and 14 chapters, including:  \n\n- The Arrival of Nestorianism  \n\n- The London Missionary Society in Guangdong  \n\n- The Baptist Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- The American Congregational Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- The Anglican Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- The American Presbyterian Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- The Wesleyan Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- The Fu Han Society in Guangdong  \n\n- The German Rhenish Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- An Appendix on Rev. McMichael and the Rhenish Mission's Church-Building Efforts  \n\n- The Basel Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- The Hong Kong Berlin Foundling House  \n\n- The Little Berlin Mission in Guangdong  \n\n- An Appendix on the Arrival of Catholicism in the East.  \n\n\nThe sections on the Rhenish Mission are the most detailed, reflecting Wong’s personal affiliations. The book stands as the earliest Chinese-written account of various Christian missions in Guangdong.  \n\n\nIn his preface, Wong stated, “Nations have histories, cities have chronicles, clans have genealogies, and families have biographies—all to preserve records for posterity.” He emphasized his firsthand experience of Christianity’s early development in Guangdong, aiming to document its history for future generations.  \n\n\nIn 1906, McMichael wrote a new preface for the book, emphasizing the significance of church history in remembering origins and understanding the sacrifices made by early missionaries. On the centennial of Robert Morrison’s arrival in China, McMichael promoted Wong’s work, highlighting its role in tracing the roots of Christianity in Guangdong and the hardships endured by missionaries.  \n\n(1) 聖號論爭 Term Question（李熾昌2008：1-20；邢福增1995：98-107）\n\n\n自基督教入華，傳教士在聖經漢譯時，就如何翻譯希伯來聖經原文中的「Elohim」及希臘文聖經中的「Theos」出現爭論，主要分為兩派，一派主張譯作「神」，另一派主張譯作「上帝」。1877至1878年間，《萬國公報》展開了一場以華人信徒為主的「聖號」論爭，其中有來自香港信徒的參與。\n\n\n論爭首先由上海教士黃品三的文章〈聖號論〉引起，《萬國公報》主編美國長老會傳教士陸佩（J. S. Roberts）在文末即撰文回應，並呼籲讀者就此表達意見。結果，合共60多篇的文章刊出，大多為各地華人牧者或信徒。其中，來自香港的何玉泉（倫敦會）、鄺日修（倫敦會）也有參與。\n\n\n何玉泉，自幼習儒，至51歲始皈信基督教，並於1857（53歲）由倫敦傳道會理雅各（James Legge）施洗。1863年起任太平堂學校教師，1873年調至下市場堂任宣教師，1881年退休。在〈天道合參〉一文中，何指出聖經中「上帝之道」，正是跟儒家六經「上帝之道」相通。「凡傳上帝之道，在西國則以新舊約所載之上帝為主，在中國則以六經所載之上帝為真」，「欲傳新舊約所言之上帝，則莫如即六經所言之上帝以證之；欲傳耶穌所言之上帝之道，則莫如以孔子所言之上帝之道以明之」。他的主張，引起陸佩的批評，認為基督教與儒家之間，乃「天道」與「人道」之別，並指何的觀點，反映出儒者的「驕心」。何玉泉再撰〈續天道合參〉來回應，再強調儒家也是「天道」的一部分，故「合參」兩者並無不可。他反指陸佩「逞一己之浮詞妄論」，才是福音在華傳播的阻力。陸佩再撰文駁斥何，指除了耶和華外，其他均為「假神」；除了耶穌「天道」外，其他均是「迷路者」。\n\n\n毋庸置疑，何玉泉的觀點，跟倫敦傳道會理雅各十分接近。事實上，理在香港期間，曾任英華書院校長，何玉泉亦曾以「英華書院教友」自稱，並指兩人認識已十多年。理雅各在1877年的在華傳教士會議上，也指新舊約聖經的「上帝」即儒家經典的「上帝」。可以說，何玉泉是香港倫敦會中的理雅各的跟隨者。\n\n\n鄺日修早年遠赴澳洲礦場工作。1868年間在悉梨信主，後任傳道。1874年回國，曾隨同聖公會傳教士於增城、北海等地巡迴佈道。到香港後，鄺向當時聖公會的包爾騰主教（John S. Burdon）陳述心志，乃進入聖保羅書院神道班學道。當時香港倫敦會因缺乏華人傳道，適逢鄺氏畢業，乃向聖公會商借聘請他為宣教師。在倫敦會任宣教師七年後，鄺日修於1883年加入聖公會任宣教師。1883年7月8日被按立為會吏，是聖公會在港按立的第二位華人聖品人員。在〈聖號論衡〉中，鄺日修解釋儒家經典中「帝」的意思，有「君」「尊」之意，因此，「上帝」代表「總管萬人萬物之主」。中國文化雖為「拜偶像」之「異邦」，但「非不知天父之名」。他認為，儒家組典有關「上帝」的論述，正好是「經父曾與其名於中華」的證據。質言之，以「上帝」作為「阿綠軒」（Elohim）、「地腰司」（Theos）的漢譯，是「順理合經，誠為允當」。\n\n\n除了何玉泉及鄺日修外，王元深的兩名兒子（王煜初及王謙如）也有參與是場論爭。不過，兩人當時仍在廣東禮賢會服事，其在香港教會的服事工作，要到1880年代始先後來港。王煜初任倫敦會道濟會堂，王謙如則任香港禮賢會。\n\n\n何、鄺及雙王人均為「上帝」派的支持者。不過，何玉泉由於具儒生的背景，其立論跟畢業於教會學校的鄺日修（王煜初及王謙如）相比，無疑具有更濃厚的儒家色彩。\n\n\n(2) 奉教信徒可以祭祖嗎？（邢福增1995：107-117；邢福增、梁家麟1997）\n\n\n祭祖問題是基督教與中國相遇歷時中，不能迴避的課題。不論明清天主教或晚清基督教，不管是傳教士內部，或是華人信徒，均就此問題展現激辯與爭論。香港雖是英國殖民地，但在19世紀也曾就「奉教信徒可否祭祖」問題，作出思考。\n\n\n1883年，廣東教外儒生羅黻南撰寫〈指迷弼教論〉，刊於《萬國公報》，表達他對基督教的欣賞，但礙於教會堅持禁祭立場而未能成為信徒。他強調祭祖是敬父母、遵法度、存禮教之表現，絕非迷信或拜偶像之俗。此文引起教內不少討論，後來廣東長老會杜鼎如於1884年編成《釋疑彙編》一書，收集了不同人士對羅氏的回應。\n\n\n在眾多回應中，香港基督徒也參與其中。包括香港自理會何玉泉及香港禮賢會王煜初。何玉泉雖具儒教背景，也致力調和儒學與基督教，但他在祭祖問題上，卻指出現今流行的祭禮，已深受佛道二教影響，「皆邪教異端之所為」。\n\n\n王煜初則從祭祀源流作出回應，指祭有「本義」及「變義」之分，前者乃「展孝思」之「正祭」，但卻已被扭曲成為「享親魂」的「俗祭」。他強調，用心、言、行來祭，才是祭之真理。作為「天教」的基督教，「以尊天而尊親」，比作為「人教」的儒教「以尊親而尊天」為優。\n\n\n可見，何、王兩人其實並肯定儒家祭禮的本義，但卻認為現存祭祖風俗，業已變質。同時，他們也指出，基督徒雖不「祭祖」，但也非不重視孝道倫理。當然，晚清時期基督教傳教士的主流意見仍是禁止祭祖。因此，「祭祖」無疑是個極爭議的課題，香港華人牧者及信徒，在此課題上，基本上沒有偏離主流論述。\n\n\n(3) 《聖道東來考》（1899）（李志剛2013）\n\n\n《聖道東來考》是第一本系統整理關於基督教來華傳播的歷史述著，作者王元深，是禮賢會早期的華人傳道。王元深在1899年5月為本書撰序，相信本書最初完成於1899年。\n\n\n全書共有三十八頁，內文共十四章：〈景教東來考〉；〈英國倫敦傳道會入粵記〉；〈浸禮會入粵記〉；〈美國綱紀慎傳道會入粵記〉；〈英國安立間會入粵記〉；〈美國長老會入粵記〉；〈英國惠師禮會入粵記〉；〈福漢會入粵記〉；〈德國禮賢傳道會入粵記〉；〈附麥梅生追述禮賢會播道建堂事〉；〈德國巴色傳道會入粵考〉；〈香港巴陵育嬰堂考〉；〈德會小巴陵傳道會入粵考〉；〈附天主教東來考〉。其中有關禮賢會的篇幅最為詳盡，相信跟王元深個人的宗派關係及經歷有關。毋庸置疑。這是最早一本由華人撰寫的基督教各差會入粵的傳道記。\n\n\n王元深在自序中指：「國則有史，邑則有志，族則有譜，家則有傳，皆所以垂示將來，使後世之人，有所稽考，不至湮沒無傳」。他自述「信道頗早，各會入粵，猶親見之」，因此，希望可以整理這段歷史，讓「吾教會在粵之事實，永存不朽」。\n\n\n麥梅生在1906年為《聖道東來考》撰序時，也指出「教會史記所由作」的意義，在於「不忘所自」、「不忘其本」。他特別在馬禮遜來華百年前夕，推廣王元深將這本「流傳未廣」的史著，「藉以溯吾粵受道之源，且知西士為道遠來之苦」。\n\n(1) Non-Mainstream Pentecostal Movement\n\n(Yip Sin-Chuen 2021; Dai Koon-Ho 2020; Au 2019)\n\nIn the 1900s, alongside the Azusa Street Revival, the Pentecostal movement gained momentum, with Pentecostal missionaries arriving in Hong Kong. Undoubtedly, Hong Kong became one of the key regions for introducing the Pentecostal movement to China (Bays 1995: 129).\n\nThe Pentecostal movement in Hong Kong began in 1907 when Alfred G. Garr and his wife arrived, leading to the establishment of the Hong Kong Pentecostal Mission, a Chinese self-supporting church founded by Mok Lai-Chi and Sung Ting-Man. By the end of 1909, Anna M. Deane (?–1918) of the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church arrived in Hong Kong and gradually focused on ministering to fishermen, founding the American Pentecostal Mission, later renamed the Pentecostal Holiness Church.\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, other Pentecostal denominations, including the Assemblies of God, the Apostolic Faith Mission, and the Foursquare Gospel Church, established their presence in Hong Kong. These developments created a diverse Pentecostal landscape in the city.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the Pentecostal movement faced significant resistance from mainstream churches in Hong Kong, often labeled as heretical. However, by the 1920s, it began to gain acceptance from traditional denominations. According to a brief history of Pentecostal churches (Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union 1993: 189), \"In the early days, this church was mistakenly regarded by other believers in Hong Kong as heretical and was isolated. However, by 1927, the Hong Kong Christian Churches Union formally invited the church to join as a member congregation.\"\n\n\n(1)非主流傳統五旬節運動（葉先秦2021；戴觀豪 2020；Au 2019）\n\n\n1900年代，伴隨著亞蘇撒街復興，五旬節運動的興起，五旬宗背景的傳教士也來到香港。毋庸置疑，香港是五旬節運動入華的其中一個重要區域（Bays 1995:129）。香港五旬節運動，肇始於1907年嘉活力（Alfred G. Garr）夫婦抵港，並由莫禮智及宋鼎文成立華人自立的「香港五旬節會」。1909年底，會幕五旬節會（Tabernacle Pentecostal Church）的田安娜（Anna M. Deane, ?–1918）來港後，逐漸確立以漁民為宣教目標，建立「美國五旬節會」（後改稱五旬節聖潔會）。1920年代至1940年代，神召會（Assembly of God）、使徒信心會及四方福音會傳教士先後抵港開基，一幅多元的香港五旬宗運動圖像於焉建立起來。五旬節運動在二十世紀初入香港，受到主流教會的抵制，甚至被扣上「異端」之污名。不過，到二十年代以降，已漸獲主流教派接納。據五旬節堂的簡史（華人基督教聯會1993：189）指出，「本會成立初期，曾遭本港其他信徒誤認完全福音為異端而孤立」，但到1927年，香港基督教聯會「特別來函邀請本會加入聯會為會員堂」。\n\n\n\n\n(1) Christianity and the Founding Vision of the University of Hong Kong  \n\nReferences: Bishop of Victoria (1912: 154-158); Marshall (1996: 201); Mellor, Bernar (1980: 28-30)  \n\n\nSince the modern era, Western missionary societies had been actively involved in establishing Christian universities in China. In colonial Hong Kong, the founding of its first institution of higher education, the University of Hong Kong (HKU), in March 1912 also spurred discussions about its educational philosophy and its relationship with Christianity.  \n\n\nGovernor Frederick Lugard, the primary advocate for establishing HKU, envisioned it as “a British University in Hong Kong for China,” aspiring to make it the “Oxford and Cambridge of the Far East.” With significant efforts, enough funding was secured to establish the university, including a donation of nearly £18,000 from businessman Hormusjee Mody for building its campus. However, during the planning stages, Christian leaders in both Britain and Hong Kong debated the university’s value from a Christian perspective.  \n\n\nIn Britain, the Bishop of Exeter, Lord William G. Cecil, emphasized in his 1911 book Changing China the crucial role Christian universities played in promoting reform and fostering the vision of a “Christianized China.” He argued that HKU should be a Christian university rather than a “merely utilitarian university” guided by practical concerns. Lugard, however, saw the role of missionary societies as providing moral oversight in student hostels but resisted framing the university as a Christian institution. Cecil countered that the rise of science would erode traditional Chinese religious values, posing a significant risk if no higher ideals replaced them.  \n\n\nThe Bishop of Victoria, Gerald H. Lander, also expressed reservations about Lugard’s vision, noting that the university’s Christian character would depend on whether its appointed principal, professors, and lecturers held firm Christian beliefs and demonstrated personal piety. Nevertheless, Lander supported the involvement of missionary societies in overseeing HKU’s student hostels.  \n\n\nAs a result, several hostels with Christian affiliations were established: St. John’s College (Anglican), St. Stephen’s Hall (London Missionary Society), Morrison Hall, and Ricci Hall (Jesuit). Post-war, St. John’s College and St. Stephen’s Hall merged into the current St. John’s College.  \n\n\nUltimately, the colonial government chose not to adopt Christianity as HKU’s founding ethos. It was not until 1951, with the establishment of Chung Chi College by Christian leaders, that Hong Kong saw the realization of a Christian university.  \n\n(1) 基督教與香港大學的理念（Bishop of Victoria 1912: 154-158; Marshall 1996: 201; Mellor, Bernar1980: 28-30）\n\n\n自近代以來，歐美各差會在中國積極參與高等教育，興辦基督教大學。反觀在殖民地香港，首所高等學府──香港大學──在1912年3月成立前，也曾就其辦學理念與基督教的關係，作出討論。港督盧押（Frederick Lugard）是創建大學的主要推動者，他提出香港大學是「為中國而立的」（a British University in Hong Kong for China），其夢想更是將港大打造成「遠東的牛津和劍橋」。幾經努力，終於為創校籌措足夠經費，特別是商人麼地（Hormusjee Mody）捐獻近1.8萬英磅興建校舍。不過，在籌建港大的過程中，來自英國及香港的基督教領袖，卻從基督教信仰立場對大學的價值，提出不同的看法。在英國方面，艾希特教區主教（Bishop of Exeter）Lord William G. Cecil在1911年出版Changing China一書中，高度肯定基督教大學在推動中國變革扮演的角色，特別是促成「基督化中國」的宏願。因此，他力主這所殖民地大學應成為基督教大學，而非以「實用主義」（merely Utilitarian University）為導向的大學。對盧押而言，基督教差會可以在大學的舍堂中發揮道德規範的作用。但Cecil卻認為科學將掃除舊有中國宗教的價值，如果沒有其他「理想追求」取代，是極其危險的。\n\n\n維多利亞教區主科倫義華（Gerald H. Lander）也對盧押的構想有所保留，認為這取決於即將被任命為校長、教授和講師的人選，是否有明確的基督教信仰和個人虔誠。不過，他仍支持差會在香港大學的舍堂開展工作。最後，聖約翰堂（St. John’s College，）、聖士提反堂（St. Stephen’s Hall）、馬禮遜堂（ Morrison Hall）[戰後，聖約翰堂及聖士提反堂合併改建為聖約翰學院 St. John’s College]及利瑪竇堂（Ricci Hall）便分別由聖公會、倫敦會及天主教耶穌會負責。由於殖民地政府捨棄基督教作香港大學的理念，基督教大學在香港要延至1951年崇基學院，由基督教人士創建，始能成事。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### (1) Christ Issue  \n\n(Source: 邢福增 2014: 240–241)  \n\n\nThe Christ Issue, a special publication edited by Cheung Chu-Ling, the pastor of To Tsai Church, was released annually at Christmas starting in 1921. According to Lau Yuet-Sang, a total of over ten issues were published.  \n\n\nIn the preface to the second issue, Cheung Chu-Ling explained the purpose of the publication:  \n\n\n> \"The original aim of Christ Issue is to introduce the person of Christ to the intellectuals of Chinese society... However, in this era of blurred distinctions between right and wrong, it is not easy to lead people to believe in Christ, the ideal and supreme figure. Take, for example, the unfortunate rise of the Anti-Christian Alliance among China's educated youth earlier this year... Christianity, in its narrow sense, is about saving individuals, but in its broader sense, it is about saving the nation. The principles of Christianity—humility, purity, universal love, peace, equality, freedom, sacrifice, service, gentleness, perseverance, mutual assistance, loyalty, dedication, optimism, faith, and hope for eternal life—are foundational for both personal moral cultivation and public virtue. These principles are the foundation of true reform and national strength. Through the collective transformation of individuals into genuine reformers, we can build a supreme society and a resilient nation. Thus, Christ Issue dedicates itself to introducing Christ to our countrymen despite the challenges.\"  \n\n\nThe publication featured diverse content, including essays, educational articles, devotional reflections, sermons, poems, fiction, and accounts of Christmas celebrations. Contributors to the second issue included notable figures like Cheung Chu-Ling, Lau Yat-Sam, Leung Kwan-Muk, Lie Yuk-Kim, Liao Xin-Min, Chan Sau-Ming, Chan Sau-Yuen, Yip Kai-Fong, Chan Kam-Yung, Mai Mei-Sang, Kan Yau-Man, and Ma Yiu-Tung. Some of these writers, such as Leung Kwan-Muk, Yip Kai-Fong, Chan Kam-Yung, and Kan Yau-Man, were active in China's Christian intellectual circles at the time.  \n\n\nIn A History of Hong Kong Christianity, Lau Yuet-Sang praised the Christ Issue for making a significant contribution to the Chinese Christian literary scene.\n\n(1)《基督號》（邢福增2014：240-241）\n\n\n道濟會堂主任牧師張祝齡主編的《基督號》特刊，自1921年起，逢聖誕節出版，每年一期。據劉粵聲指出，《基督號》合共出版了十餘期。張祝齡在第二期的《基督號》弁言中說：「竊以為《基督號》之本旨，原為介紹基督一身，于吾國社會人士……然丁此邪正不分，是非淆紊之世，而欲以理想完滿，人格最高的基督，起芸芸眾庶的信從，洵非易易。不觀本歲春夏之交，吾國不幸而有智識階級青年之非教同盟發起乎……夫基督教狹義為救人的，廣義為救國的……舉凡基督主義，卓犖發揚之謙卑，清潔，博愛，和平，平等，自由，犧牲，服務，溫柔，恆忍，互助，忠貞，加以奮鬥精神，樂觀態度，誠實信仰，希望永生。明與隱的慎修，人與群的公德，微不循軌同趨，與時實現，是為基督化之教友，亦即真改革之國民，集合無數真改革之國民，組織最高尚的社會，新造至強固的國家，則以前種種譬如昨日死，從後皇種譬如今日生，又何患民貧國弱，為外人欺凌繆辱哉。是即本號不惜舌敝唇焦，再次紹介基督于吾國人之苦衷也。願同胞精察而體諒之。」\n\n\n內容方面，有論說、衛教、經筵、演壇、證道函、詩歌、雜俎、小說、聖誕遊藝等。作者方面，以第二期為例，除張祝齡外，尚包括劉日三、梁均默、烈汝儉、廖新民、陳秀明、陳壽源、葉啟芳、陳金鏞、麥梅生、簡又文、元道、馬耀東等。其中梁均默、葉啟芳、陳金鏞、簡又文等均為當時國內基督思想界活躍人士。劉粵聲在《香港基督教史》上，稱許其「在中國基督教之文壇上頗有貢獻」。\n\n\n\n\n(1) Dialogue and Controversy Between Christianity and Buddhism (Tong Wing-Sze 2019: 287-294; Li Zhihao 2006: 139-177)\n\nAfter its establishment in 1930, the Tao Fong Shan Christian Monastery initiated inter-religious dialogues in Hong Kong, particularly between Christianity and Buddhism. In its early years, Buddhist monks were the primary audience for its evangelistic efforts, and missionaries offered religious lecture courses to visitors. The founder of Sha Tin's Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery (established in 1957), Master Yuet Kai, visited Tao Fong Shan in 1933 as the 38th visiting monk (Huang Dicai 2015).\n\nIn the inaugural issue of Tao Fong, Karl Ludvig Reichelt wrote, “Jesus Christ is not merely a sage of one nation, one ethnicity, or one era. He is the eternal Word, without beginning or end, self-existent and everlasting, the foundation of all things, and the source of all life... From this abundant 'Word' flows endless living water—some in large streams, some in small streams, some belonging to the East, and some to the West. Each nation and sect, according to their unique forms, flows from this one 'Word,' ultimately returning to one truth. It is the hope of this publication that people of all nations and sects may freely drink from this vast spring and benefit from the fullness of the 'Word.'”\n\nThe monastery’s Tao Fong Shan Institute of Religious Studies welcomed both Christians from mainland China and a number of Buddhist and Taoist individuals to engage in discussions on religious truth. Visitors from various religious traditions, including Buddhist monks and laypeople, often engaged in dialogue or even debate about Christian beliefs with those at the monastery. For example, one monk named Liaoyi, who transitioned from Tibetan Buddhism to Zen Buddhism, studied the Bible at Tao Fong Shan and discussed the concept of salvation in Christianity with Reverend Wong King Hing. Liaoyi regarded Jesus as a sage but questioned how Jesus fulfilled the plan to redeem humanity.\n\nReichelt’s inculturation approach, which included elements of Buddhism, inevitably drew criticism from the broader Christian community, with accusations of syncretism. For instance, the original name of the chapel, \"Jingzun Bao Dian\" (Hall of Revered Scenery), was misunderstood by some to refer to a Buddhist deity. In 1945, Reverend Wong King Hing renamed the hall as the \"Sanctuary\" (Sheng Dian). The couplet inscribed on either side of the hall, which originally read \"The divine light shines universally; the great vow guides the compassionate vessel,\" was changed to \"The Word was with God; the wind blows wherever it pleases.\" These modifications aimed to address external critiques of Tao Fong Shan’s practices and maintain its Christian identity.\n\n\n(1)耶佛對話與爭議（湯泳詩2019：287-294；李智浩2006：139-177）\n\n\n道風山基督教叢林在1930年創立後，開啟了香港宗教之間，特別是基督教與佛教的對話。早年以佛教僧侶為主要傳教對象，傳教士為眾來訪者提供宗教講座課程。創建沙田萬佛寺(1957) 的主持— 月溪法師，曾於1933年訪問道風山，是為第38位到訪僧侶 (黃棣才2015)。\n\n\n艾香德在《道風》，發刊詞中說：「耶穌基督不是一國一族一時代的聖賢，乃是太初的大道，無始無終，自有永有，萬物的根本，眾生的泉源……從這充滿的『道』，要流出無窮的活水，有的大流，有的小流，有的屬乎東方，有的屬乎西方，從各民族各宗派按著他們原有的格式，在一個『道』中流出，仍就歸於一個真理，使各民族各宗派的人，都能放懷暢飲這寬闊的泉源，都能從豐滿的『道』中得益，這是本刊的盼望。」叢林設有道風山宗教研究院，除收錄來自內地的基督徒外，又有若干佛家及道家人士，共同研討宗教真理。\n\n來訪道風山的教教和佛教會侶及居士，跟叢林中人就基督教信仰問題展開交流甚至辯論，例如有一位「了義」法師，由密宗轉入禪宗，在山上讀畢聖經，與王景慶牧師討論基督教的救恩問題，認為耶穌可視為聖人，卻質疑耶穌如何完成救贖人類的計劃。\n\n\n艾香德具佛教化的本色化實踐，難免引起教會的非議，指其乃宗教混合主義（syncretism）。對此，原本名「景尊寶殿」的禮堂，卻被人誤會「景尊」為佛教的神，到1945年王景慶牧師改為「聖殿」，殿兩旁的對聯「靈光普耀，大願慈航」，則改為「道與上帝同在，風隨意思吹」。上述改變，旨在回應外界對道風山的抨擊。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Hong Kong Edition of the Chinese Bible (Xing Fuzeng, 2013)\n\n\nDue to the tense political situation in China, the Executive Committee of the National Bible Society of China, headquartered in Shanghai, decided in 1948 to send David McGavin, a Western secretary, to Hong Kong to explore the possibility of printing Chinese Bibles there. Upon his arrival, McGavin collaborated with the Hong Kong Bible Society, using its office to begin operations. By late 1949, Bibles printed in Hong Kong could no longer be shipped to Shanghai and had to be distributed locally. The first Hong Kong edition of the Chinese Bible was released in early 1950. By then, communication with the Shanghai office had dwindled and was fully severed the following year. The Hong Kong office assumed independent operations, becoming the \"Hong Kong Bible House\" and taking over the responsibility of supplying Bibles worldwide, previously managed by the Shanghai headquarters.\n\n\nThe newly established Hong Kong Bible House also functioned as the Hong Kong Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society, publishing its annual reports under this title. In 1960, the organization underwent restructuring to include participation from the American, Scottish, and Canadian Bible Societies, and was renamed the \"Hong Kong Auxiliary of the Bible Society.\" The Hong Kong Bible House also changed its name to the \"Bible Societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\" However, in November 1964, Hong Kong and Taiwan decided to manage their finances separately, leading to the removal of \"Taiwan\" from the name. From 1965 onward, it officially published its reports as the \"Hong Kong Bible Society.\"\n\n\nBetween 1949 and August 1952, the Hong Kong Bible Society printed 28 editions of the Bible, 12 editions of the New Testament, and nine single books (primarily the Gospels and Acts), totaling 2,485,975 copies. In addition to Mandarin editions, the society also printed versions in Xiamenese, Hlai, Bunong, Vietnamese, and other languages. These Bibles were distributed not only in Hong Kong and Taiwan but also across Southeast Asia (e.g., Burma, Siam, Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, and the South Seas Islands), as well as New Zealand, South America, Mexico, the United States, India, Europe, and South Africa. Hong Kong became a global hub for the supply of Chinese Bibles, as well as Bibles in Chinese dialects and various other languages.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Hymnals (Xing Fuzeng, 2013)\n\n\nOver the past 50 years, various denominations in Hong Kong have met the needs of their congregations by reprinting hymnals previously published in China while also facing the challenge of revising or creating new hymnals. Below are summaries of key hymnals:\n\n\n Hymns of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (1950) and Youth Hymnal (1951–1973):  \n\nThe Christian and Missionary Alliance's Hymns of the Christian and Missionary Alliance was compiled in 1940 by Liu Fukwan and included 287 hymns. After relocating from Wuzhou to Hong Kong in 1949, Liu re-established the Alliance Bible Seminary in Hong Kong and oversaw the publication of the hymnal in 1950 through the Alliance Bookroom.\n\n\nIn the fall of 1950, Liu conceived the idea of creating a bilingual hymnal for spiritually wounded youth and enlisted the help of Ho Tung Hung, who had also relocated from Wuzhou. The first hymn translated was Cleanse Me. Over time, they continued translating hymns, publishing each set of 50 as a volume of the Youth Hymnal through the Alliance Bookroom. From 1951 to 1973, ten volumes were published, with Liu working on the final volume before his death in 1972. Ho continued the project, publishing the 11th and 12th volumes in 1981. Comprehensive editions were also released in 1960, 1970, and 1981, with total circulation reaching approximately 400,000 copies. The first volume alone sold 45,000 copies by 1971. Liu noted that the hymnal emphasized themes of evangelism and Christ's return, making it popular across denominational lines and widely adopted by youth fellowships.\n\n\n Hymns of Praise (1953):  \n\nThe Hymns of Praise, long used by the China Inland Mission (CIM), underwent revisions as early as the 19th century. After several updates, a revised edition was published in 1950 by the CIM's publishing arm, later rebranded as the Truth & Life Press in Hong Kong. The hymnal reached its 12th edition by 1965.\n\n\n Hymns of Praise (1954):  \n\nThis hymnal, initially developed in the U.S. under the leadership of I. Daehlin of the Lutheran Church in 1915, was first published in China in 1920 as a provisional edition. It was revised in 1924 and included 450 hymns, 6% of which were original Chinese compositions. Further revisions were planned in 1946 but delayed until 1955 due to political upheavals. The final revision in Hong Kong included 600 hymns and incorporated selections from earlier editions.\n\n\nHymns of Universal Praise (1955):  \n\nIn the 1920s, six major Christian denominations in China formed a committee to compile a joint hymnal, resulting in the publication of Hymns of Universal Praise in 1936 by the Christian Literature Society in Shanghai. It was reprinted in Hong Kong by the Christian Literature Bookroom in 1955.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Christian Literature and Theological Translations (Xing Fuzeng, 2013)\n\n\nThe Christian Literature Bookroom in Hong Kong inherited the publishing vision of the Christian Literature Society in Shanghai, emphasizing openness and a global perspective. Under the leadership of Executive Committee Chairman Chou Yuk Hei (1959–1966) and Secretary-General Hubert W. Spillett (1953–1967), its key publishing focuses included:  \n\n1. Christianity and Chinese culture,  \n\n2. Modern Christian thought,  \n\n3. Biblical interpretation,  \n\n4. Contemporary issues,  \n\n5. Christian family life,  \n\n6. Christian education,  \n\n7. Creative works and translations, and  \n\n8. Stories and novels.\n\n\nThis approach reflected the Bookroom's commitment to global engagement and modern relevance, distinguishing it in Hong Kong's Christian publishing landscape.\n\n\nAnother significant initiative was the publication of the Collected Works of Christian Classics. Initially managed by the Nanjing Theological Seminary Trust Department under Methodist missionary Francis P. Jones in the 1940s, the project relocated to Drew University in the U.S. in 1951. The collection consisted of three series with over 30 volumes, with the first volume published in September 1952. These translations represented a major achievement in the field of theological and ecclesiastical literature in Hong Kong during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n(1) 香港版中文聖經（邢福增 2013）\n\n 由於中國局勢緊張，總部位於上海的中華聖經會執委會於1948年議決，先派一位西籍秘書麥興仁（David McGavin）來港，考慮轉移到香港印製中文聖經的問題。來港後，麥氏與香港聖書公會聯絡，借用其辦事處，並於1949年底開始工作，當時印妥的聖經已不能運到上海而要在香港卸下。首批港版中文聖經於1950年初面世。這時，香港辦事處與與上海中華聖經會的聯絡已日漸縮少（到翌年更完全中斷），並取代其工作，成為獨立的代理機關，稱「香港聖經會」（Hong Kong Bible House），負起以前中華聖經會供應世界各地聖經的責任。\n\n\n新成立的香港聖經會，同時具備「英國聖書公會香港輔導委員會」（British and Foreign Bible Society, Hong Kong Auxiliary）的身份，甚至每年的年報，也是以後者名義出版的。1960年起，該會改組，除英國聖書公會外，增加了美國、蘇格蘭及加拿大的聖經會的參與，名稱改為「聖經公會香港輔導會」（Hong Kong Auxiliary of the Bible Society）。而香港聖經會也易名為「香港及台灣聖經公會」（Bible Societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan）。1964年11月起，港台兩地決定分開帳目，故移除名字中的「台灣」名稱，重新命名為「香港聖經公會」（Bible Societies in Hong Kong）。1965年起，便正式以香港聖經公會名義出版年報。\n\n\n從1949至1952年8月間，香港聖經會合共印了廿八版聖經，十二版新約全書及九版的單行本（主要是四福音書和使徒行傳），總數達2485975冊，除了國語本外，尚有廈門語、華黎族語、東黎族語、Bunman族語、越南語等。聖經供給的地區，除香港及台灣外，更達東南亞各國（如緬甸、暹羅、越南、馬來亞、印尼、菲律賓、日本、南洋群島），甚至新西蘭、南美洲、墨西哥、美國、印度及歐洲及南菲等處。香港成為全球中文聖經供應中心，除中文聖經外，又印製其他中國方言及不同國家語文聖經。\n\n(2) 聖詩（邢福增 2013）\n\n五十年來以降，各宗派在港為滿足信徒的需要，一方面將原有在中國刊行的詩集重印，另方面也面對修訂及新修詩集的挑戰。茲簡介各主要詩集的情況：\n\n《宣道詩》（1950）與《青年聖歌》（1951-1973）：宣道會的中文詩歌《宣道詩》是1940年由劉福群編纂，收錄了287首聖詩。 1949年，劉福群從梧州抵港，籌備建道在港復校。1950年，《宣道詩》也在香港的宣道書局出版。\n\n\n1950年秋，劉福群萌生為心靈創傷的青年人編一本中英對照詩集的念頭。於是他找來從梧州來港的何統雄協助翻譯。第一首譯的聖詩就是 Cleanse Me （潔淨我）。 此後，他們繼續翻譯，每譯畢五十首時，便以《青年聖歌》之名，由宣道書局出版。1951年出版第一集以來，至劉福群在1972年病逝，共出版了九集（1954、1956、1959、1964、1967、1968、1969、1971），劉離世前參與的第十集也在1973年出版。後來何氏仍繼續有關工作，於1981年出版第十一及十二集。1960年，宣道書局又出版了《青聖綜合本（一）》，《青聖綜合本（二）》及《青聖綜合本（三）》分別在1970及1981年出版。據統計，《青聖》單行本的印行量多年來共達353,905冊，而《青聖》之三本綜合本，其印行量約為四十萬本。\n\n\n《青年聖詩》第一集於1951年面世以來，一直深受各地華人教會及信徒的歡迎。劉福群指，他選擇的詩歌「着重傳福音及主再來的信息」，因此能夠受到跨宗派的擁戴，不同宗派的青年團契，均採用這本詩集。在1971年，單是第一集就售出了45,000本。\n\n\n《頌主聖歌》（1953）：內地會沿用的《頌主聖歌》，早於十九世紀已問世使用，並於1900年作修正。1917年，成立詩歌委員會再修修訂，其於1921年出版新版，後又於1941年重訂。1950年，內地會又出版修正版，但不以內地會名義，而改由廣協書局出版，並獲楊紹唐撰寫序言。內地會出版部遷港，並改組為證道出版社後，於1953年再版《頌主聖歌》，到1965年已出至十二版。\n\n\n《頌主聖詩》（1954）：《頌主聖詩》自1915年起即在美國的戴懷仁（I. Daehlin）領導下開始編修，終於在1920年中華信義會成立時出版了《暫用文字本》。1924年，信義書報部出版了《頌主聖詩修正本》，除文字本外，也印行了曲譜本。負責修訂的謝受靈及唐務道（Olav Dalland）將詩歌總數減至450首，其中百分之六為中文創作。1946年，中華信義會第七屆大會再次通過重修，並於1948年成立編修委會，由馬天生任主席。但因政局急變，這一重修計劃延遲到1955年才在香港完成。\n\n\n 1951年9月，出版部通過授權馬天生及汪爕堯二教授物色適當人員進行修訂。馬牧師在顏路裔、王翰章、朱學賢等協助下完成是項重要工作。1954年，新的《頌主聖詩簡譜本》問世，翌年，線譜本亦告出版。該詩本共有詩歌六百首，其中二百四十六首選自1920年和1924年的詩本。 \n\n\n《普天頌讚》（1955）：1920年代，中國基督教六大公會（中華基督教會全國總會、中華聖公會、美以美會、華北公理會、華東浸禮會及監理會），決定組成「六公會聯合聖歌委員會」，編修聯合詩歌集。1936年，由上海廣學會出版《頌天頌讚》。1955年，輔僑在港再版《普天頌讚》。\n\n\n(3) 基督教文字及神學編譯（邢福增 2013）\n\n基督教輔僑出版社，由於承繼了廣學會的出版路線，在出版方針上，較具開放性及普世性。在1959至1966年任執委會主席的周郁晞，在總幹事蘇佩禮（Hubert W. Spillet）退休卸任時，曾總結蘇氏任期（1953至1967）年間的出版重點：（一）基督教與中國文化；（二）現代基督教的思想；（三）聖經的解釋方法；（四）現代問題；（五）基督化家庭；（六）基督教教育；（七）創作與翻譯；（八）故事與小說。其中在信仰與文化、時代思潮及，現代社會問題，以及譯經學新方法方面，在在反映出輔僑的普世化取向，在當時整個香港基督教文字出版版圖上，具有其獨到的特色。\n\n\n輔僑（文藝）另一項重要的事工，就是出版「基督教歷代名著集成」。整套叢書的編譯工作原由金陵神學院託事部主持，把基督教二千年來的重要典籍譯成中文。籌備工作於四十年代期開始，主事者為衛理公會傳教士章文新（Francis P. Jones）。1951年，託事部決定在美國繼續有關工作，並於美國哲吾大學（Drew University）附設編譯所。叢書包括三部，合共30多卷。首冊於1952年9月出版。這套叢書，可說是五十至六十年代香港文字出版事業中，在教會及神學文獻漢譯方面的重要成果。\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Tensions Between Churches and Student Fellowships  \n\n(Hing 2004: 168-169)  \n\n\nEvangelical student movements that began in the late 1950s were not widely accepted by mainstream denominational churches. Many churches viewed student ministries as disruptive to denominational unity. Events like the Evangelical Centre Movement in the early 1960s and the St. Paul’s Seven incident further reinforced these perceptions. Church leaders often blamed student fellowships for church splits.  \n\n\nFor example, in the case of the youth group at Caine Road Baptist Church, young members who left to establish Bonham Road Evangelical Centre used the Evangelical Reading Room as a base for prayer and Bible study, inviting pastors such as Lee Fei-wu and John Chan to guide them. Evangelical leader Stephen Tong acknowledged that students often left churches due to dissatisfaction, with some bringing pride into churches without contributing but expecting leadership roles or being overly critical. This strained the relationship between student fellowships and churches.  \n\n\nFrom the church perspective, youth engagement in student ministries often came at the expense of local church service, representing a significant loss. Some church leaders, unable to adopt a broader perspective of the \"invisible church,\" sought to limit youth involvement in campus fellowships, viewing such activities as detrimental to the local congregation.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Social Responsibility of Christianity  \n\n\nThe 1966 and 1967 riots significantly impacted Hong Kong society, prompting reflection within the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC). In its 1969 work review, the council noted that improvements were needed in both political and economic organization to create a more humane society. However, churches had largely neglected their call to contribute to societal welfare (Hing 2018b: 42).  \n\n\nThe influence of fundamentalist traditions meant that many Chinese churches in Hong Kong remained unaware of their social responsibilities. Historical debates between fundamentalism and liberal theology further deepened this divide, with fundamentalists often rejecting social concern as part of the \"social gospel\" or labeling it as modernist theology or unbelief.  \n\n\nStephen Tong was among the first evangelical pastors in Hong Kong to reflect on the isolationist tendencies of fundamentalism. Speaking at the 1966 Congress on the Church’s Worldwide Mission in Wheaton, Illinois, Tong emphasized that while the primary mission of the church was to evangelize and save souls, acts of loving service, such as education, healthcare, and welfare, also held value in evangelism. However, he maintained a hierarchical view, prioritizing evangelism over social responsibility. This stance became a mainstream narrative within Chinese evangelical circles (Hing 2018b: 165-166).  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) Achieving Self-Sufficiency and Autonomy  \n\n\nFrom the 1960s, various mission organizations began planning for the financial and organizational independence of local churches.  \n\n\n- Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA):  \n\n  In 1959, the C&MA initiated a five-year self-sufficiency plan. Starting in 1960, subsidies from Western missions to local churches were reduced by 20% annually, aiming for full self-sufficiency by 1964. By 1963, 10 C&MA churches in Hong Kong achieved financial independence, while nine newly established congregations were still reliant on external support (Ho 2021: 287-290).  \n\n\n- Lutheran Church – Hong Kong Synod:  \n\n  Established in 1954 with support from eight mission organizations, the Hong Kong Synod reached a self-support agreement in 1962. Under this agreement, subsidies from missions were reduced by one-seventh annually, ceasing entirely by the end of 1970 (Wu 1962: 3).  \n\n\n- Church of Christ in China (CCC):  \n\n  Starting in 1964, the CCC announced a phased reduction of foreign financial support, excluding social welfare work. Subsidies for local congregations and schools were decreased by 10% annually, with full self-sufficiency targeted by 1974. Congregations were also required to increase their contributions to the district council by 10% annually based on 1963 levels (Wang 1963: 5).  \n\n\nThese measures reflected a broader movement toward autonomy and sustainability, marking a significant transition in the financial and administrative structure of Hong Kong churches.  \n\n(1)教會與學生團契的張力（邢福增2004：168-169）\n\n\n五十年代後期開始的學生福音工作，並不為主流宗派教會所接納。一方面，主流教會普遍抗拒學生福音工作，認為學生福音工作衝擊宗派教會。特別是經歷了六十年代初的福音堂運動及聖保羅七子事件後，部分教會領袖更認定學生團契要為教會分裂負上責任。就以堅道浸信會少年團事件為例，當時脫離浸會成立般含道福音堂的青年人，在脫離教會的過程中，便在福音閱覽室禱告讀經聚會，邀請了李非吾、陳約翰等牧者帶領。滕近輝也承認，青年學生在教會中發現一些不合意的事，便很容易退出教會。部分學生或畢業生也「帶著驕傲到教會裡來，尚未有貢獻之先，就要作領袖，或老是批評」，結果拆斷了學生工作與教會的橋樑。另方面，膝近輝也指出，教會認為教會中熱心的青年信徒因熱衷學生工作，而輕忽了地方教會的事奉。從教會的立場來看，是莫大的損失。教會領袖因著「近視」，未能站在「整個無形教會的立場」，結果設法攔阻青年在學校團契的工作。\n\n\n(2) 基督教的社會責任\n\n\n六六及六七年兩次暴動給香港社會帶來巨大的震盪。協進會在回顧1969年的工作時，指出香港社會不論在政治及經濟生活組織方面皆有改善之必要，「以求對更多人更富於人道」，但教會卻忽視了向社會多作貢獻和服務的召命（邢福增2018b：42）。\n\n\n不過，由於受基要主義傳統影響，香港華人教會對社關責任仍未有充分的醒覺。加上歷史上新舊神學的爭論，基要派與自由派處於二元對立的位置，其反社會福音（social gospel）的立場，動輒出現「聞『社會』色變」的傾向，將任何社會關懷視作社會福音及新派神學，甚至標簽為「不信派」。\n\n\n滕近輝牧師對基要主義的封閉有所反思，可說是香港較早提出關心社會的福音派牧者，他在1966年在美國惠敦大學召開的「教會普世使命會議」（Congress on the Church’s Worldwide Mission）上指出，教會的主要工作是傳揚福音拯救世人，但聖靈也顯明：「愛心的服務在佈道工作中有其價值。學校，醫院，福利等工作，是否可以歸入此類？無疑，它們具有兩種意義：佈道的工具，愛心的表現」。可以說，對滕氏而言，傳福音與社會責任間，仍有主次的優先次序問題。這成為華人福音派的主流論述（邢福增2018b：165-166）。\n\n\n(3) 實現自養與自治\n\n\n1960年代開始，個別差會開始按部就班地為教會自養與自立作部署。\n\n\n宣道會方面早於1959年制定五年自養計劃，自1960年開始，西差會給予本地教會的資助，將縮減五分之一，然後逐年遞減，期望在1964年本地堂會可以自養自給。1963年，宣道會共有10間堂會成功自養自立（另有9間新成立不久仍未自立）（何明章 2021：287-290）。\n\n\n香港信義會於1954年成立，參加支持的差會包括豫鄂、豫中、豫東、魯東、湘中、湘西、湘北、豫鄂陝等8個。1962年各差會與香港信義會達成「自立自養」協議，由1962年起，差會的津貼每年減少七分之一，至1970年底完全停止對教會經常費之一切支持（吳明節1962：3）。\n\n\n中華基督教會方面，亦宣佈自1964年起，除社會福利事工外，外國合作教會的其他助款每年減少10%，到1974年達致完全自養。區會對各堂之補助，亦每年逐步減少10%，各學校的助款亦同樣逐步減少。而各堂對區會的捐款，亦照1963年所捐額每年增加10%（汪彼得1963：5）。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) The First Split of the \"Church in Hong Kong\" (Kung Sheung Daily News 1970; Wu Longyun 2018:65-67; Witness Lee 2001:259-274, 294-315)\n\n\nThe \"Church in Hong Kong,\" located on Observatory Road, originated from Watchman Nee's Local Church movement, and its meeting hall was completed in 1950. After 1955, internal divisions emerged within the church. Wei Guangxi followed Witness Lee, while Chen Zexin considered Lee's teachings to be an Arian \"heresy,\" particularly Lee's claim that Christ incarnate was a \"created being.\" Witness Lee responded in October 1970 by writing A Brief Rebuttal. In November 1970, during a sermon delivered by Witness Lee and Zhang Wuchen in Hong Kong, a conflict erupted at the Observatory Road meeting hall involving over 100 followers from both sides. The police were eventually called to handle the situation, and the incident was reported by the news media. \n\n\nAfter the clash, Witness Lee and others wrote an Open Letter to Brother Chen Zexin, accusing Chen of \"unfounded accusations\" and demanding an apology. Subsequently, the dispute over the ownership of the Observatory Road meeting hall went to court, where the court ruled that both sides could use the venue jointly. Eventually, an out-of-court settlement was reached, with Chen Zexin's group withdrawing, allowing those who supported Witness Lee to continue using the Observatory Road meeting hall under the name \"Church in Hong Kong.\" Meanwhile, the tradition associated with Chen Zexin came to be known as the \"Christian Assembly.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) The Controversy over the New Testament Chinese Translation (1972) (Leung Koon Ting, n.d.)\n\n\nIn 1972, the Chinese Bible Translation Committee (CBTC) was established, with founding members including James Hudson Taylor III, Teng Hsiao-Ching, Bao Huiyuan, Tang Youzhi, Sang Anzhu, Hsieh Youwang, Chen Zhongdao, Wu Yong, Shao Qingzhang, Mai Weidi, and Yung Paul. The establishment of CBTC originated from the “Chinese Bible Translation Symposium” and the “New Bible Translation Seminar” held earlier that year. During the seminar, an executive committee was formally established as the decision-making body of CBTC, with Pastor Teng Hsiao-Ching elected as chairman and Paul Yung appointed as general secretary.\n\n\nFor the New Testament translation team, Bao Huiyuan served as the planner and leader, while Tang Youzhi was responsible for the Old Testament. Sang Anzhu led the stylistic editing team. In September 1973, a trial version of The Gospel of John was published, emphasizing faithfulness, readability, and elegance. A revised version was released early the following year.\n\n\nVeteran writer Liu Yiling offered harsh criticism of the new translation, primarily addressing linguistic issues. His critiques focused on replacing compound words with single characters, converting colloquial expressions to classical Chinese, the use of four-character idioms, arbitrary addition or removal of modal particles, the extension of short sentences into long ones, and the usage of conjunctions. He argued that the translators seemed to change things simply for the sake of change, asserting that the new version even \"turned good into bad.\" General Secretary Paul Yung responded in a series of articles under his name, addressing Liu's points and claiming that Liu's criticisms were overly subjective. These exchanges were published in Life Magazine by The Word Publishing House.\n\n\nWhen the full New Testament Chinese Translation was published in 1976, some critics authored books to challenge or even refute it, generally asserting the unshakable status of the Union Version. Liu Yiling's 1979 book, Essays on Bible Translation, included some of his earlier critiques from Life Magazine, along with insights from Luo Xianglin, Chen Zhongdao, Xu Songshi, Zhang Lisheng, and Yu Zhongmin. In the editor's preface, Liu stated, \"The anti-Bible movement that began in the 1970s and the defensive backlash it provoked undoubtedly constituted a fierce battle.\"\n\n\nThe Old Testament section of the New Translation was eventually completed in 1992.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) The Lausanne Covenant and Evangelical Social Concern (1974) (Xing Fuzeng 2018:139-140)\n\n\nThe 1974 Lausanne Congress on World Evangelization, held in Switzerland, was a pivotal event in evangelical history. The Lausanne Covenant emphasized Christian social responsibility in its fifth clause. The covenant was later translated into Chinese by participating Chinese representatives, notably Tang Youzhi. \n\n\nIt is worth noting that the 1974 Chinese translation did not render terms such as \"exploited\" (exploited) and \"political liberation\" (political liberation) from the English original. The original sentence, \"Here too we express penitence both for our neglect and for having sometimes regarded evangelism and social concern as mutually exclusive\", was translated as, \"We hereby express penitence for neglecting both evangelism and social concern, and for regarding the two as mutually exclusive,\" equating the neglect of evangelism with the neglect of social concern.\n\n\nLater, the official Chinese version was revised, as seen on the covenant's website (<http://www.lausanne.org/zh-hant/covenant-zh-tw/lausanne-covenant>). However, the 1974 translation rendered \"social action,\" \"socio-political involvement,\" and \"social concern\" uniformly as \"social concern,\" losing the nuanced distinctions of the original English terms. This uniformity reflected the Chinese evangelicals’ understanding of \"social concern,\" which differed somewhat from the Lausanne vision. \n\n\nIn the 1970s, Chinese evangelicals appeared intent on downplaying the covenant's emphasis on social responsibility. John Stott, who wrote The Lausanne Covenant: An Exposition and Commentary, acknowledged that evangelicals had previously separated evangelism and social concern due to opposition to the social gospel and liberal optimism. His works, Walk in His Shoes (1975) and Balanced Christianity (1975), translated into Chinese in 1980, highlighted attempts to establish a balance between evangelism and social concern.\n\n\nIn 1971, Teng Hsiao-Ching was invited by the Hong Kong Christian Council to deliver two speeches at the second Mission Consultation. He emphasized that Christians had played a significant reforming role in human history, that \"personal salvation\" could manifest in \"social relationships,\" and that Christian truth encompassed both \"personal\" and \"social\" dimensions. Churches, he argued, must understand \"the characteristics and needs of each era\" and explore \"new ways\" to provide \"creative contributions\" to society.\n\n(1)「香港教會」第一次分裂 （工商日報1970；吳龍雲2018：65-67；李常受2001：259-274，294-315）\n\n\n「香港教會」位於天文道台，源自倪柝聲的地方教會，於1950年落成的聚會所。1955年後，教會內部出現分裂，魏光禧追隨李常受，而陳則信則認為李所傳講為亞流派的「異端」，特別是李稱成為肉體的基督為「受造之物」。李常受於1970年10月撰〈一點的駁正〉作回應。1970年11月李常受與張晤晨來香港講道時，雙方信徒合共百多名信徒在天文台道會所內爆發衝突，最後要警察上來處理，事件更為新聞媒體報導。突衝後，李常受等撰〈致陳則信弟兄的公開信〉，指陳等「妄加罪名」，要求其道歉。後來雙方就天文台道聚會所的產權鬧上法庭，法院裁定雙方共同使用會所。後庭外和解，陳則信等最後退出，認同李常受者繼續使用天文台道，稱「香港教會」，至於陳則信的傳統，則稱「基督徒聚會所」。\n\n\n(2)《新約全書新譯本》爭議 1972（梁冠霆nd）\n\n\n1972年，中文聖經新譯會成立，創會委員包括戴紹曾（James Hudson Taylor III）、滕近輝、鮑會園、唐佑之、桑安柱、謝友王、陳終道、吳勇、邵慶彰、麥維惕及容保羅。新譯會的成立，源自1972年初召開的「中文聖經翻譯座談會」及「新譯聖經研討會」，在研討會期間，正式成立執行委員會，此乃中文聖經新譯會的決策機構，最後選出滕近輝牧師為主席，並委任容保羅出任總幹事。在組織方面，新約翻譯組由鮑會園策劃與領導，舊約方面由唐佑之負責，修辭組的負責人為桑安柱。1973年9月，《約翰福音新譯本》試驗版面世，強調其翻譯是信、達、雅三方面並重；翌年初修版完成面世。文壇老將劉翼凌對新譯本的批評甚為嚴厲，主要從語文運用方面論其得失，尤其對「叠字」改為單字、將白話改為文言、四字詞使用方式、語氣詞的隨意加減、短句化長、副聯詞的用法等各方面予以細緻的批評，且認為新譯本的譯者似乎有「為改譯而改譯」的態度，就文體而論，甚至「把好的都改壞了」。總幹事容保羅牧師以個人名義發表一系列回應文章，與劉氏逐點商榷，認為他的主觀成分太重。這些批評和回應文章皆發表於聖道出版社的《生命雜誌》。\n\n\n1976年《新約全書新譯本》問世不久，部分批評者即著書提出商榷甚至反擊，大致上認為《和合本》的地位不容動搖。劉翼凌編著的《譯經論叢》（1979），部分選錄自他早前在《生命雜誌》發表過的批評文章，也收錄了羅香林、陳終道、徐松石、章力生及于中旻等人的見解。在編者自序中，劉翼凌開宗明義指出：「從二十世紀七十年代開始的謗經運動，與由此激發的護經反擊，無疑是一場激戰。」\n\n\n新譯本舊約全書部分，最後於1992年完成。\n\n\n(3)〈洛桑信約〉與福音派的社會關懷 1974（邢福增2018：139-140）\n\n\n1974年在瑞士舉行的洛桑會議（Lausanne Congress on World Evangelization, 1974），在福音派歷史上可說舉足輕重。會議提出的〈洛桑信約〉，其中第五條強調了基督徒的社會責任（Christian social responsibility），〈信約〉後來由與會的華人代表翻譯成中文，其中一位很重要的就是唐佑之。值得留意的是，1974年的中譯版並沒有將英文原文中使用的「剝削」（exploited）及「政治解放」（political liberation）譯出來。而原文 “Here too we express penitence both for our neglect and for having sometimes regarded evangelism and social concern as mutually exclusive.” 則被譯作「我們在此表示懺悔， 因忽略佈道和社會關懷，並認為這二者是互相排斥的。」將原文強調對社會關懷的忽略而作的懺悔，跟對「佈道」的忽略置於同等位置。\n\n\n後來官方中文版對1974年的中譯本再作修訂，可見信約的網站(http://www.lausanne.org/zh-hant/covenant-zh-tw/lausanne-covenant)。不過，1974譯本把social action, socio-political involvement，與原文別處使用的social concern一樣，全譯作「社會關懷」的處理，在官方中文版仍予保留，原文的social concern, involvement, action一律譯成「關懷」，似乎失去了原文的不同重點，而統一以「關懷」概括之。從1974年的譯本到官方修訂譯本，多少看到華人福音派對社會「關懷」的想法，跟洛桑會議也有落差。七十年代華人福音派，似乎有意淡化信約在社關方面的表述。\n\n\n另方面，司托德（John Stott）為〈洛桑信約〉撰寫註The Lausanne Covenant: an Exposition and Commentary，在1975年也在香港出版，其中承認過往福音派因為反對社會福音、自由派的樂觀主義，而將福音與社會關懷割裂；而肯定基督徒社會責任的神學基礎在上帝觀、人觀、救贖觀、國度觀。而司托德另外兩本相關著作，也被譯成中文，並於1980年出版：\n\n《傳福音與社會關懷》（Walk in His Shoes: The Compassion of Jesus, 1975）（宣道）及《平衡的基督教》（Balanced Christianity, 1975）（天道）。從中譯書名可見，福音派嘗試在「社會關懷」與「傳福音」之間，建立「平衡」的關係。\n\n\n1971年，滕近輝應香港基督教協進會邀請，在第二屆使命諮詢會議上作了兩個演講。他強調了基督徒「在人類歷史中起了很大的改良作用」，「個人的救恩」可表現在「社會的關係中」，基督真理兼具「個人性」和「社會性」。教會必須了解「每一時代的特點與特需」，探索以「新的方式」對社會作「創造性的供應」。教會可以採取醫療、教育、影音、服務及文字等途徑，「但這一切必須達成其最高目標：榮神救人」。\n\n\n在洛桑會議上，滕近輝負責主講其中一節靈修，他雖沒有直接觸及社會責任的問題，但他以使徒行傳中亞拿尼亞及保羅為例，指出前者代表「個人佈道」（personal evangelism），而後者則代表上帝另一種作為，即興起其他佈道領袖去回應時代需要，先革命化個人，進而將世界革命化（God revolutionizes the world through people who are revolutionized by God first）。可以說，藉個人見證影響社會，成為七十年代以降華人福音派社會關懷的主流立場。\n\n\n (4) The Baptism Agreement Between the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, 1974 (Christian Echo 1974; Fu Junhao 2018:106-107)\n\n\nIn March 1974, the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong signed a baptism agreement, reaffirming that baptisms conducted by both churches, regardless of ceremony and tradition, were based on the baptism established by Christ in the Bible. The agreement guaranteed the validity of baptisms performed by both sides and required that baptisms be recorded in registers for future reference. This agreement symbolized the progress of unity between the Anglican and Catholic Churches.\n\n\nRepresentatives present at the signing ceremony included Bishop Lei Wang-kee, Auxiliary Bishop Secondo Einaudi, Father Edward F. Malone, and Father Tong Hon from the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong. Representing the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau were Bishop John Gilbert Hind White, Archdeacon Cheung Shiu-kwai, Chancellor Reverend Cheung Luk-heung, and Reverend Stephen Sidebotham.\n\n\nIn 1977, the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church in Hong Kong drafted another agreement, titled The Pastoral Cooperation Agreement Between the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong Regarding Interfaith Marriages. This agreement relaxed restrictions on interfaith marriages between their members. Prior to this, the Catholic Church explicitly prohibited \"mixed marriages\" between Catholics and baptized non-Catholics. The agreement also stipulated that as long as a marriage was blessed by clergy from either side according to their respective church's regulations, it was considered sacred and valid. Weddings could be held in the church of either denomination.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) Exploring and Practicing Church Unity (Christian Weekly 1966, 1969, 1971b, 1971c, 1972b; Christian Echo 1969; John White 1969; Leung Yick Hin 2006)\n\n\nIn October 1975, the Chinese Methodist Church in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Wesleyan Church formally united to become The Methodist Church, Hong Kong, marking a groundbreaking chapter in the history of Chinese churches.\n\n\nThe Methodist and Wesleyan Churches had British and American roots, respectively. The former established its presence in Hong Kong in the 19th century, while the latter began its work in Hong Kong in the 1950s. Due to their shared denominational background, the Methodist and Wesleyan Churches in Hong Kong began cooperating closely from the 1950s. Their pastors formed the Joint Methodist Ministers Group as a platform for collaboration. In 1968, the two churches set up a Unity Dialogue Committee to discuss the possibility of union. By the end of the year, they published a position paper titled Why Unity?, which articulated the reasons for unity while acknowledging challenges, such as cooperation among pastors, concerns from church members, and a lack of understanding of the unity movement. \n\n\nIn January 1970, the two churches announced a preliminary agreement on unity. In July, a draft proposal outlined plans to name the unified church The Methodist Church, Hong Kong and adopt an episcopal system. Initially, the union retained Methodist and Wesleyan doctrines separately, with full integration planned within five years. By 1972, the Hong Kong Wesleyan Church achieved self-governance and financial independence. In June 1975, the British Methodist Conference approved the independence of the Hong Kong Methodist Church, and on October 25, 1975, the inaugural general assembly was held.\n\n\nNotably, discussions on church unity were not limited to the Methodist and Wesleyan Churches. The Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China and the Anglican Church in Hong Kong also exchanged views on broader unity. In 1966, the general secretary of the Hong Kong Council mentioned the possibility of forming a united church in Hong Kong. Subsequent discussions were held with the Methodist and Wesleyan Churches. In 1969, Peter Wong proposed establishing the United Church of Hong Kong, drafting a Principles for the Organization of the United Church of Hong Kong. However, the plan was shelved in July 1970.\n\n\nOn the Anglican side, the British Methodist Conference in 1965 passed a resolution by a large majority supporting closer ties with the Anglican Church. Subsequent discussions revealed that unity required 75% approval from both sides. The Methodists achieved 77% approval, but the Anglican clergy achieved only 69% in 1969. Despite this, Bishop John Gilbert Hind White expressed optimism about continuing discussions in Hong Kong. Representatives from both sides held further talks in October 1969, agreeing to form a consultation committee.\n\n\nIn 1971, the British Anglican Provincial Synod approved unity with the Methodist Church, but the decision required a final vote in February 1972. While the bishops secured 85% support, the clergy and lay representatives achieved only 65% and 62%, respectively.\n\n\nIn Hong Kong, a special session of the Wesleyan Church's annual conference in 1971, chaired by Bishop Lo Aito, invited representatives from the Anglican Church (Bishop White, read by Chen Zuocai), the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China (Peter Wong), the Methodist Church (Huang Zuo), and the English-speaking Methodist Church (K. G. Clarke) to discuss unity. All parties expressed support for unity in principle, but further details required discussion.\n\n\nDue to declining interest from the Hong Kong Council and the influence of failed unity efforts in Britain, only the Methodist and Wesleyan Churches successfully united in 1975.\n\n\nReverend Huang Zuo (Methodist) became the first president of the united church, and Reverend Leung Lam-hoi (Wesleyan) became its first general secretary. The English-speaking Methodist Church, originally part of the British Methodist Church, formally joined the united church as the English District in 1988, further advancing unity.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) The Public Sale of The Olive by the HKU Christian Association, 1975 (Leung Koon Ting, n.d.)\n\n\nThe Christian Association (CA) of the University of Hong Kong, established in 1953, launched its publication, The Olive, in 1960. Initially focused on news reporting as a fellowship bulletin, it underwent significant reform during the 1973–1974 academic year to become a pioneering magazine for tertiary students, seminarians, and church leaders. In 1975, The Olive was made available for public sale. \n\n\nThe mission of The Olive was to serve as \"a candid, bold, independent magazine unafraid to explore challenging issues; a public forum for intellectual Christian dialogue; and a bridge between the Hong Kong Church and university Christian students.\" \n\n\nDuring the 1970s, at the peak of student movements and amid strong ideological currents on campuses, Christian students faced challenges from non-Christian peers. The Olive tackled cutting-edge topics, such as the rational foundations of faith, social engagement, overseas missions, labor evangelism, Marxism, and Christianity, playing a pioneering role for the church of that era. However, the conservative and insular nature of Chinese churches often limited resonance with these topics, especially when discussions involved mainland China. The Olive's exploration of China and communism even led to suspicions of infiltration into the HKU Christian Association.\n\n\nDue to its provocative questioning of faith and the church, some clergy viewed The Olive as subversive, even banning it. Despite its niche audience, with peak sales of just over a thousand copies, The Olive served as a representative platform for diverse opinions. Many contributors—Christian student fellowship leaders and even polarized church leaders—participated in its discussions. It also became a cradle for talent, producing figures like Lee See-keung, Siu Sau-wah, and Chan Sai-kei, who later made significant contributions to the church and theological education.\n\n\nIn 1989, The Olive ceased publication after releasing its 58th issue, with editors lamenting, \"The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart,\" and \"The church does not need The Olive.\"\n\n(4)聖公會港澳教區與天主教香港教區簽訂聖洗協議 1974（教聲1974；傅俊濠 2018：106-107）\n\n\n1974年3月，聖公會港澳教區與天主教香港教區簽訂聖洗協議，重申雙方教會所施行的匯洗，無論儀式與傳統，皆以聖經中基督所設的聖洗為基礎。協議保證雙方的聖洗均屬有效，並應將聖洗登記於紀錄冊內，以備查詢。此協議象徵聖公會與天主教在追求「合一」方面的成果。\n\n\n出席簽署儀式的雙方代表：天主教香港教區代表李宏基主教、艾巧智（Secondo Einaudi））副主教、馬毅華（Edward F. Malone）神父、湯漢神父；聖公會港澳教區代表白約翰會督、張紹桂會吏長、張綠薌法政牧師、薛本德（Stephen Sidebotham）牧師。\n\n\n1977年，聖公會再與香港天主教擬定《聖公會港澳教區與天主教香港教區關於雙方信徒通婚牧靈（牧養）合作協議》，放寬雙方信徒通婚的規範。在此之前，天主教明文禁止天主教徒與領過洗的非天主教徒的「混合婚姻」。協議又容許只要雙方遵照任何一方牧者所依據所屬教會的法規而祝福的婚姻，均屬神聖而且有效，婚姻可在任何一方的教堂舉行。\n\n\n(5) 教會合一的探索與實踐（基督教週報 1966，1969，1971b，1971c，1972b；教聲1969；白約翰1969；梁逸軒2006）\n\n\n1975年10月，香港中華循道公會及香港衛理公會正式聯合，成為「香港基督教循道衛理聯合教會」（The Methodist Church, Hong Kong），在華人教會歷史上，寫下了劃時代的一頁。\n\n\n循道及衛理公會分屬英美背景，前者早於19世紀便在香港開基，而後者則延至1950年代始在香港發展。由於宗派背景相同，在香港的循道及衛理公會自1950年代開始，在各自發展之餘，兩會的牧師已成立循道衛理宗牧師聯合組織（Joint Methodist Ministers Group），建立緊密的交流合作平台。1968年，兩會開始就合一問題成立「合一會談委員會」作具體商討。是年底，出版《為甚麼要合一？》意見書，申論合一的原因，也不諱言其中存在的問題，包括牧師合作、教友顧忌及對合一運動了解不足等。1970年1月，兩會公佈就合一問題達成初步意向，後來在7月的〈芻議大鋼〉中，確定教會以「香港基督教循道衛理聯合教會」為名，教制為會長制。聯合初期分設循道、衛理教理，並於五年內實現聯合。1972年，香港衛理公會實現自治自養，1975年6月，英國循道會總議會通過香港循道公會獨立，最後在1975年10月25日，舉行創基總議會代表大會。\n\n\n值得留意的是，教會合一的討論，並非只局限在循道及衛理兩教派。中華基督教會香港區會及香港聖公會亦曾就擴大合一交換意見。中華基督教會方面，香港區會總幹事早於1966年曾提及在香港實現合一教會的可能。翌年，區會與循道及衛理開始就合一問題作交流討論。1969年，汪彼得再提及成立「香港聯合教會」（United Church of Hong Kong ） 的建議，並先後與聖公會、循道公會及衛理公會交流。6月，區會更草擬〈香港聯合教會組織原則草案〉。但在1970年7月，區會執委會決定擱置。\n\n\n聖公會方面，先是英國循道會於1965年總議會中，以大比數投票通過「我們是否需要與聖公會有密切的關係」，以及按此提議，「指示我們向前進的口徑」。此後，英國聖公會就合一問題作討論，根據雙方協議，雙方均須獲75%同意票方進行聯合。循道會方面結果有77%贊成合一，但聖公會聖品院在1969年卻只取得69%同意票。不過，香港聖公會白約翰會督卻表示，仍樂見香港聖公會與循道公會能在69年繼續商討合一。兩會代表亦於69年10月舉行座談會，並同意組織磋商委員會跟進聯合。\n\n\n1971年英國聖公會教省會議通過與英國循道公會合一。惟此決議，仍須於1972年2月再作最後投票，不過，最終主教院雖獲85%支持，但在聖品院及平信徒院，卻分別只獲65%及62% 支持。\n\n\n1971年，衛理公會年議會中，舉行特別討論會「教會合一在香港是否可行」，由衛理公會羅愛徒會督主持，邀請聖公會（白約翰會督，由陳佐才代宣讀）、中華基督教會香港區會（汪彼得）、循道公會（黃作）、英語循道公會（高克禮）就合一問題交流，大家均就原則上同意合一，方式及細節有待商討。\n\n\n由於中華基督教會香港區會對成立聯合教會的意見突趨冷淡，香港聖公會方面又因英國的合一不獲過，而影響到本地的商討，最後，只有循道及衛理兩公會在1975年實現聯合。\n\n\n黃作牧師（循道）為循道衛理聯合教會首任會長，梁林開牧師（衛理）為首任總議會書記。至於原本隸屬英國循道公會的循道公會英語堂，要到1988年才正式加入香港循道衛理會成為英語聯區，帶來進一步的合一成果。\n\n\n(6) 港大團契《橄欖》公開發售 1975（梁冠霆 n.d.）\n\n\n香港大學基督徒團契（Christian Association, CA）於1953年成立，並於1960年創辦《橄欖》，惟初期以消息報道為主，作為團訊之用。直至1973至1974年度，《橄欖》銳意革新，希望能成為一份屬於大專界、神學生與教會領袖的先鋒雜誌，1975年起公開發售。《橄欖》的宗旨是「一份直言、敢言、獨立、勇於探討難題的雜誌；一個作為基督徒知識份子思想交流的公開論壇；一度溝通香港教會與大專基督徒學生界的橋樑」。\n\n\n70年代《橄欖》雜誌的轉型，正值學運的高峯期，「關中認社」氣氛濃烈，校園充斥著意識形態，大專信徒需要面對來自非基督徒同儕的衝擊。《橄欖》探討的課題甚具前沿性，包括信仰的理性基礎、社會參與、海外差傳、勞工福音、馬克思主義與基督教，替那個時代的教會承擔了先鋒角色。可是，由於華人教會向來保守和內向，相關課題不但較難引起共鳴，當話題涉及中國大陸，更容易引來他們非議；70年代《橄欖》有關中國與共產主義的討論，就曾經惹來「港大團契遭滲透」的猜疑。由於《橄欖》對信仰以至教會的叩問不無顛覆性，部分教牧甚至視之為禁書，它終究只是一份小眾讀物，實際銷量最高時也只有千餘份。但作為一個容納多元意見的平台，《橄欖》卻很具代表性，因不少當年基督徒學生福音團契的同工，以至一些幾乎水火不容的教牧領袖，都曾在《橄欖》參與討論。這裏也是一個孕育人才的搖籃，當年曾經出現過的名字，有很多已成為今天為人熟悉的領袖對教會和神學教育貢獻良多（如李思敬、蕭壽華、陳士齊）。\n\n\n1989年，《橄欖》出版第58期後，宣佈「停刊」，編者慨嘆：「哀莫大於心死」、「教會不需要橄欖」。\n\n\n (7) Can Churches Accept Government Lotteries Fund Grants? (Wu Shengwu 1970; Ho Daozhang 1970; Yan Yongquan 1970; Christian Weekly 1984)\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, as the refugee problem in Hong Kong stabilized, overseas donations began to decrease. Many international welfare organizations reclassified Hong Kong as a non-emergency aid region. Consequently, most voluntary and religious organizations sought local funding, with government subsidies, the Lotteries Fund, and the Community Chest replacing overseas donations. The Lotteries Fund, established in 1965, was derived from gambling revenue. However, opinions within the church community differed on whether to accept such funds.\n\n\nIn 1970, Christian Weekly presented varying opinions on this issue. Reverend Wu Shengwu (Anglican Church) wrote about a 1969 plan by the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union to construct a new elderly home. The union requested construction funding from the government, and the Social Welfare Department suggested applying to the Lotteries Fund. In the union's spring conference in March 1970, members debated whether to apply and ultimately decided against it. Wu noted that the core question was whether the Lotteries Fund money was \"tainted.\" He reflected, \"The Lotteries Fund money is unclean, but is money from other government sources clean? Is gambling money the dirtiest? Are taxpayers clean? While gambling taxes may be unclean, what about money earned through usury, worker exploitation, bribery, or dishonest trade? Can the church guarantee that donations it receives are clean?\" Wu argued that the key issue was not whether the money was clean but rather how to use the available funds for the most meaningful purposes.\n\n\nWu's viewpoint was challenged by Reverend Ho Daozhang (Evangelical Free Church), who stated, \"Whether a donor's money is clean is a personal matter between them and God. But knowing that Lotteries Fund money comes from gambling, how can we stretch out our hands to take it?\" A believer later wrote that if the union accepted \"gambling money,\" it would amount to bowing to sin, tarnishing the church's sacred reputation and solemn stance. The believer further hypothesized that if the union accepted the Lotteries Fund, future elderly home residents might admonish their gambling-addicted descendants, only to hear, \"Isn’t your home funded by our gambling? Wouldn't it be better if I gambled more to build more elderly homes and help others?\"\n\n\nThe Christian Weekly discussion represented only the tip of the iceberg, as opinions within Hong Kong Christianity were divided between support and opposition.\n\n\nIn 1984, the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union petitioned the government, emphasizing that Christianity had always opposed gambling and could not apply for Lotteries Fund support for social services. They proposed the government establish a separate \"Social Welfare Development Fund\" for Christian organizations to apply.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (8) Does Accepting Government Subsidies for Schools Violate \"Separation of Church and State\"? (Christian Weekly 1971a; Du Zhaoxing 1970:3; Lau 2007)\n\n\nFrom the 1950s onward, to address the problem of many children lacking education, the government began subsidizing educational organizations under the Subsidized Code to establish subsidized schools. In developing new towns, the government also reserved land for organizations to apply for building subsidized schools. Hong Kong Christian organizations welcomed these subsidies to support education and evangelism, sharing the gospel with students in schools. However, the Hong Kong Baptist Convention adhered to the principle of \"separation of church and state\" and refused government subsidies, operating their schools as private institutions.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, debates arose within the Baptist community about accepting government subsidies for schools. Opposition came primarily from Southern Baptist Convention missionaries, who believed accepting subsidies violated the principle of separation of church and state. In contrast, Chinese members argued that accepting subsidies would help promote the faith without violating the principle. Du Zhaoxing, chair of the Elementary Education Department, stated, \"It is regrettable to lightly dismiss the principle of separation of church and state and neglect the opportunity to establish schools in densely populated residential areas, fostering the next generation with a Christian education.\"\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Baptist Convention established the First Baptist Church Primary School in Po On Village in 1958. When the school had to relocate due to road expansion, the government offered a newly constructed school building in Tsz Wan Shan for the convention to establish another school. This event reignited internal debates about government subsidies. In 1971, the convention decided to accept government subsidies \"indirectly.\" This indirect approach involved the convention allowing its staff from the Elementary Education Department and Secretariat to form an independent educational organization (financially independent and unrelated to the convention) to operate subsidized schools. Initially, the convention provided loans for the organization. In 1972, the Hong Kong Baptist Education Association was formally registered with the government. Under this arrangement, Pooi Oi Primary School in Tsz Wan Shan became the first Baptist school in Hong Kong to receive government subsidies. Convention chair Reverend Wong Yat-keung explained that while directly accepting subsidies for schools would violate the principle of separation of church and state, Christians forming independent organizations to run subsidized schools with church support would not conflict with Baptist beliefs.\n\n\nIn 1975, Pui Ching Middle School and Pui To Girls’ Secondary School transitioned to receiving government subsidies.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (9) The Revision of Hymns of Universal Praise, 1970–1977 (Gao Jie 1974)\n\n\nHymns of Universal Praise is a hymnbook used in worship by major denominations in Hong Kong. It was originally compiled in the 1920s by six major Christian denominations in China: the National Council of Churches of Christ in China, the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the North China Congregational Church, the East China Baptist Convention, and the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. In 1936, it was published by the Christian Literature Society in Shanghai as Hymns of Universal Praise. In 1955, the Christian Auxiliary Publishing House in Hong Kong (renamed the Christian Communications Ltd. in 1965) reprinted it.\n\n\nIn 1969, Christian Communications Ltd. solicited opinions from denominations using the hymnbook. After receiving support, it decided to proceed with revisions. The following year, its director, Huang Yongxi, formed a consultative committee and hired Mr. Wei Hanzhang to assist with revisions and song collection. The consultative committee consisted of two representatives from five denominations: the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China, the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau, the Chinese Methodist Church, the Methodist Church, and the Swatow Baptist Church. A quarter of the funding came from a British Christian literature organization, while the remaining three-quarters relied on donations from Hong Kong churches and Chinese churches in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nThe revision aimed to address several issues: some hymns were suitable only for specific contexts and not for international use; the 1936 edition’s language was more elegant and classical, necessitating simpler and more accessible wording; and some translations significantly diverged from the original meaning. The principles for revision included (1) comparing with the original text and (2) balancing simplicity and literary value. Initially planned to take three years, the revision was finally completed and published in December 1977.\n\n(7) 教會可否接受政府獎券基金資助（吳繩武1970；何道彰1970；甄永全1970；基督教週報1984）\n\n\n六十年代末期，由於香港的難民問題漸趨穩定，海外捐款漸呈減縮趨勢。許多國際性福利機構開始把香港評估成非接受緊急援助地區。在此情況下，大部分志願及宗教團體轉而尋找本地資助。其中，政府津貼、獎券基金及公益金乃取代海外捐款的地位。政府獎券基金（Lotteries Fund）成立於1965年，乃政府從博彩收益而來的助款。不過，教會界對於是否接受亦持有不同意見。\n\n\n1970年的《基督教週報》就此問題曾有不同意見。先是吳繩武牧師（聖公會）撰文，指1969年，香港華人基督教聯會計劃興建新老人院，要求政府撥助建築費，社會福利署回覆可向獎券基金申請。聯會在1970年3月的春季議事會上，就是否申請作出討論，最後決定不予申請。他指出，會議討論的重點，是「獎券基金」是否「『不乾淨』的錢」？不過，他卻反思：「獎券基金的錢是不乾淨的，但接受政府其他來源的錢，就乾淨嗎？博彩的錢是不是最骯髒的？」「納稅人乾不乾淨？博彩稅的錢固然不乾淨，但放高利貸、剝削工人、賄賂舞弊、做不誠實賣買的錢，何曾是乾淨的呢？退一步來看，教會經常所收的捐款，可以保證乾淨嗎？」吳以為，重點不是是否接受不乾淨的錢，「而在於怎樣調遣我們所拿得到的錢，用在最有價值的事上」。不過，吳的觀點隨即被何道彰牧師（播道會）反駁，指「捐款人的錢乾淨與否，是其個人對神負責。但獎券基金我們明知是賭博性質的錢……又怎好伸出我們的手呢？」未幾，有信徒撰文，指「聯會一旦接受『賭款』，這無疑是向罪惡低頭，神聖的聲譽，嚴肅的立場，會因此一掃淨盡」。他更假設聯會接受了獎券基金，日後有位住院老人規勸沉迷賭博的兒孫時，兒孫即以「你們起居的不就是靠我們賭博才能建造起來嗎？」「我多博幾口不就是多幾個錢來多建幾所老人院，造福多些還不好嗎？」\n\n\n《基督教週報》的討論，無疑是冰山一角，香港基督教內就此問題，出現支持與反對兩種意見。\n\n\n1984年，香港華人基督教聯會向政府上書，指基督教一向反對賭博，無法申請獎券基金來支持社會服務，希望政府另設「社會福利發展基金」，以便基督教團體申請。\n\n\n(8) 接受政府津貼辦學是否違反「政教分離」？（基督教週報1971a；杜照星1970：3；Lau 2007）\n\n\n50年代以降，為解決大量失學兒童問題，政府開始按津貼條例（Subsidized Code）資助辦學團體辦學，稱為津貼學校。政府在發展徒置新區時，也會預留土地供辦學團體申請，籌辦津貼學校。香港基督教團體樂於接受政府津貼，藉興學宣教，在校內向學生傳講福音。不過，香港浸信會以「政教分離」（seperation of church and state）為原則而拒絕接受政府津貼，故此興辦學校，均為私立營運。\n\n\n60年代，浸信會內部對接受政府津貼辨學，出現不同意見。持反對意見者，主要是美南浸信會差會的傳教士，認為此舉有違政教分離原則。相對而言，華人卻認為接受津貼辦學，有助傳教，毋違政教分離。其中初等教育部主席杜照星，便指「初輕描淡寫『政教分離』的原則下，而忽略在這些人口最集中的住宅區去辦學，去培養下一代受到基督化的教育，這實在是件惋惜的事」。\n\n\n香港浸聯會在博愛村內創立的香港浸信聯會第一小學（1958）年，因政府擴建道路而要拆遷，政府答允將慈雲山新區已建好之校舍供浸聯會另辦學校。事件迫使浸聯會內部再次就是否接受政府津貼問題展開討論。1971年，浸聯會決定以「間接方式」接受政府資助興辦教育事業。所謂間接方式，是由浸聯會准許其中等初等教育部及幹事部人員參加組織一個獨立的教育機構（與浸聯會無關，財政完全獨立）去開辦津貼學校。在開辦初期，則由浸聯會貸款予該機構運作。1972年「香港浸信教育協會」正式向政府註冊。在此安排下，慈雲山培愛小學成為香港浸信會第一間接受政府津貼的學校。浸聯會主席黃日強牧師指：如果直接接受政府津貼去辦學校，是違反政教分離的原則。「但是，基督徒個人的組合，或是獲得教會贊助的超然組織，辦理津貼學校，對浸會信仰是沒有衝突的」。\n\n\n1975年，培正中學及培道女子中學轉為接受政府津貼。\n\n\n(9) 重修《普天頌讚》1970-1977（高潔1974）\n\n\n《普天頌讚》是香港主要宗派崇拜時使用的詩歌集。《普天頌讚》是1920年代，中國基督教六大公會（中華基督教會全國總會、中華聖公會、美以美會、華北公理會、華東浸禮會及監理會）聯合編修的詩歌集。1936年，由上海廣學會出版《頌天頌讚》。1955年，基督教輔僑出版社（1965年易名基督教文藝出版社）在港再版《普天頌讚》。\n\n\n1969年，基督教文藝出版社首先向採用這本詩集的各宗派徵求意見，得各教會支持後便敲定重編工作。翌年，社長黃永熙組織諮詢委員會，聘請韋瀚章先生協助修訂工作，以及開始徵求詩歌。諮詢委員會是由五個宗派：中華基督教會香港區會、聖公會港澳教區、中華基督教循道公會、衞理公會及潮語浸信會，各派兩個代表組織而成。其中四分之一的經費，是英國基督教文字機構資助，其餘四分之三希望由香港教會，及東南亞地區的華人教會捐助。\n\n\n重編《普天頌讚》的原因，是詩集內若干詩歌，乃當時特殊適用的詩歌，並不適宜海外教會的背景。加上1936年版本用詞較文雅及文言化，因此有需要改為淺白詞句。再者，部分譯文與原文的意思差別太大，因此必須進行重編工作。修改的原則包括：（1）對照原文；（2）既淺白通俗，又不失其文學上的價值。按最初計劃，重編需時3年，但最後卻於1977年12月始正式面世。\n\n\n\n\n 1. The \"Sinned Against\" Theology (Fung 1980; Fung Wai-man 2014: 70–79)  \n\n\nThe theological concept of the \"Sinned Against,\" proposed by Fung Wai-man (1940–), the Director of the Christian Industrial Committee (1969–1979), emerged from his reflections on faith during his involvement in labor movements. After leaving the Committee in 1979, Fung served as the Mission Secretary of the Hong Kong Christian Council. In 1981, he was invited by the World Council of Churches (WCC) to become the Secretary for Evangelism for the Commission on World Mission and Evangelism (CWME) in Geneva, Switzerland. In July 1980, he published an article titled \"Compassion for the Sinned Against\" in the journal Theology Today at Princeton Theological Seminary, first introducing this concept during a WCC seminar in 1979.\n\n\nFung noted that Christianity often emphasizes humans as sinners rebelling against God, requiring repentance. The idea of the \"Sinned Against,\" however, highlights that humans are not only sinners but also victims of sin. The \"sin\" he referred to includes the evil forces wielded by those in power and other systemic injustices permeating human life and institutions. Fung argued, \"A gospel message that lacks the notion of people being sinned against will have no relevance to those who have suffered violations.\"  \n\n\nHe further explained that viewing people only as sinners might elicit care and sympathy but lacks the element of true compassion—\"a shared concern and solidarity.\" Evangelism, he argued, cannot bypass confronting the forces of oppression or offer ready-made solutions to eliminate them. Instead, the gospel must demystify these forces, enabling the \"sinned against\" to understand, confront, and grasp their own culpability amidst these forces.\n\n\nAfter returning to Hong Kong in 1991, Fung served as the Senior Executive Secretary of the Christian Institute.\n\n\n---\n\n\n 2. The Evangelical Debate on Social Concerns (1984)  \n\n\nOn March 16, 1984, the Social Concerns Group of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Christian Fellowship invited Rev. Teng Kin-fai, Senior Pastor of North Point Alliance Church, and Rev. Chang Mok-ai, President of Alliance Bible Seminary, to the seminar Rethinking Social Concerns. This event followed articles by both pastors in November 1983, which sparked debates among Christian university students regarding the relationship between evangelism and social engagement. Olive, a publication of the Hong Kong University Fellowship, described their perspectives as representing evangelical thought: prioritizing evangelism over social concerns. Similarly, Cry Out, a magazine run by young Christian intellectuals and students, published an article in January 1984 expressing dissatisfaction with their stance. This led to the seminar, where the pastors engaged with students on the issue.\n\n\nAt the seminar, Rev. Teng expanded on his position that \"evangelism is primary, and social concerns are secondary.\" He introduced the concepts of the Life Mission (concerning salvation within God's kingdom) as the \"core mission\" (Mission Proper) and the Radiation Mission (extending God's glory through believers to society). While inseparable, these missions have an \"intrinsic order,\" with salvation taking precedence. He also introduced the concept of the \"Shadow Kingdom,\" which reflects God's justice and love but is distinct from the eternal \"Kingdom of God.\" The church's mission, he argued, should prioritize establishing the eternal kingdom before addressing the temporary \"Shadow Kingdom.\" \n\n\nRev. Chang outlined various evangelical stances on social engagement:\n\n1. Holistic Evangelism: Evangelism and social concerns are inseparable.\n\n2. Classical Mission View: Evangelism is the church's sole mission; societal change is a byproduct of evangelism and personal transformation.\n\n3. Holistic Mission: While evangelism takes precedence, social concerns are important but secondary.  \n\n\nChang emphasized that the church's primary responsibility is fulfilling the Great Commission through evangelism, with social engagement focusing on service-oriented activities. Full-person care should prioritize spiritual needs.\n\n\nThe seminar prompted extensive questions from students, primarily regarding the prioritization of evangelism over social engagement. Rev. Teng reiterated that expanding the redeemed community necessitates prioritizing evangelism, warning against social concerns overshadowing evangelism, which could lead to the church's decline. Citing examples from American churches overly focused on social reform at the expense of evangelism, he warned of diminishing congregations and influence. While social achievements in the \"Shadow Kingdom\" are commendable, they must not hinder people from joining the \"Redeemed Community.\"  \n\n\nRev. Chang also clarified that social organizations like hospitals or counseling services should focus on their respective missions, while the church should prioritize evangelism and spiritual care. Christians, he suggested, could participate in social actions as individuals or through organizations, adhering to the principle of separating church and state.\n\n(1)被罪者（Sinned Against）1980（Fung 1980；馮煒文2014：70-79）\n\n\n「被罪者」的神學觀念，由基督教工業委員會主任（1969-1979）馮煒文（1940-）提出，主要源自他投身工運時的信仰反省。馮在1979年他離開工委會後，先於香港基督教協進會任宣教幹事，隨後在1981年接受普世教會協會邀請，前往瑞士日內瓦出任世界宣教佈道委員會（Commission on World Mission and Evangelism, CWME）佈道幹事（secretary for evangelism）。1979年，他在普世教會協會的研討會上提出，1980年7月，以 “Compassion for the Sinned Against”為題發表於普林斯頓神學院期刊Theology Today上。\n\n\n馮指出，基督教常強調人是叛逆上帝的罪人，需要悔改。但「被罪者」的觀念卻提醒我們，人不僅是罪人，也是「被罪惡所犯」。他指的「罪惡」，包括世上掌權者及有勢力的、各類的罪惡力量，這些力量滲入人類的生活及組織。「一個福音信息如果缺乏人是被侵犯的觀念，是不會對那曾被侵犯的人有意義的」。「如果我們看人是罪人（而非「被罪者」），我們可能會對他們關懷、愛護、同情，但卻缺少了憐憫，一份「患難與共，關懷扶持」的憐憫」。因此，傳福音「不能挪開那些侵犯我們的罪惡勢力，也不能提供任何預備好的方案來把它消滅。福音是要除去那罪惡勢力的神話色彩，使『被罪者』能了解它，掌握它，並在這勢力當中了解自己的罪惡」。\n\n\n馮煒文在1991年回港後，出任基督徒學會高級執行幹事。\n\n\n(2) 福音派與社關的爭論 1984（港大團契1984：22-31；邢福增2018：141-142，170-175）\n\n\n1984年3月16日，中大團契社關小組邀請宣道會北角堂主任滕近輝牧師及建道神學院張慕皚院長出席「社會關懷再思」研討會。研討會的背景，是兩人在1983年11月，分別撰文闡述關於基督徒與社關的問題，其立論引起大專基督徒的關注。香港大學團契出版的《橄欖》編者，形容「兩位福音派教會的代表人物不約而同地認為應以傳福音為主為先，社關為副為後，彷彿就成了福音派對社關的立場宣言」。另一份由青年基督徒知識分子及學生創辦的刊物《吶喊》，也在1984年1月號發表了三位讀者（以斯拉、約拿、亞倫）合撰的文章，對滕、張二人將傳福音置於社關之上的觀點表達不滿。於是，中大團契便特別主辦研討會，邀請兩人與學生對話。\n\n\n滕近輝在中大團契研討會上，進一步闡釋關於「傳福音為主，社會關懷為副」的立場。首先，他提出「生命性的使命」（Life Mission）與「放射性的使命」（Radiation concept of Mission）的概念，前者是關乎在神的國度中拯救人的問題，這是「使命的主體」（Mission Proper）。隨著得救人數的擴大，「這班人會自然地把神的榮耀從他們身上放射到其所處的社會中去」。他強調，這不是「二分法」，而是「Life Mission與Radiation 合成教會的總使命，彰顯神的榮耀」。兩者的關係既「不可分割」，但卻「有必然的先後次序（Intrinsic Order）」。其次，他提出「影子神國」（Shadow Kingdom）的概念。「神國」是神從世界中救贖出來的群體，而「影子神國」，則由「神形像的餘留」及「基督教文明」所構成，並形成「影子國度」（the Reflected Kingdom of God）。「影子國度」在「國度」之外，有神的公義和慈愛在其中。教會的使命首先是建立永恆的「國度」（得救群體），其次是建立暫時的「影子國度」。因此，「所以要將教會的貢獻擴大，必須先使救贖的群體增加。」傳福音是主，社關是副，並不是二元論的「機械性（mechanical）的次序」，而是「有機性（organic）的次序」。\n\n\n張慕皚在中大團契研討會上，疏理了福音派對社關的不同立場，包括（1）整全福音事工（Holistic Evangelism）：傳福音與社關不可分割；（2）傳統純福音主義（Classical View of Mission）：教會獨一使命是傳福音，而社會改變是傳福音和個人生命改變的副產品；（3）整全的差傳事工（Holistic Mission）：傳福音與社關並非同等重要，前者應被視為教會首要和優先的責任，同而社關也不等同傳福音。他指出，教會應以完成傳福音的大使命為首要任務，而把社會參與集中在社會服務性的工作上。教會重視全人關懷，使全人關懷應以照顧靈性需要為主。\n\n\n滕、張兩人分別講述後，引發了在座不少大專基督徒的提問。其中不少仍是涉及傳福音與社關的先後次序問題。滕牧師再次解釋他的立場，「我們要令社會關懷的影響繼續擴大，我們必須將得救的群體擴大，如要擴大這個群體，必須先傳福音」。相反，若以社會關懷為主，「喧賓奪主」，教會便有「收縮」的危機。他舉美國一些積極參與社會改革，卻忽略傳福音的教會為例，「這些宗派的基督徒的人數越來越少，影響也越來越少，教會對整個世界沒有決定性的作用。質言之，「影子國度」雖有成就，但卻「攔阻了加入這個Redeemed Community」，「聖經的價值就是如果最好的東西攔阻人得救，這個東西在神永恆的Evaluation裡就是負數」。滕牧師重申，「福音派的信仰並非不注重社會關懷」，但需要有「Concrete Programme」，這樣教會才能響應。他呼籲福音派教會成立研究關於教會參與社關的部門，「研究那些是我們應做的，那些是我們不應該做的」。\n\n\n張慕皚回應主次關係時，以靈實醫院及突破為例，指其主力集中在醫治及輔導等工作，而非傳福音。因此，教會便應以傳福音及屬靈關顧為主，容許及支持其他機構做好社會關懷。至於涉及社會行動，信徒應以個人身份參與，或透過機構參與，以確立政教分離的原則。\n\n\n (3) Theological Discourses on 1997  \n\n\nThe 1997 sovereignty handover of Hong Kong sparked discussions within local churches about their role and response. The ecumenical Christian Council (HKCC) took the lead, publishing Hong Kong Churches and the Future of Hong Kong in November 1982. This work included perspectives from both ecumenical and evangelical figures, exploring 1997 from biblical, theological, local church, and young Christian viewpoints. The Public Policy Committee of HKCC affirmed that Hong Kong’s sovereignty rightly belongs to China. It also identified challenges for the church, including contextualizing theology, fostering self-reliance within churches, redefining church-community relationships, and cultivating national consciousness (HKCC 1982).  \n\n\nOn November 23, 1982, a seminar titled Hong Kong Churches and the Future of Hong Kong was held at Tao Fong Shan, featuring Rev. Lam Yu-Sing (Anglican Church), Rev. Lee Ching-Tsz (Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China), and Rev. Lo Lung-Kwong (Methodist Church). Rev. Lam stressed the need to focus on the 98% of society’s lower classes rather than those planning to emigrate. He called on churches to provide stability through pastoral care, biblical teaching, and theological reflection. Rev. Lee proposed the \"Three Nos\" approach: avoiding untruthful comforting words, not believing that crises signify the end times, and not clinging to false hope. Rev. Lo urged churches to take the opportunity to reflect on their essence and mission (Catholic Youth Federation 1983: 107–115).  \n\n\nThe Divinity School of Chung Chi College, Chinese University of Hong Kong, also addressed 1997 through its Outspoken Series, publishing works such as 1997 and Hong Kong Theology (1983), Abundant Gospel: Reflections Triggered by 1997 (1984), Christians and Politics (1985), and Citizens and Civic Education (1987).  \n\n\nEvangelicals also actively engaged with the topic. The Hong Kong Student Evangelical Fellowship published 1997: Change and Renewal (1983) and its expanded edition (1984). In the preface, Tat-Sum Yu emphasized the need for churches to systematically explore the implications of 1997 from the perspective of their nature and mission (Yu 1983). The Christian Witness Theological Association also released a series of publications, including 1997 and the Mission of the Church (1984), The Practice of Social Concern (1984), The Three-Self Church and the Future of Hong Kong Churches (1984), A Biblical Perspective on Human Rights, Freedom, Democracy, and Rule of Law (1985), The Church’s Path (1986), The Basic Law and Religious Policies (1986), and Church-State Perspectives (1987). These books, often based on seminars, addressed theological reflections, church missions, the Three-Self Church, church-state relations, and religious policies within the context of 1997.\n\n\nWendell P. Karsen, a missionary from the Reformed Church in America, noted that even among evangelicals, discussions on 1997 reflected a newfound social consciousness. He quoted Lam Chak of HKCC, who described the Christian Witness Theological Association as representing \"the radical politicization of Hong Kong’s evangelicals,\" spurred by concerns over religious freedom post-1997 (Karsen 2020: 191). This social awakening was evident among both evangelicals and ecumenicals.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (4) The HKCC Directional Disputes (1986–1987)  \n\n\nThe HKCC, comprising various denominations and Christian organizations, faced internal conflicts over its political stance in the mid-1980s. Rev. Kwok Nai-Ho, who served as General Secretary from 1978, advocated for the church's active engagement in Hong Kong’s socio-political development. Kwok later reflected that his initiatives raised concerns among mainland Chinese authorities and led some church leaders to caution him against pursuing actions lacking broad consensus within Hong Kong’s churches.\n\n\nBy 1986, two opposing views emerged within HKCC:\n\n1. Some church leaders advocated for churches to align with or submit to governing authorities.\n\n2. Others, represented by Kwok, argued for maintaining a critical distance from authorities, intervening when necessary.  \n\n\nAt the HKCC’s annual meeting in September 1986, a reshuffle of the Executive Committee shifted its stance. According to Kwok, influential church leaders stopped nominating key contributors who supported his approach, such as Rev. Lee Chi-Cheung and Rev. Wu Ping-Kit from the Methodist Church and Anglican leaders like Canon Anthony Chan, Rev. Tsang Kei-Choi, and Rev. Chan Yin-Cheong. These changes resulted in a more conservative leadership, with Ms. Chiu-Wa Ko from the YWCA replacing the politically neutral Leung Lam-Hoi as Chairperson.\n\n\nThe new Executive Committee imposed stricter oversight, requiring all committee decisions to be approved by the Executive Committee before implementation. This significantly impacted the Public Policy Committee, established in 1981 to address social issues. Key initiatives were delayed or vetoed, including responding to Shum Wai-Sze's article on the Basic Law and religious freedom. Even seminar speaker lists required approval, and special committee members were restricted to those from HKCC-member congregations.\n\n\nIn September 1987, Public Policy Committee members, including Chairman Yu Tin-Yau, submitted a joint statement criticizing the Executive Committee for obstructing their initiatives, accusing HKCC of abandoning its responsibility to shape Hong Kong’s future and fulfill its prophetic role in society. This disagreement led to collective resignations from the committee and Kwok Nai-Ho stepping down as General Secretary in September 1988.\n\n\nJournalist Emily Lau reported in the Far Eastern Economic Review in December 1987 (later republished in Ming Pao), describing a growing divide between conservative and progressive factions in Hong Kong’s mainstream churches. She criticized certain church leaders for allegedly yielding to Beijing's influence. Leung Lam-Hoi acknowledged in the article that the new leadership sought to avoid transforming HKCC into an oppositional pressure group. He remarked, \"1997 hasn’t arrived yet, but some in Hong Kong are already dictating what can or cannot be done.\"\n\n(3) 九七神學論述\n\n\n隨著香港九七前途問題的出現，激發香港教會對九七的回應。在普世派方面，基督教協進會的公共政策委員會，率先於1982年11月，出版《香港教會與香港前途》一書，匯集了普世派及福音派人士，從聖經、神學、地方教會及青年基督徒的角度作探討。公共政策委員會也表明立場：認定香港作為中國的一部分，香港主權屬於中國是理所當然的。委員會又指出，九七正好對香港教會作出挑戰，特別是如何致力於神學的本色化及處境化，及教會如何自立的問題。同時，教會與社區的關係，以及建立國民意識，也是未來要反省及實踐的（基督教協進會1982）。\n\n\n1982年11月23日，道風山舉辦了「香港教會與香港前途教牧同工研討會」，由聖公會林汝升牧師、中華基督教會李清詞牧師及循道衛理會盧龍光牧師主講。林強調，教會要將關心重點放在98%中下層人士身上，而非那些將要離港的人。教會應在牧養、聖經及神學上安定人心。李則提出「三不」，即不說自己也不相信的安慰話，不應認為危急關頭，世界末日將至，以及為希望求存。盧則呼籲教會值此機會重新反省其本質與使命（天主教青年聯會1983：107-115）。\n\n\n此外，中文大學崇基神學組也出版「吐露叢書」作回應：《1997與香港神學》（1983）、《豐盛的福音：從九七所引發的反省》（1984）、《基督徒與政治》（1985）、《公民與公民教育》（1987）。\n\n\n除普世派外，福音派方面也積極探索，例如香港學生福音團契先後出版《1997：轉變與更新》（1983）及《1997：轉變與更新（增訂本）》（1984）。余達心在〈序〉中指出，教會需要有組織地去探討九七各種含意，從教會的本質與使命角度來看九七（余達心1983）。而福音證主協會更出版一系列的「正視集」：《1997與教會使命》（1984）、《社會關懷的實踐》（1984）、《三自與香港教會前景》（1984）、《從聖經看人權自由民主法制》（1985）、《教會前路》（1986）、《基本法與宗教政策》（1986）、《政教縱橫》（1987）。上述書籍，主要是由福音證主協會舉的研討會結集出版，內容不僅涉及香港教會的使命及神學反思，也包括對三自教會及政教關係、宗教政策，以及基本法的探討。\n\n\n美國歸正教會派駐香港的傳教士嘉偉德（Wendell P. Karsen），曾引述基督教協進會的林澤形容福音證主協會代表「香港福音派激進地政治化」（radical politicization of HK’s evangelicals）：「為甚麼他們突然變得這麼具社會意識(social conscious)？……答案是因為1997這令人生畏的年份快將臨到，而它會威脅到宗教的自由」（嘉偉德2020：191）。相信這不僅適用於福音派，也同樣可對應在普世派傳統。\n\n\n(4) 協進會路線之爭 1986-1987（邢福增2018：210-212）\n\n\n基督教協進會由香港不同的宗派及基督教團體組成，各會員教會及團體選派代表組成執委會。郭乃弘牧師自1978年起擔任總幹事，在其帶領下，協進會積極關注香港社會及政治的發展。郭在回憶錄中指出，其工作引起中方憂慮，並有香港教會領袖跟他表達：「他善意勸告我，我不當做香港教會沒有共識的事」。1986年開始，協進會出現兩種對立意見：（1）部分會員教會領袖認為教會「當依附甚至順服政權」；（2）以郭乃弘為代表的路線，認為教會「當與政權保持距離，並在有需要時對政權進行批判」。\n\n\n1986年9月協進會舉行周年大會，並改選執委會。由於個別宗派委派的人選有所改變，導致執委立場出現變化。據郭乃弘指出：「幾位教會領袖……停止繼續委派對協進會有貢獻但被視為支持我的教牧同工，如區會的李熾昌牧師、胡丙杰牧師和聖公會的陳佐才法政牧師、曾繼才牧師、陳衍昌牧師等分別代表區會和聖公會出席協進會並成為協進會的執委。」而執委會主席由也由基督教女青年會的高苕華出任，取代了政治中立的梁林開。協進會的改選事件，引起傳媒及學者廣泛關注，形容為保守勢力的冒起。\n\n\n新一屆的執委及領導層，主導了協進會的路線。1987年2月25日，執委就協進會路線召開座談會，出現了兩種不同意見，一是主張協進會工作不應涉及政治敏感問題，二是要適切回應不變轉變社會的需要。後來，執委會改變管理模式，由「授權」（delegation）改為「管束」（control），要求各委員會須獲執委同意才能進行各項工作。郭乃弘指出，此舉明顯是要針對公共政策委員會。\n\n\n協進會公共政策委員會早於1981年成立，在不同社會議題上積極表達意見。郭氏提及的管束管理，即1987年新一屆執委，要求各委員會工作，須獲執委會通過才能進行，結果公共政策委員會不少決定，因執委無法即時通過而擱置。此外，執委會於5月否決公共政策委員會在2月提出回應辛維思〈基本法與宗教自由〉一文的動議。甚至連委員會主辦研討會邀請講員名單，也要獲執委通過；又限制各委員會的特約委員所屬堂會須為協進會會員。\n\n\n1987年9月，公共政策委員會由主席袁天佑，連同陳立僑、陸漢思、黃永生、馮智活、郭達潮等成員，向協進會成員教會代表發出聲明，批評執委會「屢次拒絕或拖延討論本委員會提出的議案……令委員會事工無法推展」。聲明又指出，協進會處於香港的關鍵時刻，「失卻了對塑造香港未來政制的承擔，及教會作為社會先驅者的角色，不但是推卸了上帝交付的時代使命，實亦是倒退的做法」。由於協進會執委與公共政策委員會就關注社會的立場及行動在了解上無法一致，導致委員會委員的集體辭職。郭乃弘亦於1988年9月離任。\n\n\n時任新聞工作者的劉慧卿於1987年12月23日在Far Eastern Economic Review以英文發表“ ‘An Unholy Alliance’: Protestant Liberals Accuse Leaders of Bowing to Peking”一文（ 1988年1月4日於《明報》再發表〈基督教會的非神聖同盟〉），指香港主流教會出現保守派與開明派的政治分化，並點名批評個別教會領袖聽從北京的意見。梁林開接受劉氏訪問時，承認「現在的協進會執委會不希望該會變成與當局對抗的壓力團體」，教會存在「無形壓力」，「一九九七年還未到，但香港有些人已在規定甚麼可以或不可以做。」\n\n\n (5) The Controversy Over Decriminalizing Homosexuality in 1988  \n\n\nIn June 1988, the Hong Kong government released a consultation document titled Should the Laws on Homosexual Offenses Be Revised?, presenting three options for public consideration:  \n\n1. Retain the existing laws without changes.  \n\n2. Decriminalize consensual private homosexual acts between two men, applicable only to males aged 21 and above.  \n\n3. Reduce penalties for consensual private homosexual acts between adults, lowering the maximum sentence from life imprisonment to a fine of HK$5,000 and one year of imprisonment. Additionally, gross indecency offenses would see penalties reduced from two years’ imprisonment to a fine of HK$2,000 and three months’ imprisonment.  \n\n\nThe Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union, at its July board meeting, resolved to oppose any changes to the laws and established a task force to monitor developments. In September 1988, they released a position paper reiterating that homosexual behavior was \"contrary to truth, nature, psychology, and physiology, harming families and society.\" They advocated for stricter penalties and associated homosexuality with the spread of AIDS.  \n\n\nIn August, the Christian Industrial Committee hosted a seminar featuring Catholic Father Franco Mella, Anglican Rev. Philip Wickeri, Professor Albert Chen from the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Law, and clinical psychologist Tsang Ka-Tat, who all supported decriminalization on the grounds of personal freedom. However, Dr. Yuen-Wan Choi of the Breakthrough Organization strongly opposed the decriminalization, founding the Joint Committee on the Legal Reform of Homosexuality. Choi published A Perspective on Homosexuality, arguing that homosexuality was a psychological disorder requiring treatment and criticizing the Law Reform Commission for ignoring public opinion, public health, and social morality. Evangelical Pastor Stephen Su from Evangelical Free Church of China Yan Fook Church took a biblical stance, condemning homosexuality as a violation of divine law, \"shameful,\" and \"abominable\" in God's eyes.  \n\n\nIn October, groups including the Hong Kong Christian Students Movement, Hong Kong Women Christian Council, Christian Industrial Committee, and several community churches issued a joint statement. They opposed criminalizing individuals' private lives, asserting that laws should not govern morality. They expressed hope for a society that upholds human rights, freedom, and diversity, emphasizing that Christians should not impose their faith on non-believers through legislation. They also highlighted the broader social implications of decriminalization on Hong Kong’s future societal model.\n\n\nIn 1991, the law decriminalizing homosexuality was passed, with only six votes against.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) The Debate Over Christian Migration  \n\n\nThe emigration wave of the 1980s significantly impacted Hong Kong churches. A 1990 survey by Hong Kong Evangelical 2000 indicated that 2.1% of church members emigrated, compared to 1% of the general population. The migration of pastoral staff was particularly notable; statistics show that between 1982 and 1997, at least 2,000 active pastors emigrated.  \n\n\nSome pastors left under the guise of pursuing further studies, often with financial support from their churches, only to resign afterward, which disrupted their congregations. Hasty departures by pastors and church members sometimes damaged relationships within the faith community. In some cases, pastors rationalized their emigration with theological justifications, creating tensions between the notions of \"staying in God’s will\" (主留) and \"leaving in God’s will\" (主溜).  \n\n\nIn 1988, the China Graduate School of Theology hosted a seminar on this topic, later compiled into a publication titled To Stay or To Leave (1989). The migration trend sparked debates over the ethical and spiritual responsibilities of Christians and church leaders amidst the uncertainty of Hong Kong's future.  \n\n(5) 同性戀非刑事化爭議1988（聯會1988；中國與教會1988；時代論壇1988；蘇穎智1988a,1988b）\n\n\n1988年6月，政府推出諮詢文件《有關同性戀罪行的法律應否修改？》，文件中列出三個意見給市民選擇：（1）與當時行使法律一樣不變；（2兩名男子同意而私下進行的同性性行為活動，可以非刑事化，不過法律項目建議只適用於21歲以上的男性；（3）對彼此同意而私下進行同性性行為的成年人，減輕刑罰，即由最高刑罰終身監禁減為罰款五千元兼監禁一年。另外， 粗獷性行為由監禁兩年改為罰款二千元兼監禁三個月。\n\n\n香港華人基督教聯會於7月的董事會上，通過堅持同性戀法律不變，並成立專責小組跟進，1988年9月發表立場書，重申同性戀行為「有悖真理，違反自然，心理生理，殃及家人，影響社會」，應加重刑責。同時，也指同性戀有助傳播愛滋病。\n\n\n8月，教會工作者協會主辦研討會，天主教夏其龍神父、聖公會馮智活牧師及港大法律系陳文敏、臨床心理學家曾家達均以不應干涉人身自由而支持非刑事化。不過，「突破」 機構蔡元雲醫生強烈反對同性戀非刑事化，他成立「各界關注同性戀法例聯合委員會」，出版《同性戀透視》一書，認為同性戀是一種心理疾病，需要接受治療，並批評香港法律改革委員會漠視民意、公共衛生及社會道德。播道會恩福堂蘇穎智牧師，則從聖經的角度，指同性戀違反了神創造之律，且是「可恥」的行為，為神所「憎惡」。\n\n\n10月，香港基督教學生運動、香港婦女基督徒協會、教會工作者協會、朋輩神學團契、基督教工業委員會、深愛堂社關團契、官塘社區教會及西九龍社區教會聯合發表聲明，認為不應隨便定人以罪，並指法律難以處理私德，反對利用法律控制人的道德。盼望香港可以保障人權，成為自由進步和多元化的社會。基督徒不應利用法律將自己的信仰強加於非教徒身上。他們認為，同性戀能否非刑事化，不單影響同性戀者，對香港未來社會型態的發展，也有重大影響。\n\n\n1991年，有關非刑事化的法例，最終在只有6票反對下通過。\n\n\n(6) 基督徒及教牧移民之爭議（梁家麟1993：68-78；梁家麟2002：67-73；香港福音二千1991：35-38；吳羅瑜、許志賢1989）\n\n\n80年代香港的移民潮也對香港教會帶來衝擊。香港福音二千在1990年進行的調查，指信徒移民佔信徒人口比例2.1%，比香港移民佔人口比例的1%高。其中教牧同工移民的情況亦頗嚴重。有統計1982至1997年間，最少2000名在職教牧人員移民他國。個別牧者以進修為為名，甚至獲教會資助進修，然後辭職，對牧養群體帶來傷害。也有牧者或信徒，匆匆移民離港，破壞了信徒間的關係。甚至有牧者為合理化移民而提出神聖理由，「主留」與「主溜」在教會內也形成張力。1988年，中國神學研究院主辦了一次有關去留的研討會，內容結集以《去留之間》（1989）為名出版。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) The Third Wave of the Charismatic Movement (Leung Ka-lun, 2002: 87-89; Christian Times, 1990, 1991b)\n\n\nIn March 1990, leaders of the Third Wave Charismatic Movement, John White and John Wimber, held the \"Worship, Power, and Renewal\" conference in Hong Kong, sparking heated debates among churches. Dr. Choi Yuen-wan, General Secretary of Breakthrough, expressed a positive view of the Third Wave, arguing that it should not be dismissed as \"heresy\" and that evangelical churches could learn much from it. He called for increased dialogue between evangelicals and Third Wave proponents.\n\n\nConversely, Pastor So Wing-chi of Evangelical Free Church Yan Fook Church criticized the Third Wave's emphasis on spiritual gifts like healing and power as extreme, warning that it could elevate healers and create misplaced authority. So acknowledged the Third Wave's faith, evangelistic zeal, and vibrant worship, which Hong Kong churches could emulate, but he cautioned against its focus on healing practices, which often involved lengthy sessions of laying on hands, rebuking, and speaking in tongues, potentially instilling guilt in participants and alienating those not healed.\n\n\nPastor Lau Siu-hong of the Hong Kong Baptist Church shared a balanced perspective. While agreeing that the Third Wave could enliven worship and prompt churches to reflect on their relationship with God and prioritize prayer, he advised caution regarding its practices of healing and speaking in tongues.\n\n\nIn July 1991, during the Fourth Chinese Congress on World Evangelization, a special panel discussion moderated by Pastor Stephen Tong brought together Choi Yuen-wan, Tang Chong-rong, and Chow Shen-chu to discuss the Third Wave. The sharp exchanges highlighted the divisions within Chinese evangelical churches over this issue.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Controversy Over Catholic Spiritual Writings, 1991 (Shi Qi, 1992; Wong Ho-yi, 1992; Christian Times, 1993, 1994; Leung Ka-lun, 2002: 89-90)\n\n\nIn 1991, Christian publisher Kairos Publications translated and published a series of spiritual writings by Catholic priest Henri J. M. Nouwen, which provoked mixed reactions in Christian circles. While Nouwen's works became bestsellers, inspiring Christians in prayer, meditation, and retreat practices, the decision by Kairos Publications faced significant criticism. Some theological educators and senior church leaders expressed concerns that general readers might struggle to distinguish Catholic doctrines from Protestant beliefs, posing a potential theological risk. As a result, the evangelical publisher China Alliance Press decided not to sell the Nouwen series. Other Christian bookstores followed suit, and some pastors discouraged their congregations from reading Catholic works.\n\n\nWong Ho-yi of the China Graduate School of Theology recognized the commonalities between Catholicism and Protestantism and acknowledged areas where Protestants could learn from Catholic practices. However, he emphasized caution, urging Christians to critically assess the spiritual teachings they encountered and ensure alignment with their core beliefs. He also noted that Protestant traditions already offered extensive writings on spirituality, suggesting that there was no urgency to turn to Catholic sources.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (3) The Second Schism of the \"Hong Kong Church,\" 1991 (Hong Kong Church, 1991; Wu Lung-yun, 2018: 66-67)\n\n\nThe \"Hong Kong Church,\" located on Observatory Road, traces its origins to Watchman Nee’s local church movement and the establishment of its meeting place in 1950. During the 1950s and 1960s, internal disputes arose between followers of Witness Lee and other members, leading to conflicts over property and usage of the Observatory Road premises. By the 1970s, opponents of Witness Lee’s teachings left, while his supporters continued to use the premises under the name \"Hong Kong Church.\"\n\n\nIn June 1991, 16 elders and co-workers, led by Fung Chi-li, issued a statement titled The Hong Kong Church Elders’ Statement on the Current Work Situation. The statement accused Witness Lee of deviating from biblical teachings, pursuing personal power and authority, and fostering personality cults. It criticized Lee for creating divisions among churches and causing many believers to stumble, tarnishing the church's testimony. The \"Hong Kong Church\" officially severed all ties with Lee and his organization, citing 12 theological objections to his teachings, including excessive glorification of Lee and interference in the church's operations.\n\n\nFollowing this split, a minority of Lee's supporters left to form a separate \"Hong Kong Church,\" later known as \"Local Church.\" The original congregation at Observatory Road became known as the \"Hong Kong Church - Church Assembly Hall (Christian Stewards).\"\n\n(1)第三波靈恩運動（梁家麟2002：87-89；時代論壇1990；時代論壇1991b）\n\n\n1990年3月，靈恩運動第三波領袖韋約翰（John White）及溫約翰（John Wimber）來港主領「敬拜，權能，更新」大會，引起教會爭論。其中，突破機構總幹事蔡元雲醫生對第三波靈恩運動持肯定態度，認為不應隨便判為「異端」，當中有不少值得福音派學習之處。他期望福音派可增加與第三波之間的對話。不過，播道會恩福堂蘇穎智牧師卻認為，第三波高舉權能醫治的屬靈恩賜是極端的做法，醫治者容易被抬高，透過權能換取權威，並不符合聖經的教導。他也承認第三波的信心，傳福音的熱誠，活潑的敬拜是香港教會可以學習的，但聚會中太著重醫治，花上長時間按手、指斥和講方言，會令與會者產生罪咎感，亦令那些未能被醫治者以為上帝不愛他。而香港浸信教會的劉少康牧師同意第三波可以把敬拜生活變得更活潑，提醒教會反省與上帝的關係，更重視禱告，但針對權能醫治及方言等屬靈恩賜，但需要小心。\n\n\n1991年7月，第四屆華福大會的最後一天，臨時召開一次特夠座談會，由滕近輝牧師主持，蔡元雲、唐崇榮及周神助就第三波問題有尖銳的對話，反映福音派華人教會對有關問題的分歧。\n\n\n(2) 天主教靈修著作的爭議1991（施齊1992；黃浩儀1992；時代論壇1993、1994；梁家麟2002：89-90）\n\n\n1991年，基道書樓翻譯出版天主教盧雲神父（Henri J. M. Nouwen）的靈修系列，在基督教圈子來引來不同迴響。一方面，盧雲的著作受到基督徒歡迎，成為暢銷書籍，掀動了基督徒對禱告、默想及靜修的新啟迪。另方面，作為基督教出版社的基道書樓，因為出版天主教神父著作，也面對不同壓力。由於有些神學教育工作者及教牧長者認為，一般的讀者未必能分辨天主教與基督教之間的教義分野，實有潛在性的危機，因此天道書樓有決定不出售基道出版的「盧雲系列」。除天道書樓外，尚有其他基督教書店不予發售，也有教會牧師反對信徒閱讀天主教的書籍。\n\n\n中國神學研究院的黃浩儀既肯定天主教信仰與基督教有共通之處，並有值得借鏡的地方，但他仍強調基督徒接觸天主教仍要多加留心，特別要認清所接觸的屬靈操練教導背後的信念是否可全盤接受？他認為基督教也有不少討論屬靈觀的著作，不必匆匆向天主教學習。\n\n\n(3) 「香港教會」第二次分裂 1991（香港教會1991；吳龍雲2018：66-67）\n\n\n「香港教會」位於天文道台，源自倪柝聲的地方教會，於1950年落成的聚會所。1950至60年代，內部出現受李常受教導的追隨者，雙方就天文台道聚會所使用及產權出現爭執，70年代左右反對李常受教者離開，認同李常受者繼續使用天文台道，稱「香港教會」。1991年6月，封志理等16位長老同工發表〈香港教會全體長老同工就當今工作局面的一些聲明〉，指李常受「言論性質已經明顯地違背了聖經教訓，行動上偏離了正路，轉而發展個人的權與利，並製造個人崇拜，因而排斥異己，造成眾教會中的大分裂，使無數聖徒跌倒。原本基督與其教會的榮耀見證，近年來亦大受玷辱與損害。」因此，「香港教會」決定與李常受及其工作組織系統「斷絕一切關係」。聲明從12分面批評李受常的神學，指李被過度高舉，又認為李干涉「香港教會」的工作及發展。結果，少數跟隨李常受者離開，另立「香港教會」（後稱「召會」）。原天文台道系統稱「香港教會－教會聚會所（基督徒管家）」。\n\n\n (4) The Election Committee Controversy, 1996  \n\n(Chan, 2003: 155-183; Brown, 2001: 28-38; Leung & Chan, 2003: 131-136; Lee Wai-ling, 1996; Xing Fuzeng, 1997a: 130-137; HKCC, 1996: 5; Leung Ka-lun, 2002: 108-110)\n\n\nAccording to the Basic Law, the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR was to be elected by a 400-member Election Committee, whose composition and formation were determined by the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. In 1996, the committee decided that nominations would be made by sectoral organizations, followed by screening and selection by the Preparatory Committee. The Election Committee comprised four sectors: (1) industry, commerce, and finance; (2) professionals; (3) labor, grassroots, and religious sectors; and (4) political representatives, including members of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. Christian representatives for the religious sector were nominated through the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC).\n\n\nThe process sparked significant controversy within the church community. Opponents argued that participating in the Election Committee violated the principle of separation of church and state and contradicted democratic ideals. From a Christian perspective, they maintained that the church’s mission was to uphold human rights and protect the vulnerable. Participation in the committee was seen as tacit endorsement of what they viewed as a regression in Hong Kong’s democratic progress. On May 17, 1996, several Christian organizations issued a joint statement opposing participation, emphasizing that the church must not align itself with actions undermining the rights of Hong Kong citizens.\n\n\nProponents contended that abstaining from the process would forfeit the opportunity to influence the system and amplify democratic voices within an imperfect framework. They argued that church involvement could mitigate adverse outcomes and maintain the church’s relationship with the SAR government. To address concerns about church-state separation, the HKCC proposed a \"Nomination Committee\" to nominate Christian candidates, who would then participate in the Election Committee as individuals. Once the Election Committee was formed, the Nomination Committee would be dissolved.\n\n\nIn April 1996, the HKCC resolved to participate in the nomination process. It reaffirmed that the church would not directly engage with political power structures and that nominees would act in their individual capacity. On November 2, the Election Committee was formed, and Christian representatives included Anglican Bishop Kwong Kong-kit, HKCC Chairman Sit Pan-kee, and YMCA Secretary-General Yuk Tak-fun.\n\n\nThis controversy set a precedent for similar debates during subsequent Chief Executive elections (2002, 2007, 2017). Each instance reignited questions about the church’s role in governance and the broader implications for its principles and mission.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (5) The National Day Celebration Controversy, 1996  \n\n(Leung & Chan, 2003: 125-131; Chen Shun-hing, 2000: 261-294; Xing Fuzeng, 1997b: 138-147; Leung Ka-lun, 2002: 103-106)\n\n\nAnother pre-1997 controversy in Hong Kong’s Christian community was the debate over self-organized National Day celebrations. Since 1995, Hong Kong’s six major religions had held a \"National Day Tea Gathering\" to celebrate the founding of the People’s Republic of China. In May 1996, a group of Christians proposed an alternative celebration, sparking internal disagreements.\n\n\nProponents of the self-organized celebration, including Fung Wai-man, Yu Tat-sum, and Lo Lung-kwong, presented several arguments:\n\n1. Transformative Perspective: Post-1997, recognizing the state did not equate to endorsing the Chinese Communist Party. National Day commemorated the establishment of New China, not the Party.\n\n2. Autonomy Perspective: Faced with pressure to celebrate National Day in a prescribed manner, the church could develop its own approach, asserting its identity while maintaining autonomy.\n\n3. Identity Perspective: The handover marked a shift in identity, from colonial subjects to SAR citizens, offering an opportunity for Christians to reflect on their identity as Chinese Christians.\n\n4. Priestly Perspective: Chinese Christians, as a \"priestly people,\" represented China before God, praying for the nation.\n\n\nOpponents, including Hu Lucy, Chu Yiu-ming, and Yang Mu-ku, offered counterarguments:\n\n1. Historical Reckoning: Without addressing past injustices, such as the Cultural Revolution and Tiananmen Square, celebrating National Day was insincere. For them, it was a day of national mourning, not celebration.\n\n2. Conspiracy Concerns: They questioned whether self-organized celebrations were orchestrated by Xinhua News Agency and whether church leaders sought political favor, accusing them of pandering to the regime.\n\n3. Mission Perspective: The church’s mission was to resist oppression, uphold justice, and protect the marginalized, maintaining a prophetic stance against power.\n\n\nOn May 24, 1996, 47 proponents held the Returning Journey: Pastoral Colleague Seminar to present their ideas. A survey revealed 46.1% supported the initiative, while 38.8% opposed it. Many felt 1996 was not the right time for such an event. Ultimately, the celebration took the form of a \"National Day Worship Service\" on October 1, 1996, attended by over 120 people. Preacher Fung Wai-man delivered a sermon titled On the Returning Journey: Embracing China.\n\n\nThe controversy reflected the church’s struggles with its identity and autonomy amid the \"China factor.\" It underscored differing attitudes toward national identity and revealed the challenges of navigating patriotism within a Christian framework.\n\n\n---\n\n\n (6) Era Declarations Leading to 1997  \n\n(Leung Ka-lun, 2002: 76-81)\n\n\nAs the 1997 handover approached, various denominations and organizations issued declarations and pastoral letters, including:\n\n- Era Declaration of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China (1995)\n\n- Declaration on the Prospects of Hong Kong by the HKCCCC (1995)\n\n- Biblical Basis for Facing Future Changes (Evangelical Free Church, 1996)\n\n- Returning Belief: A Proposal by the Christian and Missionary Alliance Hong Kong District (1997)\n\n- New Era Pastoral Letter (The Methodist Church Hong Kong, 1997)\n\n- United Journey of the SAR Church Pastoral Letter (1997)\n\n- 1997 Statement of the Hong Kong Christian Council (1997)\n\n- Declaration on Church Unity (HKCC, 1997)\n\n\nThese documents reflected the church’s efforts to address the political and social transformations of the time, articulating its vision for justice, human rights, and unity within the post-1997 landscape.\n\n(4) 推選委員會爭議1996（Chan 2003:155-183；Brown 2001:28-38；Leung & Chan 2003:131-136；李慧玲1996；邢福增1997a：130-137、香港基督教協進會1996：5; 梁家麟2002：108-110）\n\n\n根據《基本法》，第一屆特區行政長官由400人組成的推選委員會選舉產生。推選委員會的組成及產生方法，由特區籌委會負責。1996年，香港特別行政區籌備委員會（籌委會）通過先由各界團體提名，經篩選後定出差額名單，再由籌委會選出選委。推選委員會由四個界別組成：（一）工商、金融界；（二）專業界；（三）勞工、基層、宗教等界；（四）原政界人士、香港地區人大及政協。按規定，宗教界人士須向有關界別的團體報名。基督教界別的選委的報名及提名工作，則由香港基督教協進會負責。\n\n\n事件引發教會內極大爭議。反對者認為此舉違反政教分離原則，推委的產生亦有違民主原則。從基督教信仰理想出發，教會的使命乃維護人權，保障弱勢，推委事件暴露中方踐踏人權，教會必須堅守原則，不宜參與，否則等同認同中方為香港民主制度開倒車。1996年5月17日，香港教工業委員會、基督徒學會、婦女基督徒協會、基督徒關懷香港學會、基督徒學生運動、基督勞工教會等團體聯署〈基督徒反對教會加入推選委員會聯合聲明〉，指「教會的使命應是保障每個人的基本權利，促進人權的發展，保護在制度下受侵害的弱勢人士。在推委事件中，明顯地港人的意願無法表達。教會若參與推委會，即表示認同及參與侵害港人權利的事情。」\n\n\n但贊成者則認為協進會一旦放棄參與，即失去發揮影響力機會，必須爭取增加不合理制度內的「民主」聲音，阻止惡法。推委會雖有弊病，但已是勢在必行，籌委仍可委任基督教圈內人士出任，並聲稱代表基督教會，後果更壞。再者，教會應履行公民責任，不參與將影響教會與特區政府的關係。為符合「政教分離」，教會可以間接方式，組成「提名委員會」，再推選基督教界候選人，以個人名義參加，推委會產生後，提名委員會自動解散。\n\n\n1996年4月，基督教協進會經討論後，循特別會員大會中通過「參與特區推選委員會的產生」。協進會重申，教會不直接參與政治權力組織，協進會僅承擔「提名委員會」的角色，提名的基督教界選委乃是個人名義參與。\n\n\n11月2日，特區籌委會選出推委會。基督教界代表鄺廣傑（聖公會港澳教區主教）、薛磐基（基督教協進會主席）及郁德芬（基督教女青年會總幹事）當選。\n\n\n在隨後各屆特首選舉（2002，2007，2017，2017）中，基督教協進會均負責選出選舉委員會內的「基督教代表」。而每一次均面對教會內的批評及引發相同爭議 。\n\n\n(5) 基督教界自籌國慶爭議 1996（Leung & Chan 2003: 125-131；陳慎慶2000：261-294；邢福增1997b：138-147; 梁家麟2002：103-106）\n\n\n另一個在九七前引發教會界爭議的，乃基督教自籌國慶事件。自1995年起，香港六大宗教便開始舉行「國慶茶會」，慶祝中華人民共和國的成立。1996年5月，基督教內有人主張以另類方式慶祝國慶，結果引起教會內部極大爭議。\n\n\n主張自籌國慶者（包括馮煒文、余達心、盧龍光等47位發起人）的理由，可歸納為：（1）轉化論：1997後，香港成為中華人民共和國一部分，認同國家，不等於認同中國共產黨。十一是國慶，不是黨慶，此乃記念中國人民站起來新中國成立的日子；（2）空間論：香港教會面對如何慶祝國慶的壓力，要慶祝，又不想被牽著鼻子，按中方模式辦事，便應發展自身的慶祝方式，堅持基督教的主體性，未嘗不能維持及拓展自主空間；（3）承擔論：九七回歸是香港人身分的轉變，從殖民地子民變為中國特區公民，自籌國慶可確立香港的中國基督徒身分，思考此身分的意義；及（4）祭師論：中國基督徒乃祭司，在神面前即代表中國，在神眼中，我們就是中國。我們代表著中國，向神祈禱，也是中國向神祈禱。\n\n\n反對者（胡露茜、朱耀明、楊牧谷、繆熾宏等）的意見，可歸納為：（1）國殤論：中共政權若不肯面對歷史的過失，如文革及六四，教會不能真心誠意地慶祝國家的誕生。六四未平反，只有國殤，沒有國慶。當前中國宗教自由及對港政策，也沒有值得令人慶祝；（2）陰謀論：教會主動慶祝，是否新華社幕後策劃，教牧會否為了利益而靠攏政權。此乃向中共獻媚，塗脂抹粉之舉，與愛國無關。更有評論指「香港吳耀宗」呼之欲出；（3）使命論：教會使命乃抵抗強權、主持公義、扶助弱小。教會應持先知批判精神，挑戰社會壓制人民的權勢，為真理作戰。\n\n\n1996年5月24日，47位發起自籌國慶者召開「『回歸路上』教牧同工研討會」，闡述其理念。會上意見紛云，在收回問卷中，與會者中46.1%支持舉辦，而不同意者有38.8%。不過，大部分意見認為，1996年舉辦並不是好的時機。\n\n\n是次基督教內部爭議，亦引起社會廣泛關注。最後，在一片爭議聲中，有關活動改為「國家日崇拜」方式於1996年10月1日進行，拜逾120人參加，崇拜由馮煒文證道，題為〈回歸路上──承擔中國〉。\n\n\n是次自籌國慶爭議，反映出教會內部面對「國慶」的客觀事實，企圖以基督教的主體就中國人身份作反思的回應，這未嘗不是一種「合作中的另類表達」。而其激發的爭論，不僅說明教會內對「慶祝」國慶的憂慮，也反映出對「中國人身份」的不同取態。無論如何，不管是形式上或實質上，「愛國」成為香港教會界無法迴避的挑戰。\n\n\n選委及國慶事件，反映出隨著九七的臨近，「中國因素」愈益發揮效應。而教會內部的爭議，未嘗不反映出部分基督教人士在面對中國的現實下，企圖藉著參與體制，藉此爭取空間（選委）及維持自主性（國慶）的策略考量。事件引發教會內部的爭議，質疑有關「策略」是否可行，有否違反信仰的理念及原則。值得留意的是，關於基督教應否及如何選委，更在九七後歷屆選舉委員會的組成中，引起爭議。基督教民間團體反對參與選委，也可視之為與中國因素的「角力」。\n\n\n(6) 迎向九七的時代宣言 1995-1997（梁家麟2002：76-81）\n\n\n臨近九七，香港各宗派及機構先後發表宣言及牧函：〈中華基督教會香港區會時代宣言〉（1995）、〈中華基督教會香港區會對前景的宣言〉（1995）、〈播道會面對未來轉變的聖經基礎〉（1996）、〈回歸信念書──基督教宣道會香港區聯會獻議〉（1997）、〈循道衛理聯合教會新時代牧函〉（1997）、〈特區教會同心同行牧函〉（1997）、〈基督教協進會九七聲明〉（1997）、〈基督教協進會教會合一宣言〉（1997）。\n\n\n\n\nWorship of \"Shénzhǔ\" (Ancestral Tablets) Issue\n\nDuring that time, Protestant churches in Taiwan were predominantly of the Presbyterian system, and thus, there were no significant controversies in terms of structure, doctrine, or translational names. The use of the Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) romanization system, primarily translated by George Leslie Mackay, for the Bible was widely accepted, and there were no discussions regarding translation. The primary faith issue faced within the church was related to the \"Ritual Controversy\" during the process of conversion, with a focus on the worship of \"Shénzhǔ\" (ancestral tablets).\n\n\nBritish missionaries recognized the significance of this issue and openly called for essays in both Taiwanese and Mandarin regions. From 23 submitted essays, those by Wensanyuan, Lichalai, Yeh Hanzhang, Li Jiji, and Cai Tianshang were selected. Between 1886 and 1888, these articles were serialized under the title \"Debate on Shénzhǔ\" in the Taiwan Prefectural City Church News, with Yeh Hanzhang having the most contributions. The discussions in these articles often began with the historical origin and motivations behind setting up ancestral tablets. They tended to affirm the original intention of paying respects to ancestors and commemorating their virtues, with the secondary aim of hoping for blessings from the ancestors' spirits. However, contemporary perspectives leaned more towards the latter.\n\n\nFurthermore, the articles critiqued the irrational aspects of ancient practices such as \"Shīzhǔ\" (the deceased descendant sitting to receive sacrifices on behalf of the dead) and \"Mùzhǔ\" (ancestral tablets). For example, having a junior family member act as \"Shīzhǔ\" receiving sacrifices from senior family members was seen as contradicting the principles of filial piety. The use of \"Mùzhǔ\" was historically restricted to emperors and princes, not to be used by officials below the rank of ministers. The widespread use of \"Mùzhǔ\" by the general public was considered an inappropriate emulation of imperial practices. Critics argued that the ancestral spirits did not reside in the wooden tablets, and people were essentially worshipping the craftsmanship of the tablet makers.\n\n\nMoreover, treating wood as if it were one's ancestors was seen as a violation of filial piety, contrary to the teachings of the Ten Commandments. Authors quoted Confucius's teachings on filial piety, urging people to be filial to their parents but to also obey the will of God. They listed exemplary filial children throughout history and biblical figures, encouraging believers to follow their examples. Christians were reminded to mourn their parents with a sorrowful heart but advised against sacrificing or worshipping ancestors. The authors quoted the Fifth Commandment from the Ten Commandments to argue that filial children would receive blessings and that ancient filial children had already received blessings from God.\n\n\nThese articles condemned the worship of ancestral tablets as foolish and erroneous, urging people to believe in the one true God, adhere to the teachings of \"Honoring your father and mother\" in the Ten Commandments, and fulfill the \"true path of filial piety\" (Taiwan Presbyterian Church General Assembly History Committee 1965: 16; Wang Zhengwen 2012: 10; Li Chalai 1888: 38; Yeh Hanzhang 1887: 23; Yeh Hanzhang 1887.5: 35).\n\n祭祀「神主」議題。當時台灣的新教教會均為長老教會體系，因此在制度、教義、譯名方面並未出現明顯爭議，而當時普遍使用馬雅各主譯的白話字聖經，也未出現翻譯方面的討論。教內主要面對的信仰議題是改宗過程中「禮儀之爭」的問題，尤以祭祀「神主」為要。英國宣教士發現此議題的重要性，於是在台閩兩地公開徵文，在23篇來文中選出溫三源、李插來、葉漢章、李記際、蔡天賞五人的文章，1886年到1888年間以「辯神主論」為題《台灣府城教會報》連載，對於祭祀祖先之神主牌位的問題進行討論，以葉漢章連載次數最多。這些文章多從設立神主的歷史起源和動機論起，傾向肯定原初慎終追遠、紀念祖先德行的動機，其次才是盼望祖先的靈降福，但今人卻全然傾向後者。此外，文章評論古時「尸主」（由死者孫輩端坐，代替死者接受家族獻祭跪拜）和「木主」（神主牌位）的不合理之處，例如，若由晚輩擔任「尸主」接受長輩獻祭跪拜，豈非有違五倫？而「木主」在古代只有帝王諸侯能夠設立木主，從卿大夫以下均不得設立。現時眾人廣設木主，實乃是僭權行帝王諸侯之禮。古時帝王設立木主，只到7代，諸侯5代，大夫3代，現在卻到10代以上，並不合宜。論者並指出排位只是木頭，祖宗的靈魂不會在此居住；人花錢向製作牌位的師傅購買，向牌位跪拜，實則拜的是創作牌位的師傅；此外，將木頭當作先人其實是干犯不孝之罪，違背十誡孝敬父母的教導。有作者引用孔子對孝的教訓，勸人孝順父母，但更要服從上帝的旨意。其列出歷代著名孝子和聖經內的偉人，勸信徒比照仿效，更要基督徒以悲傷的心追悼父母，但不要獻祭或膜拜祖先。並引用十誡中的第五誡論證孝子能得福氣，而古代的孝子已經得到上帝的祝福。這些文章指責拜神主為愚昧和錯誤之舉，並勸人相信獨一真神，順從十誡中「孝敬父母」的教訓，以盡「真實的孝道」（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：16；王政文2012：10；李插來 1888：38；葉漢章1887：23；葉漢章1887.5：35）。\n\n\n\n\n**Non-church Movement**\n\n\nThe Non-church Movement advocates that faith in Christ does not necessarily require institutional structures and rituals, meaning one does not need to participate in church activities to practice their faith. This theory was founded by Uchimura Kanzō. In 1891, while serving as a substitute teacher, Uchimura refused to bow to the Emperor's signature next to the Imperial Rescript on Education, leading to attacks from his colleagues and students. This incident made him acutely aware of the tension between being \"Japanese and a Christian.\"\n\n\nDuring the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, Uchimura began to reflect on the justification of war and resolved to follow Christ's principle of non-resistance. After continued contemplation on the relationship between Christian faith and Japan, he realized that simply understanding church independence as freedom from Western missionary control could often devolve into narrow nationalism, losing the capacity to independently think about the nation's direction with God at the center. Therefore, he concluded that it was also necessary to free oneself from the constraints of nationalism and patriotism within other Japanese churches.\n\n\nHe understood that the independence of faith was not isolation or loneliness but \"relying on the God within the heart.\" This was Uchimura's way of maintaining a relationship with society without being subordinated to it. He defined the church broadly, opposing narrow, institutionalized interpretations. In other words, he advocated that faith in Christ does not necessarily require institutional structures and rituals, and one does not need to attend church gatherings to practice their faith.\n\n\nSeveral Non-church Movement activists were active in Taiwan during the 1920s, such as Inoue Inosuke, Yanaihara Tadao, Masamichi Jin, and Matsumoto Takashi. Yanaihara Tadao had the most direct influence on the Non-church Movement in Taiwan. In 1929, centered around Wang Shoulu, Cai Ronghua, Huang Lü'ao, and Lin Tianshui, the first Non-church gatherings among Taiwanese began, with about forty people participating in the initial meeting. Other Taiwanese individuals such as Guo Fangqin (a Presbyterian), Xie Wan'an, and Cai Haiqing joined in the 1920s.\n\n\nUnlike other Japanese churches' missionary activities in Taiwan, the Non-church Movement's evangelical activities primarily targeted Taiwanese people, setting it apart from other church missions (Chen Zhizhong 2005: 45-54).\n\n\n無教會主義。主張相信基督不必然要透過制度和儀式，即不用藉參加教會來實踐信仰。此論創始者為內村鑑三，1891他在擔任代課教師期間，於「教育敕語奉讀式」中未對天皇在敕語旁的簽名行鞠躬禮，而被師生攻擊，因而強烈意識到身為「日本人與基督徒」的張力。在日清和日俄戰爭中，內村開始反思戰爭的正當性，決意「效法基督的不抵抗主義」。在持續思考基督教信仰和日本的關係後，他發現單將教會獨立理解為脫離西方差會的控制，往往可能衍生成狹隘的愛國主義，失去以神為中心獨立思考民族方向的能力，因此最終也需脫離其他日本教會的民族主義和愛國主義思維桎梏。他意識到信仰的獨立不是孤立或是孤獨，而是「依賴心中的神」，這是內村與社會保持關係，但又不被統屬的交通方式。他從廣義的角度定義教會，反對從狹義、體制化的角度去理解。意即主張相信基督不必然要透過制度和儀式，不需藉參加教會聚會以實踐信仰。幾位無教會主義運動者在1920年代曾經在台活動，例如井上伊之助、矢內原忠雄、政池仁、松本巍等人。其中矢內原忠雄對台灣無教會主義思想影響最直接，1929年以王受祿、蔡榮華、黃履鰲、林添水共四人為中心，開始了最初台灣人的無教會聚會，第一次聚會大約有四十人參與。1920年代臺灣人尚有郭芳欽（長老教會信徒）、謝萬安、蔡海清等加入。相對於其他日本來台宣教的教會，無教會主義在台灣的傳道活動一直是以台灣人為主要對象，不同於其他教會所做的宣教事工（陳志忠2005：45-54）。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the overriding question of how to missionize this vast, newly-opened territory most quickly and effectively lay a deeper problem of theological and practical correctness.  By most accounts, the most pressing issue was not Chinese beliefs, which by all accounts were expected to fall away sooner or later, but rather the pernicious influence of other Christian missions who could potentially lead Chinese converts to error.  Expressed in the generally cool relations between the Catholic and Protestant missions, this division was considered by both missions to be of highest long-term importance.\n\n\nThe rivalry between the French Catholics and Scottish and Irish Presbyterians included issues of geopolitical and national pride, but was also the difference between two distinct philosophies of mission. Concerning the former, both French and British political legations in Beijing did at times attempt to claim the mantle of speaking for the interests of all Christian missions, regardless of nationality. The latter was a thornier problem. Missionaries often spoke of their rivals in terms as “heretics” and took particular pride in claiming converts from each other. Relations were not always hostile: Catholic and Protestant clergy would occasionally visit each other on festive occasions such as the opening of a new school or departure of an old missionary returning to Europe, but hostility was sometimes expressed openly, as when a Protestant missionary penned a newspaper article attacking the moral character of the French bishop, Verrolles.\n\n\nThe most significant differences were theological. Specific to mission field, the two had differing perspectives on the nature of (true) conversion, and the role of the missionary clergy. Simply put, Catholic practice aimed to create coherent and distinct villages of coreligionists, led by clergy, with institutions that would raise children in the faith and crucially provide the sacraments. (Of note: Catholic baptism of the dying, notably children, was a high sacramental priority that I doubt was viewed favorably by the Protestants.) Although the indigenous clergy had grown in number and more than proven themselves in the face of persecution and the hardship of ministering to villages separated by extremely long distances, there was as yet no serious discussion of creating a Chinese Church that was free of European leadership. The model of the Catholic mission was very much the Church Universal, highly structured, hierarchical, and centrally-led. \n\n\nIn contrast, the Protestant missions idealized the model of Pauline conversion, the individual, heartfelt calling by the Holy Spirit epitomized in model converts like Wang Jingming (Old Wang). Mission itself consisted of preaching on street corners and in humble churches, while the provision of services such as dispensaries and hospitals was a social gospel philosophy of winning converts through moral example. While the Catholics kept tight control over who amongst their ranks could minister and where, the Protestants prized the independence of the converts to preach in whatever way they saw fit, taking the lack of sophistication not as error but as evidence of heartfelt sincerity. This ideal is seen in the life stories of Protestant missionaries such as William Burns, who are portrayed (in positive terms) as so burning with the Holy Spirit that they started preaching right off the boat, regardless of their ability with the Chinese language. The elevation of sincerity (over doctrinal sophistication) as a primary virtue is replicated in the effusive praise given to converts like Old Wang.\n\n\nThe difference between the two mission strategies became clear as the Boxer violence loomed. The Protestant missionaries largely sought refuge in the port city of Niuzhuang, leaving the Chinese Christians to face what they understood to be a test of faith (often portrayed as divinely sent.). In contrast, the Catholic priests made a point of remaining with their churches, both congregation and building, which in some cases also provided physical defense to the community. In subsequent accounts, each made a point of emphasizing the lack of faith and willingness to apostatize by converts on the other side. This rift would remain throughout the next few decades and would signify the very different vision that each mission had for Christianity in China.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main doctrinal issue encountered by both Catholics and Protestants was how to respond to the Boxer violence on the one hand, and on the other, to the period of opportunity that followed its suppression.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, the Catholic missionaries saw it as their role to stay with the Manchurian church, while the Protestant missionaries were more willing to leave China or to seek refuge in an armed port like Yingkou. While the actual actions of missionaries did differ from this exaggerated difference (for example, Lalouyer, long term VA of Manchuria, newly installed as VA of Jilin fled to Japan, while many Protestant workers were indeed killed at their posts), the difference between the two did reflect a profoundly dissimilar philosophy regarding the role of foreign missionaries in the Chinese church. The Catholics regarded the missionaries as shepherds, and aimed through the provision of sacraments and social services to build complete and essentially self-sufficient Catholic communities. This vision is reflected in the preference for Catholics to reside in close proximity, to intermarry, and to raise children in the faith. The role of the priest as a spiritual center and the church building as a physical center reflected this image of the Catholic communities as islands within a pagan sea.  \n\n\nIn contrast, the Protestant missionaries always regarded themselves as a fleeting presence that would ignite the fire of faith and then leave the Chinese church to stand on its own. For this reason, and the fact that many missionaries arrived as couples or complete families they were more willing to flee when the need arose and view the Boxers as a test of faith for the Chinese believers to pass through on their own. Behind this belief is a further assumption about the nature of conversion. While the Catholic mission favored the model of raising children within stable Catholic communities, the Protestants idealized the model of Pauline conversion, a sudden, heartfelt transformation driven less by knowledge or training than by the direct calling of the Holy Spirit. \n\n\nWithout wanting to portray it as a matter of doctrine, the difference is still visible in the aftermath of the Boxers, as the two missionary communities compared notes concerning each other’s respective flock. Both Catholic and Protestant publications emphasized the steady faith of their own converts, while accusing the other of apostasy in the face of difficulty. Catholics were accused of promoting formulaic faith and relying on material benefits (especially help in lawsuits), while Protestants were accused of inflating their numbers by accepting anyone who expressed a fleeting desire to become Christian.  For different reasons, each accused the other of seeking quick wins and promoting shallow faith.\n\n\nAlthough the hostility between the two groups did die down somewhat, the difference in their mission methods and ideals remained evident in the period of expansion following the Boxer suppression. The Catholics used this time to rebuild institutions, including literally rebuilding destroyed church buildings. The Protestant world, both missionary and Chinese Christian, was swept up in a decade of revival.   \n\n\n\n\n\nI could not find anything resembling a doctrinal issue specific to this period.\n\n\nThe two previously discusses questions: whether to increase the pace of indigenization (the call for greater indigenization was particularly pronounced amongst Catholic clergy) and how to square the “imperialist” nature of mission Christianity with growing Chinese statism / nationalism remained in evidence.  The Protestant Union mission was at the forefront of this, with a 1926 statement that mission workers was simply “on loan” to Chinese churches, which retained autonomy. It was subsequently decided that the location and work of foreign missionaries by assigned by the Chinese Church itself.\n\n\nThe question of how to respond to Japan’s increasing presence in the region was not yet significant. The Protestants did tend to view Japan with greater suspicion than did the Catholics, in part because the conflict with native Protestants had already (1919) emerged in colonial Korea, although there was as yet no significant criticism of Japan in the Protestant missionary sources. Catholic express a clearer view that the Japanese presence was a force for progress, and a necessary counterbalance to the rise of Bolshevist infiltration from the South or from the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAlthough not doctrinal issues, this difference does reveal differing attitudes towards political pastoralism, i.e., the long-term presence of missionaries and the depth of long-term political and cultural influence that the two missions envisioned leaving in the region. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJilin VA Gaspais was active in campaigning the Holy See to reverse its centuries-old decision to ban Chinese Catholics from participating in ancestral or Confucian rites (and the definition of the latter as idolatry). This advocacy was in response to increasing role of public rites in the life of Manchukuo, including a legal instruction to maintain a Shinto shrine in classrooms, rites for the Manchukuo and Japanese emperors, and rites for the war dead. It mirrored crises in Japan, specifically one involving students at Catholic Sophia University in Tokyo that just narrowly avoided becoming a full-blown crisis (given the backroom maneuvering for and against the Church within the Japanese government). \n\n\nIn 1935, Propaganda Fide issued the instruction Pluries Instanterque formally not only allowing, but encouraging Catholic participation in civic rites that do not directly contradict their conscience as Catholics, as a duty of citizenship. Importantly, this instruction defined these criteria in subjective cultural terms, reviving in essence the much earlier Jesuit argument that because Chinese culture defines ancestor as veneration rather than as idolatry, that the Church should not impose their own definition on the act.  This decision was prompted most immediately by the threat of political crisis in Manchukuo and secondarily Japan. With the promulgation of Pluries Instanterque essentially creating precedent, the decision was then applied to similar centuries-old crises of perception and definition, such as the Malabar Rites in India and the disallowance of funerary rites in China, these bans being formally rescinded in 1940 and 1939, respectively. Although many priests on the ground had long taken a de facto forgiving stance to local custom, the formal recognition of the validity of local cultural understandings was a sea-change in Catholic policy that opened the door to Vatican II less than two decades later. This change was long in the making, but it was the threat of crisis in Manchukuo (and lobbying by people like Gaspais and bishops in Japan) that prompted action and set the Church on the road to becoming a truly global entity.\n\n\nA second but clearly related crisis concerned the pace of indigenization of the Catholic church, particularly the elevation of Chinese bishops and the transformation of administrative status from Vicariate Apostolic to diocese, that is, from a tutelary to a fully self-determining status. Growing an indigenous priesthood and divesting mission from national interest were already overt priorities of the global Church, as expressed in the 1919 Apostolic letter Maximum illud.\n\n\nYet unlike the question of cultural recognition, the political crises in Manchuria and across China slowed the pace of indigenization because it was felt that keeping the missionary presence would serve to protect the Church from external threats, particularly those of a foreign nature (where diplomatic cover would be useful and necessary). The greater these threats, the more intense the call to keep the Church under what was essentially diplomatic protection (the same logic as colonialism, it should be noted). The rhetoric surrounding indigenization was less about whether the local Church was ready in terms of sufficient faith (this question was largely settled as early as the Boxers), but rather whether the global climate was simply too dangerous for the Church to exist without European protection. Just like colonialism, the latter argument became difficult to support with the outbreak of war in Europe and the 1940 signing of the Tripartite Act that created the Axis. It would subsequently be revised to say that French (Vichy) sponsorship of the Church provided cover because France was now seen by the Axis as a friendly (or at least neutral) power, but would collapse immediately after the end of WWII, with the long-awaited creation of dioceses (headed by Chinese bishops) taking place across China in 1946. \n\n\n\nThe early half of the decade saw the acceleration of the war, including the entry of the United States. By this point, the Japanese empire as a whole was in the phase of total war, meaning that ideology, state-building or any other concerns had all taken a back seat to resource extraction and complete mobilization of the population. It also meant the expulsion of the Anglo-American missionaries, meaning that only the French Catholic missions were able to continue operation.  Although the latter were operated primarily (but not exclusively) by French priests of the MEP, technically allies with Japan, they were still observed closely by Manchukuo authorities, and often relied on Japanese Catholic intercessors in Manchuria and Tokyo.\n\n\n \n\n### Section: Anti-Christian Leaders (including competitors from secularisms and other religions who argued or campaigned against Christianity)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n이문열 李文烈 Mun-yeol Yi\n\n06/24/1948 ~ Present\n\n\nAlthough Lee Mun-yeol should not be categorized as a militant opponent of Christianity, his persistent critical stance toward Christian theology and worldview positions him as a significant anti-Christian intellectual figure of the 1990s. Throughout his literary career, particularly in works such as Son of Man (1979), Lee engaged Christianity not through outright hostility but through rigorous existential questioning. He framed Christianity not simply as a religious faith but as a Western ideological force competing with East Asian traditions such as Confucianism. Lee Mun-yeol is fundamentally a conservative writer deeply attached to Confucian traditions and held a strong sense of resistance toward Western civilization, which included Christianity as a major subset. For Lee, Christianity was not merely a religion but a symbolic force representing the cultural and philosophical conflict between East and West, framed primarily through the issue of “power.”\n\nHis major work, Son of Man (1979), deeply explores the theological foundation of Christianity while maintaining a critical stance. In this novel, Lee addresses core theological questions that had been prominent in 19th-century liberal theology: the tension between the divinity and humanity of Jesus, the question of whether Christianity emerged from Jesus' own teachings or from Paul's reinterpretation, and the absolute authority of the Scriptures. By portraying the divided consciousness of Jesus—His divinity and humanity—through the characters Min Yo-seop and Ahaseuerus, Lee invites readers to wrestle with the essential question: \"Was Jesus truly both fully divine and fully human?\" Son of Man also raises the issue of how a new religion—Christianity—could have emerged from a Jewish prophet like Jesus. Through the relationship between Min Yo-seop and Jo Dong-pal, Lee draws a parallel between Jesus and Paul, suggesting provocatively that \"Christianity originated from Jesus but was ultimately shaped by Paul's theology.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, although Lee did not bring Christianity back to the forefront of his later novels as he had in Son of Man, his deep engagement with Christian motifs persisted. As Cha Jungsik observed, Lee Mun-yeol should be seen as a writer who “internalized Christian theological images and motifs,” even though he was not a Christian himself. That is, Lee did not explicitly present himself as a Christian author, yet biblical themes and questions about the relationship between God and humanity continued to permeate his work.\n\nFrom a theological perspective, Lee’s approach to Christianity was notably unique. Rather than rejecting or ridiculing Christianity outright, he seriously grappled with the existential questions Christianity poses, while simultaneously casting doubt on its ultimate answers. His literary world consistently interrogated the human condition through the lens of Christianity without offering simplistic or triumphant resolutions.\n\nHowever, scholars have also pointed out limitations in Lee’s perspective. As Lee Dong-ha argued, because Lee centered his exploration around \"the problem of power\" in a highly secular and confrontational manner, true theological dialogue or mutual openness with Christianity was never fully realized. Christianity remained, in his eyes, an ultimately rival force against his deeply rooted East Asian traditionalism.\n\nNevertheless, the significance of Lee Mun-yeol’s engagement with Christianity during the 1990s can be summarized as follows:\n\nFirst, he accomplished one of the rare serious literary explorations of theological issues in modern Korean literature.\n\nSecond, he moved beyond both missionary literature and dismissive secular readings by treating Christianity as an existential human condition.\n\nThird, he bequeathed to readers not a simplistic call to faith, but a profound intellectual engagement with the fundamental questions Christianity raises.\n\nIn conclusion, Lee Mun-yeol stands as one of the most daring and complex figures in Korean literary history with regard to Christianity. Without identifying as a Christian himself, he nevertheless opened new intellectual and literary spaces for dialogue between Korean literature and Christian theology. His work challenged and expanded the boundaries of religious inquiry in Korean literature, offering readers a unique example of how literature can meaningfully engage theology without religious affiliation. Although Lee Mun-yeol was not a Christian, he significantly influenced Korean perceptions of Christianity by presenting it as a critical existential problem rather than merely a foreign ideology. His literary interrogation of Christian theology helped establish a new model for incorporating Christian motifs in Korean modern literature beyond simple advocacy or rejection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian leaders.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教領袖\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis decade did not witness any prominent anti-Christian leaders.\n\n此十年未有明顯反基督教的領袖\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) 孔聖會（張亦鏡1919）\n\n\n1917年香港孔教會在倡議立孔教為國教時，針對基督教展開抨擊。惟其機關報《國是報》已失佚，有關香港孔教會的論述，主要來自張亦鏡引述。其中孔教會筆戰人士，均為筆名，如菱花、澄父、賸聲、大聲、鐸等。（詳參下文）\n\n\n(1) The Confucian Society of Hong Kong (1917)  \n\nReference: Zhang Yijing (1919)  \n\n\nIn 1917, the Confucian Society of Hong Kong, advocating for Confucianism to be established as the national religion, launched attacks against Christianity. Although the society's official publication, The National Affairs Report (Guo Shi Bao), is now lost, discussions about the Confucian Society are primarily derived from quotations in Zhang Yijing’s writings.  \n\n\nThe key participants in the Confucian Society’s written debates used pseudonyms such as Ling Hua, Cheng Fu, Sheng Sheng, Da Sheng, and Duo.

In his early years, he defeated local tycoon Wu Zhenkun and constructed irrigation systems such as the Baishui River Canal, the Touqian River Canal, and the Machouhou Canal. In addition, for his contributions to quelling the Taichōshun Incident in 1863, he was awarded the title of magistrate of Douliu. He also built the Magistrate's Office, restored the Dianzai Kou Wen Shrine, established the Yushan Academy, and donated funds for temple construction. All these endeavors helped him establish a solid local power base.\n\n\nHowever, he harbored hostility towards Christians. In 1875, under the pretext that the church built by George Leslie Mackay in Baishui River would disrupt the feng shui of the Wu family's ancestral tombs, he sent people to burn down the church and Mackay's residence. After the court trial, Wu Chi-kau was acquitted but had to bear compensation costs. Nevertheless, he did not stop there; he continued to gather supporters to attack Christians in the Baishui River area.\n\n\nIn 1876, conflicts arose between church member Wen Wang and Wu Chi-kau and his allies, including Zhang Xing. Wen Wang was first blinded by Wu Chi-kau's henchmen, and in April 1877, he was killed by Wu Chi-kau at the head of Niuchou. Wen Wang's son, Wen Mu, and Xiang Maochun were also injured by Zhang Xing and others with knives. In November of the same year, Wu Chi-kau's followers again burned down the Jibei Church. Mackay sought the intervention of British Consul A. Frater, and the Chiayi County government held a public trial in front of Yanqian, where Wu Chi-kau, realizing his wrongdoings, built a new church as compensation.\n\n\nIn local records and historical materials, Wu Chi-kau's image appears positive due to his significant contributions to local development. However, he realized that the presence of the church challenged his dominance in the Baishui River area as the church began to influence the local residents. The church's continued expansion beyond his control would undoubtedly undermine his dominant position. Thus, he resorted to violent means to prevent the uncontrolled presence of Christians within his sphere of influence.\n\n\n吳志高（Wu Chi-kau[Ngô Chì-ko], 1827.1.3-1880）。乳名墻，字玉屏，生於台灣府嘉義縣糞箕湖莊潭底（今台南市白河區河東里），早年因打敗地方土豪吳振坤，在地方上修築白水溪圳、頭前溪圳、馬稠後圳，加上1863年平定戴潮春事件有功而受賞斗六都司銜。此外，他興建都司府、修復店仔口文祠、創立玉山書院，並捐款興建廟宇。凡此種種，讓他建立穩固的地方勢力。但是他偏惡基督徒，1875年藉口甘為霖在白水溪建立教堂會破壞吳家祖墳風水，遂派人燒毀教堂以及甘為霖住所。對簿公堂後吳志高被判無罪，但須負擔賠償。然而吳志高並未罷手，仍然糾集黨羽攻擊白水溪一帶的基督徒。1876年吉貝耍教會信徒溫旺與吳志高及同黨章興發生衝突。溫旺先遭兩人的黨徒挖眼，1877年4月更在牛稠埔頭遭吳志高殺害，同行的兒子溫木和向茂春被章興等人持刀砍傷。同年11月吳志高黨羽又燒毀吉貝耍教會，甘為霖請英國領事福雷特（A. Frater）出面，嘉義縣府在岩前公審，吳志高自知理屈，新建仙草埔岩前禮拜堂以賠償。在地方志和文史資料中，吳志高形象正面，對地方開發貢獻良多。然而他意識到教會的存在讓其在白水溪的地位受到挑戰，因教會已對當地居民產生影響；教會繼續擴張，超越他的掌控，勢必影響到他的霸主地位。遂以暴力威脅之手段，防止其勢力範圍內不受控制的教徒存在（王政文 2014：118-121；洪波浪、吳新榮 1980：100-101；賴永祥 1990：210）。\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Japanese colonial regime firmly established its rule over Taiwan, the anti-Christian incidents that were common in the late Qing Dynasty disappeared, and there were no organized anti-Christian movements or leaders. By the mid-1920s, many Christians had become key members of society. Although they were a minority, they were highly influential and no longer as easily targeted for attacks by the local gentry as they were during the late Qing period. The previous collusion between local government officials and gentry to incite such attacks was also no longer seen.\n\n\n日本殖民政權領台底定之後，清末時常出現的反教事件已消聲匿跡，並無組織性的反教運動和反教領袖。1920年代的日治中期許多基督徒已成為社會中堅份子，雖佔少數但深具影響力，不復如清末地方仕紳那般容易煽動民眾予以攻擊，過去地方官府與仕紳連成一氣的情況也不復見。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reasons discussed in 6. below, I can find no named leaders that emerge as enemies of Christianity. \n\n\nRather, the groups that appear as most likely enemies are social types. These include conservative townspeople and villagers, officials who are either personally set against Christianity/foreigners or simply want to remove those who would create the conditions for violence. Protestant sources note that Manchu elites in northern cities like Qiqihar and Jilin tended to be more reflexively anti-Christian. Those with a direct conflict include doctors who were in competition from the mission dispensaries and local educated elites (such as sishu teachers), who proclaimed that the Christians were here to replace Confucius. \n\n\nZailijiao, a religious teaching that erupted into violence in 1892, is credited with an inchoate hatred of Christians and foreigners, but it is not at all clear how this was related to their teaching, whether it represented a variation of apocalyptic violence, or if it was simply a precursor of Boxer attitudes.\n\n\nEach of these types of anti-Christian groups had a common element: they were disorganized and leaderless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the violent anti-Christian movements of this decade, it is difficult to find anything resembling a leadership structure. As a phenomenon, the Boxers themselves were famously leaderless, and the period of violence in Manchuria would seem to bear that image out. No sources give any indication that the movement was directed by any individual or that it had any sort of geographic center. From which instructions or strategy emanated. The only people who are identified are occasional county-level officials (“mandarins” in the sources) who had previously maintained cool relations with the missionaries, and used the outbreak of violence to “let fall the mask” (in the words of one French mission) and encourage the Boxers from behind the scenes. The rare instance of open hostility during the previous decade reached a violent peak during the few months of Boxer activity, notably in the county of Hulan where three Catholic missionaries were killed. That county would later emerge as a Catholic stronghold after that particular official was replaced.\n\n\nLater and shorter-lived outbursts of localized violence would follow this same pattern, often at the instigation of a local official who was able to direct violence against Christians. \n\n\n(Note that I use the term “Boxers” as a shorthand. It is clear that the actual violence did include the Boxers in their “classic” form, but also a variety of opportunists such as demobilized soldiers, who used the occasion to loot or extort Christian villages, or simply to settle existing scores. If anything, the “Boxer” violence was a precursor to the subsequent decades of “bandit” lawlessness that would engulf the region.)\n\n\nThere was some resentment from specific communities such as doctors, especially in the aftermath of the plague of 1910. This will be mentioned in the coming decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone to speak of.\n\n\nConsidering that we are only a couple of decades away from the Boxers, it is safe to assume that missionary writers would have been very sensitive to any potential threat. \n\n\nYet even sources that occasionally mention that a student or local official had some harsh words to say about the Christians, no names are given, and there is no follow up that would indicate a particularly irksome individual or organized anti-Christian movement. For the latter, please see below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n### Section: Anti-Christian Organizations (including competing organizations of secularisms and other religions that campaigned against Christianity)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Federation of University Student Councils\n\n\nThe formation of an anti-Christian culture on Korean university campuses was not merely a matter of negative sentiment toward Christianity, but was deeply connected to ideological shifts within the student movement, evolving political identities, and changes in the socio-cultural structure of campus life. At the center of this transformation stood the Korean Federation of University Student Councils (HanChongRyun), which based its ideological foundation on Kim Il-sung’s Juche ideology and regarded Christianity as a religion complicit with capitalism and conservative political powers. From this perspective, Christianity was not merely a belief system but a hegemonic tool of oppression, thereby justifying the proliferation of anti-Christian sentiment in campus activism.\n\nStudent movements were not initially anti-Christian. During the 1980s democratization era, many Christian youth participated actively in human rights and justice-centered activism. However, as the 1990s progressed, Marxist-Leninist thought, anti-imperialism, and Juche ideology became dominant currents within the student movement, and Christianity was increasingly criticized as a bourgeois religion, a colonial remnant, and an anti-revolutionary structure. Despite some overlap with liberation theology or Minjung theology, Christian student groups were increasingly marginalized and dismissed as “non-struggling religious conformists.” In the midst of this, Christian Student Union (Giyeon) emerged as a response. Beginning in 1990 with the formation of the “Seoul National University Christian Union,” similar groups were established at Korea University (1991), and by 1993, at Myongji University, Sogang University, Yonsei University, Ewha Womans University, and Hongik University. These groups organized joint Christmas events and campus-wide worship services, and in 1994, they formed the “New General Christian Student Union,” which expanded to a broader regional network in 1995 through regular Giyeon retreats.\n\nDespite these efforts, Giyeon members faced significant structural and cultural barriers. Because many university student councils were controlled by HanChongRyun-aligned activists, Christian groups were often denied access to campus facilities, limited in their event planning, and restricted from posting announcements. Their presence on campuses dominated by political demonstrations and nationalist rhetoric was interpreted as passive or even traitorous. Even worship and prayer meetings were ridiculed as naive and politically neutral, rather than courageous acts of conscience.\n\nTensions intensified as HanChongRyun advanced the notion of “Criticism of Pure Academism,” denouncing students focused on academic achievement as bourgeois collaborators. In this environment, Christian students who emphasized personal faith and scholarship were portrayed as socially irresponsible. In some cases, Christian campus groups were directly excluded from campus life, or found their meeting times overlapped with political rallies, creating unavoidable conflict. Under such scrutiny, even regular worship gatherings had to be carried out discreetly.\n\nAnti-Christian sentiment was also spread systematically through educational and ideological training. HanChongRyun developed a multi-stage “consciousness-raising program” using student orientations, MTs (Membership Trainings), and cultural events. These programs emphasized dissatisfaction with reality (Stage 1), critique of capitalism (Stage 2), and revolutionary socialist theory (Stage 3), wherein Christianity was dismissed as false consciousness aligned with imperialism and bourgeois power. Propaganda materials—such as BBC’s “Kill 'Em All” or footage from North Korea—were shown to new students to incite anti-American and anti-Christian attitudes simultaneously.\n\nCulturally, anti-Christian sentiments were embedded in the organization of campus events. Student councils often promoted performances and festivals filled with vulgarity and violence, intentionally conflicting with Christian values. Rallies and protests were sometimes scheduled to interrupt Christian worship services. Campus newspapers, flyers, and performances further spread mockery and criticism of Christianity. This made it psychologically difficult for Christian students to publicly identify as believers.\n\nIn sum, the anti-Christian culture of the 1990s was shaped by ideological hostility, institutional marginalization, cultural antagonism, and educational indoctrination. These dynamics deeply affected not only the religious life of Christian students but also their social identity and participation in campus life. Yet in the midst of this environment, the Giyeon movement persisted—cultivating solidarity among Christian students, advocating a gospel-centered alternative vision, and planting the seeds of spiritual renewal that would bear fruit in later decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教組織\n\n\n\n\nThis decade did not witness any prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年未有明顯反基督教的組織\n\n\n\n\n(1) The Confucian Society of Hong Kong (1917)  \n\nReference: Zhang Yijing (1919)  \n\n\nIn 1917, the Confucian Society of Hong Kong advocated for Confucianism to be established as the national religion and launched criticisms against Christianity as part of this effort. While the society's official publication, The National Affairs Report (Guo Shi Bao), has been lost, most of the existing discourse about the society is based on quotations provided by Zhang Yijing.  \n\n\nThe key contributors to the debates from the Confucian Society used pseudonyms, including Ling Hua, Cheng Fu, Sheng Sheng, Da Sheng, and Duo.

In an October report, Liang described Hong Kong as being dominated by Christianity and Confucianism, noting that church-affiliated schools and Christian organizations were pervasive, including 42 schools for the poor and outreach activities in factories and businesses.  \n\n\nDespite these observations, the CCP initially adopted a strategy of \"delayed opposition\" toward Christianity due to a lack of personnel. Nonetheless, in November 1923, the Hong Kong branch decided to print anti-Christian pamphlets during Christmas, a move endorsed by the Guangdong Regional Committee. That Christmas, pamphlets titled The Crimes of Christianity were distributed, accusing Christianity of impeding science and progress, promoting imperialism, and oppressing workers.  \n\n\nIn early 1924, the CCP proposed forming student organizations to counter Christianity, such as the \"Student Friends Society.\" Reports described confrontations between CCP activists and Christians, with heated debates becoming a common occurrence. A May report highlighted efforts to oppose Christian organizations, particularly the YMCA, while aiming to infiltrate church schools.  \n\n\nAlthough these efforts mirrored the broader anti-Christian movement in China, they failed to mobilize large-scale support in Hong Kong, where Christian organizations maintained strong influence.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n### (2) St. Paul’s College Strike Incident (1925)  \n\n(Sources: Central Archives, Guangdong Archives 1982; Jiang Guansheng 2011: 49)  \n\n\nIn May 1925, the CCP Hong Kong branch reported on a failed student strike at St. Paul’s College. Many leading students withdrew or transferred to other schools following the strike. The CCP acknowledged that none of its members were enrolled at the college at the time, though they had begun activities within the school.  \n\n\nThe CCP Central Committee advised caution in engaging with English schools, urging discreet efforts to discourage students from aligning with imperialist values. After the May Thirtieth Incident in Shanghai, the Hong Kong branch intensified its focus on student movements, facilitating the formation of the \"Hong Kong Students’ Federation.\" While students from Queen’s College were the first to strike, St. Paul’s College students also participated by returning to their hometowns in support of the movement.  \n\n\nThese efforts reflected the CCP's strategy of leveraging student movements to challenge imperialist education and religious influence, although their success in Hong Kong was limited.  \n\n(1)中共香港支部反基督教部署 1923-1924（中央檔案館、廣東檔案館1982）\n\n\n中國共產黨在1921年成立後，1923年左右已在香港開展工作，成立團香港特支（梁寶龍2013）。\n\n特支幹部梁鵬萬在10月的調查報告中，形容「全港學商是基督教和孔教包圍，各洋行職員全是教徒，有些是孔教教員，公立學校的教員全是教徒」。又指基督教設平民學校42所，每星期除在禮拜堂、青年會演講外，又會到各病院、工廠、商店（如永安、先享）等處演講。就整體學校情況，團香港地委在報告中形容，香港「學生雖多，實少覺悟分子」。團地委又特別調查教會及體育團體，指出「努力進攻孔教會及為精武體育會做建設的工夫」，「對於基督教會則暫取緩攻態度」。有關「緩攻」的原因，是「現時同志缺少」。即或如此，團香港地委在23年11月常委會會議中，仍決定在聖誕日印反對基督教傳單。團粵區委認為香港地委就「耶誕日反對基督教」所擬的計劃「甚妥」。\n\n\n在是年聖誕期間，即有散發「非教的傳單」。中國非宗教大同盟港支部在1923年發表〈基督教的罪惡〉的告同胞書，指基督教「在光天化日之下，肆意橫行，興狀大崇」，「自命為『慈善者乎』。宣言除一般反對基督教「阻礙科學及進化」，導人入「迷信」外，亦針對近代基督教入華後，教案與喪權辱國之事的關係，基督教成為帝國主義「亡人心者」之利器。又抨擊基督教「資助資本家以壓迫」。最後，呼籲聯合起來制行救國運動，「反對罪惡滿盈的基督教！教會！青年會！」1924年1月，在〈香港團組織及工作情況〉中，形容香港「資產階級」及「知識階級」，大多是基督徒。並且，就去年聖誕節「發散傳單，攻擊基督教徒」，但卻被青年會及教會領袖反駁。報告指基督教提出「宗教救國」，實乃「亡華機關」。\n\n\n1924年2月的工作報告中，分別提出在學界成立工作組織（「學友社」或「香港學生文藝研究社」）的可能。又提及針對基督教，「除了刊發傳單外，並時有口頭的攻擊」，並與教徒「發生劇烈的爭辯……成為對疊之勢」。而在3月報告中，則提及有「帝國主義者實施其奴隸教育及基督教義，因此香港學生絕無覺悟，與新文化格格不入，學生運動，似無希望」；「港地學生，半同孔教束縛，半受耶教束縛，絕無覺悟」，因此須「暫緩進行」學生運動。\n\n\n從團香港地委在1924年5月的一年來工作報告中可見，曾以「反對基督教大同盟港支部」名義反對青年會，結果「惹起教徒反響」。《大光報》曾撰反對文章來回應。最後，決議要揭破「港地孔教復辟思想、基督教的迷信思想背後皆為麻醉青年的毒物」，爭取更多人加入反基督教大聯盟。同時，更須努力從速教會學校成立學生支部。1924年7月的團香港地委會議中，亦討論如何回應有教徒的攻擊，指要「繼續向教會攻擊，宜多引事實證明其係帝國主義者的先鋒，並揭發其陰謀」。12月，向中央報告中，提及「反對基督教案」，計劃派發5000傳單。\n\n\n從上述檔案可見，中共香港支部針對基督教鬥爭的方法，與其中國策動非基督教運動相同，即指控其與帝國主義關係的，希望策動學生運動，並將矛頭指向基督教青年會及教會學校。不過，跟中國各地大規模的反對基督教群眾運動相比，香港的反對基督教鬥爭並能成功動員。\n\n\n(2) 聖保羅書院罷課風波 1925（中央檔案館、廣東檔案館1982；江關生2011：49）\n\n\n1925年5月，團香港地委報告提及「香港聖保羅罷課風潮」失敗，「主動學生多退學轉校」，又指正積極進行「第二次之舉動」。不過，是次罷課似乎並非由中共策動，因為在報告中指「同志亦無一是在校學生……現我們已入去活動，且因此而被政府偵得、監視」。當時團中央回覆：「英文學校事，參入其中工作應謹慎秘密，宣傳他們勿作帝國主義之教徒，勿再學亡國的奴隸教育。現在香港工潮已起，須注意分配同學實除活動，並特別注意收納新生」。及五卅慘案後，團香港地委報告中，提到已派兩位同學策動學生罷課，並成立「香港學聯會」，由皇仁書院學生首先罷課，聖保羅亦有學生罷課回省。\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年間未有明顯的反基督教組織\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, the main opposition to and impact on Christianity primarily took place during the Japanese occupation period. Please see the text below for further details.\n\n此十年主要反對及衝擊基督教者，主要是日治淪陷時期，參下文。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian organizations.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教組織\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, although there were struggles targeting Christianity during the 1967 riots, these efforts were primarily led by the leftist faction in Hong Kong.

However, in order to appease the anti-Christian sentiments of the populace and the gentry or to accommodate popular sentiment, it may cooperate. Moreover, some missionaries extend consular jurisdiction to their followers or intervene in cases related to their followers, challenging the prestige and authority of the government. For example, in 1876, after the conversion of teacher Li Xiandeng and his father Li Dongmian in Zhouli (now Luzhou District, New Taipei City), their relatives believed that they no longer participated in ancestral worship, thus forfeiting the right to the land left by their ancestors, i.e., encroaching on their land. When the two and other believers filed a complaint at the yamen, the yamen officials arrested the believers and rebuked them, saying, \"Abandoning one's ancestors and religion to follow those 'barbarians' is unfilial and disloyal.\" The believers were then shackled and imprisoned. They were later subjected to whipping and other tortures and were escorted to Taiwan Prefecture. The Li father and son were subsequently beheaded, their heads were placed in baskets labeled \"heads of converts,\" and they were brought back to Mengjia, where they were hung at the city gate as a warning. The remaining believers were detained again, and two of them died from torture and hunger. However, Fujian Governor Ding Rirang reported that the Li father and son were usually despised in their hometown and relied on religion for self-preservation. He also reported that when Magistrate Chen Xingju of Danshui Hall presided over the trial in Mengjia, Li Dongmian brandished a knife and caused public outrage, leading to his immediate arrest. However, George Leslie Mackay opposed the government's account and pointed out years later that officials and gentry admitted this was a scheme, and the believers were innocent victims. The government and gentry's purpose was to proclaim to the masses that those who joined the \"evil religion\" would eventually meet this fate. （馬偕2007：102；王政文2012：10-11；王政文2014：123；蔡蔚群2000：241；中央研究院近代史研究所1975：1510；林金水2003：226）。As the church's influence gradually spread to the grassroots level, the officials and gentry felt threatened and spread rumors, leading to the initiation of religious cases. On the one hand, some people relied on religion for self-preservation or exoneration, leading to a negative impression of \"relying on barbarian power\" (khò hoan-á-sè), allowing the officials and gentry to find opportunities, such as wars, to vent their emotions on the church or believers.\n\n\n官府。官府表面上必須維護傳教權利，但為了迎合、平息民眾和仕紳的反教情緒或因民氣可用而予以配合。而且，有些宣教士運用領事裁判權延伸到教民身上，或干涉與教民相關的案件，挑戰官府的威望和權威。例如1876年洲裡（今新北市蘆洲區）教師李先登與其父李東面在改宗後，宗族的族人認為他們不再參與宗族祭祀，因此已無權利繼續擁有祖先所遺留下來的土地，即佔去其田地。兩人與馬偕和其他教徒在衙門申告時，衙吏抓住眾教徒，官吏斥之「把自己的祖宗和宗教丟棄而去跟隨那個『番仔』，是不孝和不忠義的。」遂將教徒銬上鎖鍊並下監。之後受到鞭笞和其他酷刑，又被押解到台灣府，李氏父子先後遭斬首，頭顱被置於籃子，寫上「入教的人頭」，再帶回艋舺，懸掛於城門示眾，其餘教徒再被下獄拘留，其中兩人死於酷刑與飢餓。然而，福建巡撫丁日昌奏報李氏父子等人平素魚肉鄉里，因而恃教自保，又報告稱淡水廳同知陳星聚在艋舺審案時，李東面持刀鬨堂，引起仕紳公憤而當堂拘捕。然而馬偕反對官府上述陳述，並指多年後官紳承認此為計謀，教徒乃無辜受害，官府和仕紳的目的是為向群眾宣告凡入「邪教」者終有此命運（馬偕2007：102；王政文2012：10-11；王政文2014：123；蔡蔚群2000：241；中央研究院近代史研究所1975：1510；林金水2003：226）。當教會勢力逐漸蔓延至底層社會，官紳感到威脅，進而散佈謠言，發動教案。一方面某些民眾恃教自保或脫罪，出現「靠番仔勢」（khò hoan-á-sè）的負面印象，讓官紳找到諸如戰爭等機會，將情緒發洩在教會或教徒身上（王政文2014：126）。\n\n\nLocal temples serve as the focal point of folk beliefs and represent the primary network of unofficial local power. Through temples, local authorities establish power relations with the masses. Additionally, local temples serve as channels for communication between the government and society, while also serving as places for the government and local leadership to establish authority and social mobility. Local gentry who have achieved fame and local elites possessing official stamps often take on the responsibility of organizing rituals or celebrations. These gentry or elites compete for resources and support for temple rituals based on their local networks, accumulating social capital through activities such as rituals, donations or fundraising, temple construction, inscriptions, and plaques. In Taiwanese Han society, ethnic and religious relationships are closely intertwined, making it difficult to separate local ritual alliances from administrative alliances. Local landlords or heads of cultivation areas include tenant farmers in a shared system of communal rituals, forming mechanisms for regional alliance groups. The case of Wu Zhigao illustrates how he leveraged participation in local construction and temple activities to establish local power. Wu Zhigao and other anti-Christian gentry and local elites are embedded in temple networks, mutually influencing each other. Although it cannot be conclusively stated that temples are direct bases for anti-Christian forces, these anti-Christian individuals use their relationships with temples to gain resources and support against Christianity. In contrast to temples, churches and missionaries symbolize Western forces opposed to local traditional power and pose challenges to local traditional power. The cases of Wen Wang and Li Dongmian's persecution clearly reflect the rejection of Christianity by local power, illustrating how those in positions of authority attempt to maintain the existing order dominated by folk beliefs in the social context (Wang Zhengwen 2014: 123-124).\n\n\n地方廟宇。宮廟是民間信仰的祭祀中心，亦為地方勢力非官方主要網絡，地方勢力亦透過廟宇達成與群眾之間的權力關係。此外，地方廟宇是政權與社會之間溝通意見的管道，同時扮演政府和地方領導階層建立權威與社會流動的場所。取得功名的地方仕紳等鄉治代理者以及領有官方牌戳的地方菁英，往往也擔負舉辦祭祀或慶典之責。仕紳或菁英按其地方的關係網絡爭取廟宇舉辦祭祀的資源和支持，再透過祭祀活動、捐款或募款、建廟、題字、獻匾等善行累積社會資本。在台灣漢人社會族群和宗教關係密切，地方的祭祀聯庄和行政聯庄幾乎難以分割，地方墾首或地主在共同的拓墾地區內，將佃戶納入共同祭典的體系中，成為地區聯庄組合的機制。由吳志高的案例可見，他藉參與地方建設和廟宇活動，建立地方勢力。吳志高和其他反教仕紳、地方菁英鑲嵌在廟宇網絡關係中，或可說互為表裡，雖然不能斷言廟宇是反教勢力的直接基地，但這些反教人士卻是藉著與廟宇的關係建立勢力，因而獲得反教的人力和聲量資源。相對於廟宇而言，教堂及宣教士在宗教和社會意義上象徵與之對立的西方勢力，且對地方傳統勢力而言也是挑戰。從溫旺和李東面遭害的案例，即明顯反映地方勢力對基督教的排斥，也說明社會脈絡中有權者為維護既有勢力而企圖穩住以民間信仰為主的既有秩序（王政文2014：123-124）。\n\n\n\n\n**Japanese Colonial Regime**: From 1896 to 1930, the relationship between the Japanese colonial government and Christianity was relatively harmonious, and religious freedom was allowed, leading to better development of Christianity compared to the Qing Dynasty period. However, the Japanese regime prohibited Christian churches and other religions from proselytizing to the indigenous people. Under its \"aborigines policy,\" it attempted to assimilate the indigenous people through the spread of Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism to achieve effective governance. Some scholars point out that after 1895, Japan became the only colonial power in Asia. Lacking colonial experience, Japan studied and emulated the colonial practices of Western countries like the Netherlands and the UK, thus placing importance on the role of religion in colonization. \n\n\nThe cooperation between Buddhism and colonialism began with the Jodo and Soto schools. Some missionaries preached within the boundaries of the indigenous areas. Later, with the support of the Japanese government, missionary work in indigenous areas was primarily undertaken by the Honganji branch of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism (Fan Chun-wu, 1999:255). In addition to collaborating with familiar Buddhist sects in Taiwan, the Japanese government especially promoted its state religion, Shintoism, to instill patriotism and assert control. As Shintoism was not merely a religion but also a symbol of the Japanese nation and the imperial family, it advocated loyalty to the imperial family and worship of its ancestors. The Japanese government extensively established Shinto shrines in the mountainous regions, enforced worship, and banned the promotion of other religions (Historical Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan General Assembly, 1965:206, 365). \n\n\nUnder these circumstances, traditional indigenous religions were significantly weakened, and various traditional festivals were banned. The church actively planned to evangelize the mountainous regions from the early 20th century but was consistently prohibited, making missionary work impossible. However, some indigenous people who encountered Christianity outside the mountainous regions became pioneers in mountain evangelism, such as Jiwang, Xu Nanmian, Gao Tianwang, and Dawai (Lin Jinshui, 2003:268-269).\n\n\n日本殖民政府（Japanese Colonial Regime）。1896年以後，1930年之前，日本殖民政府與基督教之間的關係相對和諧，也允許宗教自由，使基督教得到較清朝時期更好的發展。然而日本政權禁止基督教會以及其他宗教向原住民傳教，在其「理蕃政策」框架下試圖以日本的佛教與神道教的傳播同化原住民，達到有效治理的目標。有學者指出，自 1895年後，日本成為亞洲惟一的殖民國家，殖民經驗的不足，使日本思考與仿傚過去西方荷、英等殖民國家的殖民經驗，宗教上的殖民效用遂受重視。佛教與殖民的合作由淨土宗、曹洞宗開始，在隨軍佈教的情形下，一些佈教使曾於各蕃界內佈教。其後在日本政府支持下，蕃地的佈道工作以真宗本願寺派為主（范純武 1999：255）。日本政府除了藉已然為台灣熟悉的佛教諸派以外為合作對象以外，尤其運用本身的國教神道教宣傳愛國意識並予以征服，因其不獨是宗教且為日本國族與皇室象徵，主張效忠皇室、拜祭皇室祖先。日本政府在山地廣設神社，強迫膜拜，其他宗教宣傳一概被禁止（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：206、365）。在此情況下，原住民傳統宗教受到明顯削弱，各種祭典傳統被禁絕。教會在台灣從二十世紀初即積極籌劃進入山地傳教，但都遭到禁止，傳教工作無法開展。但其中有部分山地原住民在外接觸基督教，成為山地傳教先驅，如姬望、許南免、高添旺、打歪等人（林金水2003：268-269）。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was little organized resistance to Christianity at this time, the key word here being organized. Rather, resistance to Christianity came from a variety of sources, nearly ubiquitous but generally small in scale. Missionary sources mention a handful of political officials as being particularly and often violently anti-Christian. \n\n\nThe most notable case of official persecution was in the northern town of Hulan, where missionary Louis Conraux was captured and tortured by local officials during the 1880s. (I believe this was in connection to the Zaili revolt). This area would later (post-Boxer) become a Christian stronghold. In another earlier case from 1888 the Catholic orphanage near Haicheng was attacked, the two missionaries driven out “with rifles and lances” and 25 of the 53 children killed.\n\n\nHowever, while some such officials were indeed motivated by dislike of foreigners of Christians, others had no particular thought beyond preventing the outbreak of violence against the foreigners who after 1871 were increasingly willing to take up matters with the foreign legations. Facing fears of a Russian invasion, one such official in “San-sing” (in “Amur” province, assume they mean Heilongjiang) imprisoned local Christians to convince them to recant their faith. When that was unsuccessful, he ordered them to leave, even offering to recompense them for lost lands. When the Christians replied that they would leave only in response to an official decree, the official wrote one and ordered soldiers to banish any Christian from the territory, and to punish anyone caught harboring or selling land to a Christian. (Guillon 1891).\n\n\nOf particular note is that clerical (Buddhist and Daoist) religions did not seem to be particularly anti-Christian, at least not consistently or as a matter of principle. Protestant sources report that Muslims tended to be more friendly to the missionaries, for example being willing to engage in commerce when Han Chinese would not.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in question 3, most anti-Christian activity during this decade should be sourced to or channeled through the Boxers, including small bursts of violence that took place years after the fact.  As such, the Boxers themselves are the umbrella for the period, but who are they? Mission sources emphasize the frequent two-way migration between southern Manchuria and Shandong/Zhili, meaning that anything happening on the North China Plain would quickly be brought north. Other religious movements were known to travel this route, such as the anti-Christian Zaili rebellion that erupted in Rehe in 1890.\n\n\nPolitical support for the Boxers in Manchuria is difficult to pin down, in part because the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5 had already weakened the chain of military and civil command across the region. Troops are shown acting in conjunction with the Boxers, or at least not opposing them, but I cannot say for certain if that represents orders or a breakdown of discipline. Later events are more clearly attributed to hostile local officials who took the opportunity to “remove the mask” of civility and openly attack the Christians.\n\n\nThe aftermath of the Boxers saw a general decrease in anti-Christian activity, if not sentiment, since small-scale events recurred over the remainder of the decade. Sources describe these as being the work either of former Boxers, abetted by hostile local officials, or by similar groups “secret societies and Boxers in all but name” who were motivated either by old grievances or the desire for plunder. \n\n\nOn the whole, I would characterize the shifting and inchoate anti-Christian sentiment of the period as more mood than movement, and certainly nothing that could be definitively tied to a movement or individual.\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated, there was no mention in the sources of an organized anti-Christian movement. There were, however concerns that such a movement could develop over time. In the eyes of mission writers, this future threat would come from one of three sources:1. Energized Guomindang governance:\n\nCatholic sources from this decade contain passing mentions about the “spirit of independence” growing among catechists, as well wariness of anti-foreign / anti-Christian sentiments from local officials (anecdotally, these officials often seem to come from the South, including in previous periods) \n\n\nAlthough less frequent or violent than those further south, outbreaks of anti-foreign sentiment were often precipitated by events elsewhere, such as the 1925 shooting of protesters in Shanghai. The Protestant Synod in Shanghai offered to relinquish extraterritorial rights for its missionaries, and the Manchuria mission issued a statement in sympathy with the protesters and Chinese national aspirations. In 1927, local authorities banned any new construction of a school, church or dispensary. In 1931, they forced the closure of the Catholic Franco-Chinese College, which had around one hundred students in Shenyang. This school had been the site of significant nationalist agitation.\n\n\n2. Communism:\n\nThere is some concern of Communism, either in the form of hostility from the Soviet Union or infiltration from the South. Notably, the latter is associated (in the sources) with radical elements in the Guomindang, and secondarily with Sun Yat-sen’s sanmin zhuyi ideology.\n\n\n3. Public disorder:\n\nThe most consistently-mentioned threat was the lack of order. Fed by demobilized or deserter troops, gangs of bandits controlled large swathes of countryside, attacking travelers and occasionally villages. Foreigners and Christians were singled out the extent that they were perceived as a high-value target, rather than being driven by anti-foreign sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not a movement as such, there were both Japanese and Chinese anti-foreign elements in the government of Manchukuo. Generally, these voices perceived Christianity as a recalcitrant bastion of foreign imperialism. Japanese critics were naturally influenced by what was happening in Japan, such as the shrine controversy at Sophia University (a group of student refused to attend ceremonies at the Yasukuni Shrine) However, these are mentioned in very general terms as “conservatives” but were never significant enough to be tied to any individual, much less an identified faction. The Chinese voices were more muted, as the most strident nationalist cultural defenders (and proponents of ideology such as sanmin zhuyi) had more or less been evicted at the creation of the new state. \n\n\nOf the two, the Protestants were viewed with greater suspicion, both because many of the missionaries were British and because Protestant Christians had been active in opposing Japan in Korea (1919) and at least some of the Korean migrants to Manchuria were suspected to have been refugees from that suppression. Already under pressure from the previous decade of rising Chinese nationalism, Protestant educational institutions were cast under even greater suspicion. All schools were forced to replace portraits of Sun Yat-sen with those of the Manchukuo and Japanese emperors. The Protestants were the more vociferous (at least in their internal publications) in their opposition to such policies, but also realized that they were powerless to resist. Sources also describe constant surveillance, summary searches, the constant threat of arrest (for foreigners—Chinese Christians were simply arrested), and occasional rumors that (not wishing to display the same weakness that had allowed the Korean revolt to develop) all Christians were to be executed. In all, the Protestants during this decade seemed to take the tactic of laying low and hoping that the storm would pass. \n\n\nThe Catholics were viewed as more willing partners. This comes in part from the long history of the MEP in Japan (including support during Japan’s continental wars), support from well-placed Japanese Catholics, the fact that most MEP were French (and less antagonistic to Japan) and the work of people like Gaspais to actively court a place for Catholics within the new state. Yet even the Catholics were not free of suspicion. In their private correspondence, the small contingent of American Maryknoll priests noted that they were under constant and not always well-intentioned observation. \n\n\nYet, many among the Japanese leadership saw common cause with the Christians (again, the Catholics especially) as a bulwark against communism and sanmin zhuyi ideology (the two were often equated in the sources). This is in addition to sympathetic Japanese Catholics acting behind the scenes in Tokyo or Xinjing. \n\n\nJapanese-sponsored social/religious groups such as the Red Swastika Society and Concordia Society had a similarly double face, supporting the Christians to the degree that they could be made to fit into the carefully-engineered structure of religion as an expression of Manchukuo national unity, but drawing the boundary at foreign mission (especially Anglo-American Protestants). These were semi-independent organizations that were staffed largely by “true believers” in the Manchukuo project and most often high-ranking members of that government. As such, they mirrored directly state initiatives and rhetoric. \n\n\nOfficially, Christians were one of a few approved religious organizations, similar to the later status of “patriotic” churches in China. Propaganda events featuring religion as an expression of national unity would feature a Catholic priest (usually Gaspais), along with an imam and Buddhist monk (others might be included – the structure was not as normative as the “five religions” in China). I have not seen Protestants participating in these events before or after 1939.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunists \n\n### Section: Anti-Christian Events/Movements (including competing events/movements against Christianity)\n\n\nAnti-Christian Sentiment and the Massacre of Christians During the Korean War\n\n\nDuring the Korean War (1950–1953), anti-Christian sentiment spread across the peninsula, leading to widespread and systematic massacres of Christians. These massacres were not merely acts of religious persecution, but were deeply rooted in political and ideological conflicts, especially within the Cold War bipolar framework. The logic of ideological camps (anti-communist vs. pro-communist) served to justify violence, and Christianity, being affiliated with the pro-American, capitalist, and anti-communist bloc, became a major target for the North Korean regime and its allies.\n\nChristianity in South Korea was closely aligned with anti-communist ideology and was supported by the U.S. military government and Syngman Rhee's administration. In the eyes of the North Korean regime and leftist forces, Christianity symbolized imperialism and ideological opposition. Thus, Christians were branded as reactionaries, imperialist agents, or enemies of the people.\n\nIn areas occupied by the North Korean army, Christian pastors, evangelists, and their families were often targeted. The classification of individuals as collaborators, reactionaries, or enemies was often arbitrary. Massacres were executed based on vague accusations or religious affiliation alone. In some areas, massacres occurred in waves: first by North Korean forces, and then again by South Korean forces after recapturing territories. This created a 'double massacre structure' in which civilians were victimized by both sides under different political labels. This double massacre structure was particularly evident in regions like Songak-myeon. Initially, during North Korean occupation, Christians and right-wing figures were executed. Later, when South Korean forces regained control, revenge killings occurred against those who had collaborated with the previous regime or were simply suspected of sympathies. This vicious cycle of retribution demonstrates the blurred lines between victim and perpetrator and illustrates the tragic entanglement of ideology and religion.\n\nThe anti-Christian movement was rooted not in pure religious animosity, but in a broader ideological campaign to eliminate perceived threats to the socialist regime. Christians, especially in leadership roles, were seen as agents of Western influence and moral opposition to the state ideology. However, not all Christians responded with partisanship. Figures like Sohn Yang-won, Seo Ki-hoon, and Kang Sung-gap chose the path of non-violence, forgiveness, and love. They refused to dehumanize their enemies and instead lived according to Gospel principles. Their martyrdom stands in contrast to the cycle of violence and offers a path toward reconciliation.\n\nThe massacres of Christians during the Korean War should not be understood solely as religious persecution but as a complex result of Cold War politics, ideological polarization, and internalized cultural dualism. Christianity in Korea was both a victim and, at times, an enabler of this violence. Yet, amidst the devastation, some individuals embodied the true essence of their faith, offering hope for peace and reconciliation.\n\n\nTable 5.

Amidst the destruction of homes, institutional collapse, and massive displacement, people turned to religion for hope and stability. As traditional Protestant denominations became entangled in doctrinal disputes and institutional fragmentation, new forms of Christian spirituality emerged that emphasized mysticism, charismatic leaders, communal living, and eschatological visions. The most prominent examples from this era are Park Tae-seon’s Evangelical Tabernacle (Jeondogwan), Na Un-mong’s Yongmunsan Prayer Retreat, and Moon Sun-myung’s Unification Church.\n\nPark Tae-seon proclaimed himself “the Righteous Man of the East” and founded Jeondogwan in 1955. Through a ritual called ‘anchal’ (faith healing by touch), he claimed to heal the sick and purify the body. His followers revered him as a messianic figure. Park established a self-sufficient religious community called Sion Village (Shinangchon) in Bucheon, which functioned as a semi-autonomous society. Over time, he even declared himself to be the new God, which led to increasing criticism and alienation from mainstream churches and the public.\n\nSimultaneously, Na Un-mong’s Yongmunsan Prayer Retreat emerged as a major center of charismatic spirituality. The retreat hosted intensive prayer sessions that involved fasting, night vigils, glossolalia, and visions. Na was described as a “spiritual scientist,” and the prayer mountain became a place where collective fear and anxiety were transformed into intense spiritual experiences. Na also initiated national salvation prayer movements and influenced Korean Christian spiritual practices beyond his retreat.\n\nAnother influential figure was Moon Sun-myung, who founded the Unification Church (World Christian Gospel Mission) in Busan in 1954. He claimed to be the new messiah sent to complete the failed mission of Jesus. According to the church's central text, “Divine Principle,” Jesus' death on the cross did not fulfill God’s plan, and Moon would succeed by restoring humanity through “true parenthood” and the purification of bloodlines via “blessing marriages.” The Unification Church expanded rapidly by targeting youth and intellectuals, especially in elite universities such as Ewha Womans University and Yonsei University. The 1955 Ewha scandal, in which faculty and students were revealed to be involved with the church, caused national controversy. Despite fierce opposition from mainstream Christian denominations, the Unification Church expanded internationally and developed powerful media and political networks.\n\nThese new religious movements cannot be viewed merely as heresies but as social phenomena rooted in historical trauma. They offered direct spiritual experiences, charismatic leadership, communal belonging, and eschatological hope at a time when institutional religion failed to meet the people's emotional and existential needs. The emergence of prayer mountains, communal villages, and messianic figures reflected a deep hunger for healing, salvation, and a new world order. The 1950s was thus one of the most spiritually dynamic and turbulent decades in Korean religious history.\n\n\nTable 6.

Their sacrifices left an indelible mark on the Korean Catholic Church and its followers.\n\nOne prominent figure was Bishop Patrick James Byrne, an American Maryknoll missionary who served as the Apostolic Delegate to Korea. In 1950, as North Korean forces advanced into Seoul, Bishop Byrne was apprehended and subjected to the notorious \"death march\" towards the northern regions. Enduring harsh conditions, he succumbed to exhaustion and illness on November 25, 1950. His unwavering commitment to his faith and the Korean people was evident in his decision to remain with his congregation despite escalating dangers. Another notable missionary was Monsignor Thomas F. Quinlan, an Irish priest and member of the Missionary Society of St. Columban. Serving as the Prefect Apostolic of Chuncheon, he was captured during the war and endured imprisonment under severe conditions. Despite these hardships, Monsignor Quinlan survived and continued his ecclesiastical duties post-war, exemplifying resilience and dedication.\n\nThe Columban Fathers, an Irish missionary society, faced significant losses during this tumultuous period. Father Anthony Collier, stationed in Chuncheon, was the first non-Korean killed during the war, meeting his end on June 27, 1950, at the hands of North Korean soldiers. Similarly, Father Patrick Brennan, serving as the Prefect Apostolic of Gwangju, was captured and later killed on September 24, 1950. Alongside him, Fathers Thomas Cusack and John O'Brien also met martyrdom, choosing to stay with their parishioners despite imminent threats. The sacrifices of these missionaries were not in vain. In recent years, the Korean Catholic Church has initiated processes to recognize and honor these individuals. In 2022, the bishops of South Korea advanced the cause for the canonization of 81 Catholics, including foreign missionaries, who were martyred during the Korean War. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of their sacrifices on the Korean Catholic community and the enduring legacy of their faith and commitment. \n\nThese narratives of sacrifice and unwavering faith amidst adversity highlight the profound commitment of Catholic missionaries during the Korean War. Their legacies continue to inspire and resonate within the global Catholic community.\n\n\nChristianity in North Korea\n\n\nChristianity in North Korea during the 1950s underwent a systematic and often violent transformation, shaped by ideological repression, war, and a deliberate campaign by the regime to dismantle religious life. The formation of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1946 by Kang Ryang-uk, Kim Il-sung’s uncle, marked the beginning of the state's efforts to co-opt Protestant leaders and align religious activities with socialist goals. Those who resisted were subjected to arrest, surveillance, or execution. In the immediate post-liberation period, North Korea housed between 2,000 and 3,000 Protestant churches, serving a community of approximately 300,000 believers, including 410 pastors, 498 evangelists, and 2,142 elders. By 1949, under growing state pressure, these numbers had declined sharply to an estimated 200,000 believers, with many churches closed or dismantled.\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 intensified these pressures. Protestants were often associated with American influence and were perceived as traitors. Christians who welcomed or cooperated with UN forces during temporary occupations of the North were branded as enemies of the state. Many were executed or imprisoned when North Korean forces, backed by China, reestablished control. Reports indicate that of the 410 ordained pastors active before the war, at least 350 were either killed or disappeared, with only 20 to 60 surviving. Church buildings became targets during U.S. bombings and also by North Korean authorities post-conflict, with over 500 out of 3,000 churches destroyed or repurposed. Public religious activity ceased, and only clandestine house churches remained, hidden in homes, mountains, or remote caves.\n\nFollowing the war, in December 1953, Kim Il-sung announced a new policy of ideological re-education aimed directly at religious youth. This marked the start of institutionalized atheism and systematic anti-religious campaigns. The 1955 directive 'On Intensifying Class Education' and the 1958 decision 'On the Mass Struggle Against Anti-Revolutionary Elements' formalized the state’s stance: Protestants were officially categorized within the 'hostile class' under the Songbun system. Between 1958 and 1960, approximately 450,000 people from 100,000 religious households were classified as reactionaries and forcibly relocated to remote areas such as North Hamgyong Province. The repression extended to every aspect of life, from employment and education to residence and social status. In schools, religious children were encouraged to report on their parents, and anti-religious propaganda films and literature were widely circulated. Christians were imprisoned, executed, or expelled, and even those with mere familial ties to Christianity faced discrimination and relocation.\n\nDespite the nearly complete destruction of public religious life, remnants of faith survived through underground gatherings and household worship. These secret congregations were small, often composed of family members, and met irregularly. Though limited in scope, they preserved core aspects of Protestant identity and practice, including prayer, hymn singing, and moral teachings. The persistence of these groups laid the foundation for the emergence of underground churches in the 1980s and 1990s. The regime's brutal efforts to erase Christianity during the 1950s were largely successful in suppressing institutional religion, but they failed to eliminate belief itself, which continued to circulate quietly within households across the country.\n\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the major characteristics of Christianity in North Korea during the 1950s:\n\n| Category | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Formal Christianity | Korean Christian Federation (KCF), used for propaganda |\n| --- | --- |\n| Actual Christianity | Underground or house churches, small gatherings in secret |\n| --- | --- |\n| Suppression Methods | Surveillance, job/education discrimination, executions, forced labor |\n| --- | --- |\n| Transformation | Traditional churches replaced by underground communities |\n| --- | --- |\n| International Context | Support for UN/US led to justification of persecution by North Korean regime |\n| --- | --- |\n\n\n\nThe Winter of Christianity in North Korea\n\n\nThe 1960s represented a stark nadir for Protestant Christianity in North Korea. While outwardly the religion seemed to have vanished, in reality, a remnant of faithful believers persisted underground. Jooseop Keum describes this era as “The Winter of Christianity in North Korea,” spanning from 1958 to 1972, when Christianity was virtually banned and violently suppressed by the Communist regime. \n\nAs Keum explains, “From 1958 to 1972, Christianity in North Korea was effectively outlawed under the Anti-Religious Campaign, leading to the near-total disappearance of public religious life.” This Anti-Religious Campaign was both ideological and institutional, aimed at eliminating all forms of religion—including Buddhism and Shamanism—but especially targeting Christianity as a perceived ideological rival to Juche.\n\nBackground: Political and Ideological Suppression The campaign officially began in 1958, after the Christian boycott of the 1957 local elections, which the regime interpreted as a challenge to Kim Il-sung’s authority. Keum notes that even a small act of nonconformity was sufficient to initiate broad suppression: “Although the boycott was carried on in only one county, it was enough stimulation for Kim Il-sung and his followers to oppress the Christians throughout North Korea.” The ideological foundations were articulated in publications like Jung Ha-cheol’s Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959), which defined religion as “the opium of the people… a fatalistic ideology that weakens revolutionary spirit.” By 1959, the Korean Workers' Party had published six anti-religious booklets, systematically targeting Christianity for its links to American imperialism, its support for South Korea during the war, and its obstruction of socialist reconstruction.\n\nChristian leaders and laypersons were arrested, executed, or sent to forced labor camps. Underground churches in Pyongan and Hwanghae provinces were raided. In 1968, for example, members of a house church in Onchun County were arrested and deported to mines. The most far-reaching tactic of the Anti-Religious Campaign was the resident reclassification program, which lasted from 1958 to 1969. Citizens were grouped into three main classes—core, basic, and hostile—and into 51 sub-categories. Christians were typically placed in Section 38, labeled for “special observation.” Even Christians who supported the state could not hold high-ranking positions. According to Keum, “The total number of Protestant Christians dropped from 50,000 in 1953 to around 5,000 by 1972,” a loss of 90%, much of which can be attributed to forced apostasy, exile, execution, or despair.\n\nDespite persecution, many believers remained faithful. Keum uses the biblical metaphor of Isaiah’s holy remnant to describe their endurance: “The Christians in the North are considered theologically, on an analogue with the ‘remnants’ in Isaiah, as a ‘holy seed’ for the revival and renewal of Christianity in North Korea.” Christians held clandestine gatherings in house churches, which were often composed of small groups of fewer than ten people. In Kaesong, laypeople divided into eastern, western, and northern districts and began gathering in homes as early as 1954. A particularly moving account comes from Elder Se-yong Kang, daughter of a martyred pastor, who said she continued attending prayer meetings during the campaign period. Many believers prayed alone, memorized scripture, and maintained faith without clergy or formal sacraments. “Hundreds of house groups met in homes, worshipped and studied the Bible together, without ministers,” Keum writes.\n\nIn 1972, following a constitutional revision that loosened restrictions on religious activity, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) resumed public operations. Pyongyang Theological Seminary was reopened, individual Christians were urged to register, and two historic churches—Bongsu Church and Chilgol Church—were restored. By 1988, the number of house churches had grown to 511. This movement, Keum argues, was not merely a political accommodation but part of a deeper theological shift: “The revival of Protestant Christianity in North Korea was not the result of a compromising accommodation with the Communist government, but the consequence of its effective articulation of a minjung-centered approach.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Korean Christian Federation and the Dual Structure of Christianity in North Korea\n\n\nThe reemergence of organized Protestant structures in 1970s North Korea was not a mere act of religious tolerance but a calculated maneuver by the regime to integrate religion within the ideological and institutional bounds of the socialist state. Central to this effort was the revitalization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1974 under the name “Central Committee of the Korean Christian Federation,” which served both as a surrogate ecclesiastical body and a political organ aligned with Juche-based governance.\n\nThe 1972 Socialist Constitution, while formally recognizing “freedom of religion,” encoded this freedom within a framework of Juche hegemony. Article 54 granted the right to believe or not to believe in religion, but only insofar as it did not “disturb the order of society.” In this context, the KCF became the regime’s sanctioned vehicle for religious expression, structured not to promote theological autonomy but to project an image of religious coexistence within a socialist order.\n\nDuring the 1970s and into the 1980s, the KCF underwent structural reorganization. By 1985, it had expanded its regional presence to 50 branch offices, up from 35 in 1981. Official statistics indicated there were about 12,000 to 14,000 Christians and approximately 20 ordained pastors, as well as 520 house churches—framed as legitimate worship spaces, yet under tight surveillance and regulation by the state. These house churches functioned irregularly and were often led not by ordained clergy but by laypersons trained or guided by the KCF.\n\nNew showpiece churches, most notably Bongsu Church (1988) and Chilgol Church (1989), were constructed in Pyongyang. These institutions were showcased to foreign visitors as evidence of religious tolerance. However, as Jooseop Keum notes, “the KCF was not merely a propaganda tool, but an apparatus of religious redefinition under Juche ideology, modeling a form of minjung-centered ecclesiology that reflected socialist ethics.” This “socialist Christianity” emphasized national unity, anti-imperialism, and social harmony over spiritual salvation or scriptural orthodoxy.\n\nDespite the presence of officially recognized churches, a parallel and clandestine network of underground Christian communities persisted. These believers rejected the regime’s tightly controlled religious institutions and instead maintained faith through secret worship—gathering in basements, mountains, abandoned mines, or family homes. Though state sources acknowledged 520 house churches, missionary groups and defectors estimated there were between 100 and 2,000 underground churches by the late 1980s, with up to 30,000 adherents. Religious activity beyond the bounds of the KCF was viewed as subversive. The North Korean Human Rights White Paper documented numerous cases of imprisonment, torture, and execution for faith-related activities. Reports suggest that between 15,000 and 200,000 individuals were incarcerated in political prison camps during this period for religious reasons.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s thus witnessed the consolidation of a dual structure of Christianity in North Korea: a state-managed, ideologically useful religious system designed for propaganda and diplomacy, and a resilient underground church grounded in genuine spiritual devotion. One was publicly visible; the other lived in shadow—sustained by whispered prayers, generational memory, and enduring resistance. As Seong Lim Noh observes, “in order to secure international legitimacy, the DPRK reformulated Protestantism as compatible with socialism, reinterpreting its ethical values—such as compassion and justice—as coinciding with socialist morality.”[6]\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korean Christianity in the 1980s\n\n\nThe 1980s marked a complex era for Christianity in North Korea, characterized not only by repression but also by a tactical reconfiguration of religious policy in response to international scrutiny. This period saw the regime simultaneously suppressing underground Christian communities while leveraging state-controlled religion for diplomatic purposes—creating a dual structure of religious life that endures today.\n\nIn 1980, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) initiated contact with the World Council of Churches (WCC), which signaled a strategic shift. The North Korean regime began to see religion—specifically Christianity—not just as a threat, but as a potential tool of international engagement. From 1981 to 1984, North Korean delegates attended ecumenical conferences in Vienna, Helsinki, and Dozan, where they raised human rights issues in South Korea and promoted narratives aligned with DPRK policy. These interactions were not signs of religious openness but carefully orchestrated diplomatic maneuvers.\n\nDomestically, the regime simultaneously revived the Pyongyang Seminary in 1974, placing it under KCF control. The seminary operated with about 10 students per cohort in a three-year program. “Pyongyang Seminary operates on a three-year cycle, with about ten students per class. Since its first graduates in 1974, over 100 have completed the program by 2002. Graduates were dispatched as evangelists to Bongsu and Chilgol churches, eventually receiving ordination. However, the curriculum emphasized loyalty to Kim Il Sung and Juche ideology over biblical theology, turning the institution into a mechanism of religious control rather than a true theological school.\n\nThis strategy was most visibly embodied in the construction of Bongsu Church, which officially opened on November 6, 1988. Built in preparation for the 1989 Pyongyang World Festival of Youth and Students, the church was intended to project an image of religious tolerance. A pastor involved in the building of Bongsu Church recalled: “Rehearsals were held the day before any foreign visitor arrived. The congregation and service were scripted ahead of time.” Attendees were handpicked Party loyalists, and sermons followed government-approved scripts. Bongsu Church functioned less as a space of worship and more as a religious stage for the benefit of foreign observers.\n\nReligious infrastructure was further expanded with the publication of home-use Bibles and hymnals in 1983. Although this appeared to reflect an easing of religious repression, it remained tightly controlled. In the early 1990s, about 10,000 copies of state-approved Bibles and hymnals were printed in cooperation with the United Bible Societies and distributed to Bongsu and Chilgol churches. “It is believed that some expressions in the Bible were altered to avoid conflict with Juche ideology.”\n\nNorth Korean hymnals, unlike those used in the South, featured only lyrics without musical notation and were based on pre-1945 songs. “They excluded emotionally expressive hymns or those reflecting South Korean theological trends.” This editorial choice reflected the regime’s discomfort with the emotive and potentially subversive power of Christian worship. Behind these officially sanctioned institutions, however, lay a persistent underground church. During the 1966–1969 nationwide classification campaign, over 20,000 Christian households (about 70,000 individuals) were forcibly relocated to remote mountainous and mining regions. There, underground believers organized clandestine worship—memorizing scripture, gathering in homes, and sharing faith in secret. By the mid-1980s, Pyongyang alone reportedly had at least 100 underground house churches, with approximately 1,000 registered believers, though unofficial estimates put the number of underground Christians at around 100,000. These communities often relied on charismatic experiences—healing, visions, tongues—as sources of spiritual authority. “Evangelism wouldn’t work without miracles,” one defector recalled.\n\nThe early 1980s also saw significant shifts in how underground Christians engaged with the state. In anticipation of the 6th Party Congress in 1980, the regime declared a partial amnesty for certain “hostile class” individuals, including former Christians. Some of these individuals returned from exile and rejoined clandestine church networks. KCF Secretary Ko Ki-jun stated in 1981 that “there are more than 500 places of worship nationwide,” suggesting that some level of house-church revival was occurring under strict surveillance.\n\nStill, this era was also marked by continued repression. According to the extensive documentation by Pastor Ban Suk Lee, at least 16,984 Christians were executed or imprisoned for their faith between 1945 and 2006, with 761 recorded cases, many occurring during the 1980s. Common offenses included possession of a Bible, leading secret services, or evangelizing—any of which could result in imprisonment, torture, or execution.\n\nIn the border regions of Ryanggang and North Hamgyong, the late 1980s saw the emergence of a second-generation underground movement. North Koreans who had encountered Christianity while in China returned and began organizing home worship among their families. Their faith was shaped by experiential theology—focused on dreams, healing, and prophecy. One defector recounted, “We hid the Bible under our pillows and prayed under blankets so no sound would escape. Those caught disappeared without a trace.” Accounts like these appear throughout defector testimonies and books such as More Thirsty Than Starving and Evangelism Means Death, reflecting the brutal risks of faith in North Korea during this time.\n\nIn summary, Christianity in 1980s North Korea operated under a paradoxical system: state-controlled religious institutions served propaganda purposes, while authentic Christian faith survived in the shadows through suffering and resilience. This dual structure—between ceremonial religion and persecuted faith—would shape North Korean religious policy into the 1990s and beyond, especially amid famine and growing international humanitarian engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristianity under Persecution in North Korea\n\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Christianity in North Korea existed under the most repressive ideological regime in East Asia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the onset of North Korea’s own economic disaster—known as the “Arduous March”—the government faced internal strain and international isolation. Within this context, religious belief, particularly Christianity, was considered fundamentally subversive. As Juche ideology continued to define the metaphysical and moral structure of North Korean society, Christians were systematically targeted as enemies of the revolution and as carriers of foreign influence.\n\nThe most immediate form of repression during this decade was the intensified persecution of underground churches. As famine and hardship forced tens of thousands of North Koreans across the border into China, many encountered Christian missionaries or Korean churches there. Some were converted and returned to North Korea, bringing with them Bibles and an underground evangelical fervor that spread primarily through family networks. However, this posed a direct threat to the ideological control of the state, and the government responded with violent suppression. Numerous cases have been documented in which Christians were arrested, tortured, publicly executed, or sent with their entire families to political prison camps such as Yodok.\n\nOne of the most chilling examples was the execution of a woman named Ri Hyeon-ok in 2009 (widely understood to reflect practices continuing from the 1990s). She was reportedly shot in public for distributing Bibles, while her family members were sent to a prison camp. Earlier, in 2006, a former North Korean army officer named Son Jong-nam was arrested for preaching Christianity. He was reportedly tortured in Pyongyang’s State Security Department detention center and died in 2008 from internal injuries sustained under interrogation. These incidents were not isolated but part of a broader pattern in which any expression of Christian faith—prayer, possession of a Bible, or even the act of singing hymns—was criminalized under charges of espionage or treason.\n\nThis climate of repression was underpinned by the regime’s view of Christianity as ideologically incompatible with Juche thought. While Kim Il-sung declared in his memoirs that Christian values of peace and harmony did not contradict his worldview, in practice, the state emphasized absolute loyalty to the “Suryong” (Leader) and framed Christianity as a foreign-born ideology that disrupted national unity.⁵ The philosophical and theological conflict between the transcendental God of Christianity and the deified image of the Kim dynasty was irreconcilable in the state’s cultural policy.\n\nDespite the brutal crackdown on unofficial religious life, the North Korean government maintained the appearance of religious tolerance for external audiences. State-controlled institutions like the Korean Christian Federation (KCF), Bongsu Church, and Changchung Catholic Cathedral were revitalized or built during the late 1980s and showcased throughout the 1990s as evidence of religious freedom. These were, however, under strict surveillance by the Ministry of State Security. Services were often choreographed for visiting delegations from the World Council of Churches or South Korean religious representatives. Former defectors and researchers have noted that congregants were often selected party members, and sermons carefully scripted.\n\nWithin North Korean society itself, anyone with a Christian family background was stigmatized. According to the country’s “songbun” classification system, descendants of Christian families were labeled as “impure” and denied access to higher education, residence in Pyongyang, or Party membership. This form of inherited guilt functioned as a long-term mechanism of religious repression, ensuring the containment of Christianity not only as a faith but as a social identity.\n\nNevertheless, even in these dire conditions, Christianity did not disappear. Hidden worship continued in small domestic gatherings. Families passed down prayers and scriptures in secret. The number of active underground believers may have remained small, but their survival testifies to a faith resilient under extreme duress. Scholars and defector testimonies suggest that Christian households persisted by integrating faith into intimate kin networks and preserving oral traditions. This invisible church—distinct from the state-sponsored KCF—remained deeply rooted in both theological conviction and political defiance.\n\nIn summary, the 1990s marked a paradoxical decade for North Korean Christianity: a time of brutal suppression and quiet endurance. While state ideology portrayed religion as a relic of the past and a threat to national security, underground believers risked their lives to worship. Their existence stood as a form of spiritual resistance, one that the regime could suppress but never entirely erase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, there were no prominent anti-Christian incidents.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教事件\n\n### (1) **Conflict Between Evangelism and Traditional Culture in the New Territories**  \n\n(Lu Pui-Yee 2009)\n\n\nAfter the establishment of the **New Territories Evangelization Society**, the mission inevitably encountered resistance from traditional village religious cultures during its evangelistic efforts. For example, the 1910 annual report mentioned significant challenges faced by missionaries preaching in Sheung Shui. In one village, a family that chose to convert to Christianity was ostracized by other villagers. The father and son of the family were unable to sustain their livelihood within the village.\n\n\nThe 1912 report further noted that there remained strong opposition to Christianity in the villages of Sheung Shui. A colporteur who traveled around Yuen Long distributing religious books, along with his family, was driven out by villagers. The house they lived in was even barricaded.\n\n\nLater, tensions arose between the New Territories Evangelization Society and villagers in Tsuen Wan. At the time, not every household owned weighing tools for goods, so public scales were provided for villagers to weigh items such as pineapples and pork. Villagers paid a fee for this service, and the collected funds were used to maintain local temples. However, some villagers who converted to Christianity objected to their money being used to repair what they considered \"pagan\" temples and refused to pay the fees. This refusal sparked dissatisfaction and led to boycotts by other villagers.\n\n\nThe tensions and conflicts between the New Territories Evangelization Society and traditional village society illustrate the inevitable challenges faced by Christianity as it sought to spread within Chinese communities.\n\n\n(1)新界宣教與傳統文化的衝突（盧佩儀2009）\n\n\n新界傳道會成立後，在新界地區宣教過程中，難免會受到鄉村傳統宗教文化的排斥。例如在1910年的年報中，曾提及及傳教士在上水傳福音遇到相當的困難。在他們接觸的村落中，有一家庭因着願意成為基督徒，導致整個家庭遭到其他村民的杯葛，家庭中的父親和兒子，不能在村內繼續維持生計。1912年的報告再提及在上水的村落裏，仍然有強烈反對基督教信仰的氣氛。有一位在元朗到處傳教的派聖書員，他及其家人被村民驅趕，他們所居住的屋甚至被封鎖。\n\n\n後來，新界傳道會在荃灣又與村民發生張力。當時不是每家每戶都有秤貨物的工具，所以村內設置公秤為村民秤菠蘿及豬肉等物品，然後向村民收取金錢，所收取的金錢是用作維修寺廟之用。及後，有皈信了基督教的村民，不滿那些金錢用作維修所謂異教的廟宇時，他們拒絕付錢，因此便惹來其他村民的不滿，引起杯葛行動。\n\n\n新界傳道會與傳統社會間的張力與矛盾，可說是基督教在華人社會傳播時，必然面對的挑戰。\n\n(1) Responses to the Confucian National Religion Proposal  \n\nReferences: Wu Changxing (2015); Zhu Xiulian (2004); Goossaert & Palmer (2011: 43-66)  \n\n\nOn February 8, 1917, the National Affairs Report (Guo Shi Bao), published by the Confucian Society of Hong Kong, strongly advocated for Confucianism to be established as the national religion and criticized Christianity. Members of Hong Kong's Christian community urged Zhang Yijing to refute these claims in The Great Light Daily. Zhang temporarily postponed the preparation of The Great Light Weekly to engage in a written debate, publishing a series of articles countering the National Affairs Report. This debate lasted over a month, concluding on March 14. The articles were later compiled into a collection titled Great Light Breaks the Darkness, published by The Great Light Daily in 1919.  \n\n\nThe title Great Light Breaks the Darkness reflected Zhang’s perspective: the “great light” symbolized the enlightenment brought to people living in darkness, while “breaking the darkness” referred to exposing the fallacies of the national religion argument.  \n\n\nThe debate centered on the Confucian Society's proposal to establish Confucianism as the national religion, an idea initially suggested by Kang Youwei in 1898. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Chen Huanzhang and others in Shanghai founded the Confucian Society to reignite this movement, receiving support from Yuan Shikai, who sought to restore the monarchy. Even after Yuan’s death, the campaign continued, targeting Christianity as a major obstacle to Confucianism’s national prominence. The society argued that every new Christian in China signaled a step toward national decline and claimed that only by adopting Confucianism as the national religion could China achieve prosperity.  \n\n\nIn his rebuttal, Zhang Yijing emphasized the principle of religious freedom, asserting that a state religion violated constitutional guarantees. He clarified that opposing a state religion was not equivalent to opposing Confucianism itself. Zhang further argued that promoting one religion above all others would insult other faiths and could lead to the eventual eradication of Christianity. He warned that a national religion would result in the merging of religion and politics, undermining the principle of separation between church and state.  \n\n\nOn March 13, the National Affairs Report published a critique of Zhang Yijing’s views, to which Zhang responded the following day. The Confucian Society did not issue further rebuttals, marking the end of the month-long debate.  \n\n\nIn May 1917, the National Assembly convened a constitutional meeting, affirming the principle that “citizens of the Republic of China have the freedom to revere Confucius and practice religion, subject to no restrictions except by law.” The proposal to establish Confucianism as the national religion failed to secure the required two-thirds majority in the legislature, bringing the controversy to a close.  \n\n\nAlthough Hong Kong was a British colony, Zhang Yijing’s defense of Christianity during this anti-national religion movement demonstrated the significant role Hong Kong Christians played in shaping the broader debate.  \n\n\n(1)對孔教國教化的回應（吳昶興2015；朱秀蓮2004；Goossaert & Palmer 2011:43-66 ）\n\n\n1917年2月8日香港孔教會的《國是報》刊文，力倡立孔教為國教之餘，又批判基督教。香港教會中人希望張亦鏡能撰文駁斥，刊於《大光報》上。於是張亦鏡乃暫時擱置《大光週刊》的籌備工作，連接撰文駁斥《國是報》，展開近一個多月（至3月14日止）的筆戰。有關文章，後再刊於《大光週刊》，最後刊輯成《大光破暗集》，由香港大光報社於1919年出版。張亦鏡以「大光」作書名，意為「處暗之民獲見大光大義」，至於「破暗」，則為國教論的謬誤。\n\n\n論爭的一方，是孔教會提出孔教國教化，有關將孔教列作國教，早於1898年即由康有為提出。民國成立後，陳煥章等在上海籌創孔教會，再次推動孔教國教化運動，並獲主張帝制復辟的袁世凱支持。即使在袁逝世後，孔教國教運動仍在持續，並將矛頭指向基督教，認為基督教「中華歸主」的任務，乃孔教國教化最大的阻力。又指「中國多一信外教之人，即中國衰亡多一分」，唯有立孔教為國教，國家才可富強。「保教即保國，保國先保教」。針對孔教國教化，張亦鏡以「信教自由」作回應，認為國教違反憲法賦予信教自由的原則，並重申「反對國教」不等於「反對孔教」。相反，主張國教者卻侮辱其他宗教，一旦立為國教，他日更會基督教趕盡殺絕。同時，張又指出，「國教」會導致「政教合一」，有違「政教分離」之意。3月13日，《國是報》刊文批評張亦鏡，張在翌日撰文回應後，孔教會再沒有反駁文章。雙方持續三十多天的筆戰，由是劃上句號。\n\n\n1917年5月，國會制憲會議召開，確立「中華民國人民有尊崇孔子及信仰宗教之自由，非依法律不受制限；孔教會倡立國教的動議，亦未獲議會三分二成員支持。」，為國教爭議告一段落。雖然香港是英國殖民地，但在這場反國教運動中，藉張亦鏡的「辯道」，也發揮了重要角色。\n\n\n\nAccording to the text above\n\n參上文\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, there were no significant anti-Christian incidents or movements.\n\n此十年間未有明顯的反基督教事件/運動\n\n\n\n(1) The St. Stephen’s College Massacre (Banham 2003: 248-276; Chen Tianquan 2024: 100-103)\n\nSt. Stephen’s College was founded in 1903 by the Anglican Church in Sai Ying Pun. In 1928, the school relocated to Stanley, with its new campus situated on the site of the former Stanley Barracks. During the Battle of Hong Kong and the subsequent occupation, St. Stephen’s College became a significant chapter in this tumultuous history.\n\nOn December 22, British forces retreated to Stanley, fighting bitterly until December 25, when the defensive line fell. In the early hours of Christmas Day, Japanese forces stormed St. Stephen’s College. Despite the building displaying the Red Cross flag, the Japanese troops massacred over 60 wounded soldiers and medical staff inside. Female nurses were subjected to horrific assaults, including rape. Among the victims was Tan Cheung-Hsuen, the Head of the Chinese Language Department, an alumnus of the school who had enrolled at the University of Hong Kong in 1918, attended the World’s Student Christian Federation Conference in Beijing in 1922, and began teaching at St. Stephen’s in 1924. Remaining at the school during the war, he was brutally killed at the age of 41. His body was initially buried in Stanley Village and later reinterred in the Stanley Military Cemetery after the war.\n\n\n(2) The Reverend Chang Chu-Ling “Spy” Case (Chen Zhiheng 1999: 208-223)\n\nReverend Chang Chu-Ling was the senior pastor of the Union Church of the Chinese Christian Church. From May 1942 to March 1945, Japanese military police conducted 15 investigations into the Union Church, focusing on its history, financial assets, congregation size, and leadership. On October 21, 1943, a secret agent summoned Reverend Chang to the Western District Gendarmerie for questioning. Though this was not his first summons, this time he was detained and accused of being a spy for the Chongqing Nationalist Government.\n\nDuring his 19-day imprisonment, Chang was interrogated 11 times and subjected to severe torture, including beatings, being suspended upside down, whipped with thick belts, and deprived of water for over 30 hours. Facing such torment, he relied on prayer for strength.\n\nAfter Reverend Chang’s disappearance, the General Assembly’s advisor, Pastor Sawajima, sought his whereabouts and negotiated with Colonel Noma, the head of the Japanese military police. Chang later recounted that he was suspected of being an Anglo-American spy due to his fiery sermons, criticism of Japan’s hostile mindset, and frequent preaching of the gospel of peace, which was perceived as opposition to the “holy war.” He was also suspected of assisting people in returning to their hometowns. Even after his release, the Union Church remained under investigation. Chang required over 20 days of treatment to recover, though his hands, damaged from hanging, left him unable to fully extend his fingers. This pain persisted for years, particularly before storms.\n\nAt the time of his imprisonment, Reverend Chang was 66 years old. The ordeal inflicted lasting physical and mental trauma. He retired from the Union Church in September 1950 but continued to serve as an advisory pastor until his passing in 1961.\n\n\n(3) Christianity in Detention Camps (Ho Wing-Kei 2111: 179-194; Chen Zhiheng 1999: 313-338; Fetzer & Soper 2015)\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese army detained over 10,000 foreign nationals from “enemy countries” in various camps. Foreign Christians in Hong Kong were no exception. For example, the Stanley Internment Camp, located in the southern part of Hong Kong Island, housed approximately 2,400 British nationals, 300 Americans, and over 60 Dutch nationals. Among them were 40 pastors and missionaries from over 20 denominations, including the Anglican Church (from Britain, Ireland, Scotland, and the U.S.), Presbyterian Church (from Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.), Southern Baptist Convention, Salvation Army, Methodist Church, Lutheran Church, Seventh-Day Adventists, Assemblies of God, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Congregational Church, Religious Society of Friends, and Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn his memoir Too Hot for Comfort, British Methodist missionary Bill Ream recalled religious life in the Stanley Internment Camp. On January 25, 1942, the first Sunday worship service was held in the college hall. The morning and afternoon services were attended by over 300 and 100-200 people, respectively. In these harsh conditions, believers of various traditions united, with Free Church pastors assisting in Anglican Eucharist ceremonies and sermons delivered by pastors from different denominations. In addition to worship, the camp offered Sunday school for children and adults, later expanding to include youth services and teacher training programs. Morning prayers were held daily at 8:30 a.m., alternating between Anglican, Free Church, and litany prayers.\n\nSpecial gatherings were held on Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter. In September 1943, the camp hosted a week-long gospel campaign themed “Quo Vadis?” (“Where are you going?”). Bill Ream noted that, at the time, American and Canadian detainees were gradually repatriated, leaving those still interned uncertain about their future, making the theme especially poignant. In August 1944, a blackout prompted spontaneous gatherings in the camp, where believers shared scriptures and prayed together in the dark.\n\nHowever, unity was occasionally challenged. In April 1942, some American left-wing evangelicals insisted on holding separate services, which Ream described as a “traumatic experience.” While the religious services in the internment camp brought together different traditions, they did not constitute a formal “United Church” but rather “United Congregations.”\n\nThe altar for the joint worship services featured a golden cross that had once adorned the entrance of Mount Gough Peak Protestant Church (built in 1883), which was destroyed during the Battle of Hong Kong. Pastors carried the cross to the Stanley Internment Camp, and after the war, it was relocated to St. John’s Cathedral. In September 1958, on Michaelmas, the cross was presented to St. Stephen’s Church in Stanley, with an inscription commemorating its history.\n\nAdditionally, in a chapel at the Sham Shui Po Prisoner-of-War Camp, detainees created an altar using a box lid and a cross salvaged from a garbage heap. The altar bore the prayer of St. Richard of Chichester:\n\n\"Thanks be to my Lord Jesus Christ, for all the blessings Thou hast given me,For all the pains and insults Thou hast borne for me.O most merciful Redeemer, Friend, and Brother,May I know Thee more clearly, love Thee more dearly, and follow Thee more nearly, day by day. Amen.\"\n\nAfter the war, the altar was moved to the Chapel of St. Michael the Archangel in St. John’s Cathedral.\n\n\n(1)聖士提反書院大屠殺（Banham 2003: 248-276；陳天權2024：100-103）\n\n\n聖士提反書院於1903年由聖公會於西營盤創校。1928年遷至赤柱，新校址正是昔日赤柱軍營舊址。在香港保衛戰及淪陷期間，聖士提反書院成為這段不平凡歷史中的重要一章。\n\n\n12月22日，英軍退守赤柱，苦戰至12月25日防線失守。聖誕日凌晨，日軍攻入聖士提反書院，竟在已懸掛紅十字旗的書院大樓內屠殺傷兵及醫護六十多人，甚至有女護士慘遭日軍姦殺。其中聖士提反書院中文科主任譚長萱（該校校友，1918年入讀香港大學，1922年出席北京世界基督徒學生同盟大會，1924年起任教聖士提反書院），在戰爭期間留守學校，亦慘遭殺害，享年41歲。譚氏遺體葬於赤柱村內，戰後移葬至赤柱軍人墳場。\n\n\n(2) 張祝齡「間諜」案（陳智衡1999：208-223）\n\n\n張祝齡牧師是中華基督教會合一堂的主任牧師。自1942年5月至1945年3日間，日本憲兵合共調查合一堂達15次之多，調查內容涉及建堂歷史，財務資產、會友人數及領袖個人資料等。1943年10月21日，密偵到合一堂傳召張祝齡到西區憲兵部問話，這不是首次傳召，但結果張卻被羈留，並指他是重慶國民政府的間謀。在囚禁19天時間內，他被審問11次之多，並受到酷刑折磨（拳打腳踢、背手倒吊、高懸空際、以厚皮帶鞭打……），期間曾30多小時滴水不沾。面對獄中折磨，張只有依靠禱告。\n\n\n當張祝齡「失縱」後，總會顧問鮫島牧師四處查探，始得悉其下落，並跟憲兵最高負責人野間大佐交涉。關於張被日本憲兵扣查的原因，主要就是認定他是英美間諜，後來張自述：「平日講道，言辭激烈，有譏誚日本的敵性心意，而且常講和平的福音，有意反對聖戰，並且疑惑我暗助民眾還鄉」。獲釋後，憲兵仍多次調查合一堂，而張經過20多天治療，始漸康復。但手部因被倒吊，手指不能伸直，風雨前夕手筋作痛，持續多年。無論如何，張祝齡被囚時，已達66歲，事件無論如何對他亦構成身心創傷。1950年9月，張祝齡牧師自合一堂退休，仍任顧問牧師，1961年離世。\n\n\n(3) 拘留營中的基督教（何穎琪2111：179-194；陳智衡1999：313-338；Fetzer & Soper 2015）\n\n\n香港淪陷期間，日軍合共俘虜了一萬多名「敵國」外僑，分別送入各拘留營中。在港的外籍基督徒，也無一倖免。就以位於香港島南區的赤柱拘留營為例，扣留了大約有2400名英國人、300名美國人及60多名荷蘭人。其中包括40位牧師及傳道，基督徒背景涉及20多個宗派：聖公會（英國、愛爾蘭、蘇格蘭、美國）、長老會（愛爾蘭、紐西蘭、美國）、浸信會（美南、紐西蘭）、救世軍、衛理公會、路德會、循道會、安息日會、神召會、宣道會、公理會、公誼會、天主教等等。\n\n\n英國循道公會傳教士李惠霖（Bill Ream）在其回憶錄Too Hot for Comfort中，憶述赤柱拘留營內的宗教生活。1942年1月25日，書院禮堂舉行首次主日崇拜。早、午堂崇拜分別有300多人及100至200人出席在艱難環境下，不同宗派傳統信徒作出合一見證，如聖餐採用聖公會禮儀時，則由自由教會（Free Church）牧者襄禮，證道牧師亦由不同宗派牧師負責。除崇拜外，營內亦有兒童及成人主日學，後來發展出青少年崇拜，及主日學老師培訓班。每天早上八時半又有按聖公宗、自由教會、連禱文（Litany prayer）輪流舉行的晨禱會。\n\n\n聖誕節、受難節及復活節時，又有特別聚會。1943年9月，赤柱拘留營更舉行為期一周以「你往哪裡去？」（Quo Vadis?）為主題的福音運動。李惠霖指出，當時營內美加籍國民先後獲遣送回國，對仍然在囚者而言，看不到前面的路向，故有關主題有極大意義。1944年8月，拘留營整天停電，有信徒在晚上自發聚會，在黑暗中分享經文，一起禱告。不過，合一工作也受到挑戰。1942年4月，好些美國左翼福音派（left-wing evangelical）信徒堅持自行聚會，此舉被李惠霖形容為一次「創痛經驗」（traumatic experience）。扣留營內的宗教聚會雖然容納了不同宗派傳統，但嚴格而言，也不等同「聯合教會」（United Church），而只是聯合會眾 （United Congregations）。\n\n聯合崇拜聖壇有一金色十字架，原置於山頂教堂（Mt. Gough Peak Protestant Church, 1883）門廊頂。香港保衛戰期間，教堂遭日軍炸毀。教會牧者將十字架帶至赤柱拘留營。戰後，山頂教堂不擬重建，十字架移至聖約翰座堂。1958年9月米迦勒（Michaelmas）將此十字架送贈赤柱聖士提反堂（十字架後有刻文誌念）。\n\n\n此外，在深水埗集中營的小教堂內，戰俘用盒蓋及從垃圾堆中找到的十字架來製造可供崇拜的祭壇，祭壇上刻有聖理查 （Richard of Chichester） 的禱文：「感謝我的主耶穌基督，賜福給我並為我承受痛苦及侮辱。最滿有慈愛之救贖主，友⼈及弟兄，讓我更清楚認識你，更親切的愛你，更貼近地跟隨你，天天如是，阿⾨」──聖理查Richard of Chichester(1197 – 1253)。戰後，這本刻祭壇移至聖約翰座堂內的天使長聖米迦勒堂。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this decade, there were no significant anti-Christian events or movements.\n\n此十年間，未有顯著的反基督教事件/運動\n\n\n\n (1) Anti-Christian Movements During the 1967 Riots  \n\n(Hing 2018b: 76-81; Ying 2022: 7-47)  \n\n\nDuring the 1967 riots, Hong Kong’s churches were not directly targeted by protesters, and there were no organized campaigns against them. However, church-affiliated schools became a focal point. From June onward, students from numerous Catholic and Protestant schools were mobilized to form “struggle committees” or “combat teams.” Reports in Ta Kung Pao between May and December documented over 50 church schools whose students were involved to varying degrees in the red movement.  \n\n\nThe schools most affected included:  \n\n- Catholic Schools (21 schools): Notable examples were Kowloon Wah Yan College, St. Mary’s Canossian College, St. Joseph’s College, Sacred Heart Canossian College, La Salle College, and Maryknoll Convent School.  \n\n- Anglican Schools (10 schools): Schools included Bishop Hall Jubilee School, St. Stephen’s Girls’ College, St. Mark’s School, Diocesan Boys’ School, and Diocesan Girls’ School.  \n\n- Church of Christ in China Schools (6 schools): These included Ying Wa College, Ying Wa Girls’ School, and Hoh Fuk Tong College.  \n\n- Baptist and Tsung Tsin Schools (3 and 2 schools, respectively):  \n\nOther schools affiliated with Methodists, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, Lutherans, YMCA, and independent denominations were also implicated.  \n\n\nEven Christian higher education institutions, such as Hong Kong Baptist College and Chung Chi College, established struggle committees during the unrest.  \n\n\n Student Activities and Anti-Religious Sentiment  \n\nStruggle committees in church schools engaged in activities such as issuing statements, posting slogans, distributing leaflets, and even setting off firecrackers. Students from different schools often coordinated, participating in larger gatherings organized by the student struggle committee. On October 29, a united accusation assembly was held, specifically involving students and workers from church schools. At the assembly, attendees criticized church school administrators for “using religion to harm people,” claiming that “salvation does not come from Jesus or Mary, but from Mao Zedong Thought.”  \n\n\n Propaganda Through Youth Paradise  \n\nBefore the riots, the leftist literary publication Youth Paradise served as a covert platform for underground organizations to influence young people. During the riots, it became a tool for promoting leftist ideologies, calling for resistance against colonial rule and aligning students with patriotic and revolutionary values. The publication also featured anti-religious rhetoric.  \n\n\nFor instance, some church school students contributed articles to Youth Paradise that challenged religious beliefs. One writer dismissed God as a form of escapism, claiming that “revolutionary storms” required the rejection of “world-denying ideologies” to create a better future. From an atheistic perspective, another article accused religion of being a tool for exploitation and deception, describing theism as “superstitious” and “absurd.” Religion, the writer argued, served to numb people and divert them from class struggles, asserting that “the creator of the world is not God, but the glorious and sacred laborers.”  \n\n\n Marxist Critique of Religion and Its Application in Hong Kong  \n\nThe Marxist critique of religion was extensively employed during this period. Students linked Christianity in Hong Kong to colonial oppression, asserting that theology was used to perpetuate the ruling class’s agenda. They argued that Christian education indoctrinated students, portraying God as a tool of oppression and religion as a “poison” that exploited and enslaved the populace.  \n\n\nThis rhetoric mirrored the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) “cultural invasion” narrative, which criticized church schools as instruments of colonialism and sought to expose the supposed collusion between Christianity and imperialist powers. By targeting church-affiliated schools, leftist propaganda aimed to delegitimize Christianity as complicit in colonial exploitation while mobilizing youth to reject religious and colonial ideologies.  \n\n(1)六七暴動期間的反基督教運動（邢福增2018b：76-81；Ying 2022: 7-47）\n\n\n香港教會在六七暴動期間並未受到直接的示威群眾的衝擊，也未見有信徒有組織地發動針對教會的鬥爭。基督教界在暴動中衝當其衝的，卻是教會學校。但自6月起，為數不少的教會學校（天主教及基督教）的學生紛紛被動員起來，成立了鬥委會或戰鬥隊（小組）。5月至12月的《大公報》報導中，共有五十多所教會學校的學生在不同程度捲入了這場紅色風暴之中。「起義」的教會學校學生，以天主教最多（21所）、其次為聖公會（10所）、中華基督教會（6所）、浸信會（3所）及崇真會（2所），其餘的宗派尚有：循道、宣道、信義會、青年會及獨立宗派等。就以聖公會及中基督教會兩個較著名的基督教辦學團體為例，涉及的學校為：何明華會督銀禧中學、聖士提反女校、聖馬可中學、拔萃男校、拔萃女校、協恩女子中學、聖保羅男校、聖巴西流實用中學、聖保羅男女校（以上為聖公會）；基協實用中學、真光、英華男校、英華女校、何福堂書院、培英（以上為中華基督教會）。此外天主教的名校也有：九龍華仁、聖瑪利書院、聖約瑟書院、聖心、慈幼、喇沙、瑪利諾女校等等。除了教會中學外，浸會書院及崇基學院兩所具基督教背景的大專院校也先後成立了鬥委會。\n\n\n一般而言，各教會學校鬥委會或戰鬥小組成員主要在校內發表聲明，或張貼標語、散發傳單，甚至燃點爆竹。各校學生並不僅僅單獨行事，亦會聯合起來，參加學界鬥委會的控訴大會。10月29日，更有一場專門由教會學校學生及工人組成的聯合控訴會。除了港英殖民地政府外，與會者也指控校方「利用宗教害人」，表達出「能救他們的不是聖母耶穌，而是毛澤東思想」。\n\n\n在六七暴動前，香港左派以文藝刊物《青年樂園》作「灰線」掩飾，成為下黨組織接觸及影響青年學生的重要平台。而在暴動期間，《青樂》也成為左傾學生宣傳鬥爭的輿論工具，除散佈對殖民地社會及教育制度的批評外，也強化學生作為中國人身分的愛國情操，並對六七暴動的反英抗暴鬥爭，予以正面的價值，號召更多學生投入。其中，也涉及反宗教的政治論述。\n\n\n例如，有教會學校學生在《青年樂園》撰文，從個人層面質疑上帝，認為宗教只是「仰藥止痛」，面對「革命的風暴」，必須「革掉」這種「避世思想」，「為創造未來的世界而努力」。此外，又從無神論的角度，指「有人披著宗教的外衣，來剝削和欺騙人民」。又指「有神論」是「迷信」和「荒謬」，神的存在只具「麻醉」作用，「企圖引導人們離開階級鬥爭」。作者重申：「世界的創造者是人不是神」而是「光榮而神聖的勞動者」。可見，馬克思的宗教批判已成為廣泛運用的理論武器，明確指出批判宗教作為社會改造的鬥爭。抑有進者，有學生更進一步結合香港情況，指「今天的香港，神學也正配合了統治者的棍子向廣大居民下毒手」。許多學生「正身受這奴化教育之害」。「神」成為「統治者的工具」，是「欺騙人民，剝削壓迫人民」的「毒素」。批判的重心，已從是否有上帝存在，提升至剝削階級利用宗教來進行奴化及麻醉人民，矛頭直指香港的教會學校。顯然，這是中共最擅長的「文化侵略」論述，藉批判教會辦學，揭露基督教與殖民主義的勾結。\n\n\n\n\nThere were no notable events or movements opposing Christianity during this decade.\n\n此十年未有明顯的反對基督教事件/運動\n\n\n\n (1) The \"Xin Weisi\" Controversy on Church-State Separation (1986)  \n\n\nIn March 1986, a writer using the pseudonym \"Xin Weisi\" published a series of articles in the Ming Pao Freedom Forum, adopting a stance supportive of the Chinese government. Among these articles, Xin expressed his views on the Basic Law and religious freedom, criticizing the increasing politicization of Hong Kong churches and voicing concerns over \"church-state union\" (Xin Weisi 1986). He later expanded these ideas in articles titled Further Discussion on the Basic Law and Religious Freedom Parts I and II (Xin Weisi 1987).  \n\n\nDuring the consultation and drafting stages of the Basic Law, Xin advocated for the principle of church-state separation. He argued that religious groups \"should not participate in politics\" and that religious freedom should only encompass \"legitimate religious activities.\" Activities beyond this scope, particularly those involving \"church-state union\" or using religious platforms to undermine China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, should not be included. Citing Christianity’s historical ties to imperialism in China, Xin emphasized that the Chinese Constitution prohibits religious groups from being influenced by foreign powers. He argued that Hong Kong religious organizations should not interfere with China's religious policies, nor use the territory’s religious freedoms as a base for proselytization, recruiting believers, or forming secret religious organizations affiliated with foreign entities, as such actions would harm Hong Kong's religious institutions.  \n\n\nXin named specific Christian organizations, including the Christian Industrial Committee, the Tsuen Wan Ecumenical Social Service Center, the Hong Kong Christian Council, and the Catholic Social Communications Office. He also mentioned community organizations with indirect ties to Christianity, such as the Society for Community Organization and the Public Housing Tenants’ Association. He criticized their increasing politicization, particularly the Christian Industrial Committee's involvement in labor disputes, industrial issues, and socio-political events, positioning it as a cross-sector pressure group. Xin also highlighted the political engagement of church leaders such as Rev. Kwok Nai-Ho, General Secretary of the Hong Kong Christian Council, and Bishop Francis Hsu, Auxiliary Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, who had attended the High Hill Democratic Reform Conference to express opinions on constitutional reform.  \n\n\nXin's views, closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party’s position on religion and society, sparked significant responses from Christians. The Hong Kong Christian Watchmen Society provided a particularly strong rebuttal. Its theoretical group differentiated between various levels of church-state relationships: religion and politics, the church and politics, the government and religion, and the government and the church. They clarified that church-state separation pertains only to the institutional separation of churches and governments, not the disconnection of religion or churches from politics.  \n\n\nThe Watchmen Society argued that as faith communities practicing Christianity, churches are morally obligated to engage with political concerns. As civil organizations, churches also have the right to participate in lawful political activities. Thus, the principle of separation does not apply to the relationship between the church and politics. Xin’s conflation of these distinct concepts of church-state relations was seen as misleading.  \n\n\nAlthough Xin’s proposals were not included in any draft or final version of the Basic Law, his writings played a significant role in communicating the Chinese government's concerns about Hong Kong churches’ political engagement. Commentators have noted that Xin’s articles were a means to send a strong message, signaling Beijing's unease and dissatisfaction with the churches’ active participation in politics.  \n\n\nIt was widely speculated at the time that \"Xin Weisi\" represented a collective of writers from the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency. In 2003, with the founding of the pro-Beijing political party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) and Jasper Tsang Yok-Sing serving as its chairman, it was revealed that he was the author behind the pseudonym Xin Weisi.  \n\n(1)辛維思「政教分離」論爭1986（辛維思1986；1987；守望社理論組1987）\n\n\n1986年3月，有人以「辛維思」為筆名，於《明報》自由論壇發表大量文章，立場明顯傾向中國政府。其中，辛氏亦就基本法與宗教自由問題闡述他的觀點。他批評香港教會的政治化趨勢，表達了對「政教合一」的憂慮（辛維思1986）。後來他又發表了〈再談基本法與宗教自由〉（上）及（下），（辛維思1987）。\n\n\n當時正值基本法進行諮詢及起草階段，辛文主張基本法須確立「政教分離」原則，即宗教團體「不宜參與政治」。其所理解的宗教自由，只限於「合法的宗教活動」，「不應包括超越宗教活動以外的『政教合一』活動，當然也不應該包括借宗教活動來損害中國對香港行使主權的『自由』」。他特別提及基督教在歷史上與帝國主義侵華的關係，故中國憲法規定「宗教團體和宗教事務不受外國勢力的支配」。故此，香港的宗教組織不宜「干預中國在內地實行的宗教政策」，企圖以香港特區享有宗教自由來「攻擊中國政府的宗教政策」，或「以香港為基地，向內地人傳授教理、吸收信徒、甚至成立隸屬外國的宗教秘密組織」，這樣對香港宗教組織並「沒有好處」。\n\n\n辛文曾指名的基督宗教團體包括：基督教工業委員會、荃灣合一社會服務中心、基督教協進會、天主教社會傳播處，另與基督教關係較間接的社區組織協會及公屋評議會也包括在內。「這些以教會名義參與社會事務的團體便漸趨政治化。如基督教工業委員會，幾乎涉足於所有的工潮、工業事件、社會政治事件，成為跨越政、教、工業的壓力團體。另一方面，香港基督教協進會和天主教社會傳播處也經常組織基督徒議員的聚會，支持他們參政。」他又提及個別教職人士（特別是基督教協進會總幹事郭乃弘、天主教香港教區副主教曾慶文）出席民主政制高山大會，發表政制改革意見，反映出某些教職人士「希望教會作為一個整體直接參政」。\n\n\n查辛文的觀點，跟中共向來對宗教與社會關係的表述完全一致，其對政教分離的扭曲解釋，引起不少基督徒的回應，其中以基督徒香港守望社的反駁，最為有力。守望社理論組將「政」「教」關係區分為政治與宗教、政治與教會、政府與宗教、政府與教會四個不同層次，並指出政教分離的概念，僅指涉教會與政府在政制及權力來源上的分離，而非政治與宗教，或教會與政治的分離。就「政府」機構與「教會」組織的關係而言，政教是應該分離的。至於「教會」作為民間組織是否需要及是否有權利參與政治活動，理論組重申「教會作為實踐基督教信仰的群體，當然在責任上不能自絕於政治關懷的門外」，同時，教會作為民間組織，也具「權利」參與任何合法的政治活動。因此，分離的原則不適用於教會與政治的層面。辛文將不同概念的政教關係混淆，作出不必要的誤導。\n\n\n雖然辛維思的觀點並未見於基本法不同版本的討論稿及定稿內，但辛文的重要性及意義，其實並不是要將之納入基本法內，而是公開向香港教會傳達出中方的立場與憂慮，藉此影響香港教會往後對社會及政治議題的取態。有評論指出，辛文主要為中方「傳達一個強烈信息，表示他們對香港教會的積極參政深感憂慮和不滿」。\n\n\n當時許多人以為辛維思是中共駐港機構新華社香港分社的寫作班子，2003年底，香港左派成立政黨「民主建港聯盟」，馬力任主席，證實他就是辛維思。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Pastor Dennis Balcombe Deported by Henan Public Security in 1994  \n\n(Reported by Christian Times, 1994)  \n\n\nPastor Dennis Balcombe, Senior Pastor of the Revival Christian Church in Hong Kong, was detained by public security officials in Fangcheng County, Henan Province, during a visit to local believers in February 1994. On the early morning of February 11, he was taken into custody, along with two Hong Kong Chinese individuals, two Indonesians, and two Americans. The detainees were denied contact with their consulates and refused to sign any documents. On February 15, the authorities accused Pastor Balcombe of violating new regulations on religious activities for foreigners and expelled him from China, while the other detainees voluntarily departed for the airport. In addition, three Chinese believers were arrested in the incident.  \n\n\nFollowing the detentions, nine Christian and Catholic organizations in Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong Catholic Youth Council, Christian Concern for Hong Kong Society, Hong Kong Christian Students’ Movement, Hong Kong Christian Institute, Hong Kong Women Christian Association, Breakthrough Youth Development Center, Industrial Evangelistic Fellowship, Church Workers’ Fellowship, and the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee, issued a joint statement addressed to the Henan Public Security Bureau, expressing concern over the arrested believers.  \n\n\nThe new regulations cited by the Henan authorities refer to State Council Orders No. 144 and 145 of 1994: the Regulations on Religious Activities of Foreign Nationals in China and the Regulations on the Administration of Religious Activity Sites.  \n\n\nPastor Balcombe arrived in Hong Kong in 1969 and established a church in Sai Wan that emphasizes and seeks the fullness of the Holy Spirit. After 1978, he began engaging in missions in China, particularly forming close ties with the Fangcheng house church network in Henan.  \n\n\n---\n\n\n (2) Tianfeng Criticizes Hong Kong's Research on Y.T. Wu in 1997  \n\n(Tianfeng Commentator, 1997:6)  \n\n\nThe official publication of China’s Christian patriotic organizations, Tianfeng, published an article in its September 1997 issue titled “Mr. Wu Yaozong Must Not Be Slandered.” The article criticized Wu Yaozong’s Three Essays by Leung Ka-lun, published by the Centre for the Study of Christianity and Chinese Culture at the Alliance Bible Seminary in Hong Kong. It accused the book of “arbitrarily distorting Mr. Wu’s work,” “slandering and attacking the flagbearer of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, Mr. Wu,” and called for “serious criticism.”  \n\n\nLeung’s book, published in 1997, included three essays analyzing Wu’s contributions before and after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Among the points that drew criticism from Tianfeng were:  \n\n1. Leung’s assessment of Wu’s understanding of the relationship between Christianity and imperialism. Leung compared Wu’s writings from different periods and concluded that Wu’s later critique of imperialism’s use of Christianity to invade China was motivated by government directives, accusing Wu of “ignoring facts, fabricating charges, and defaming Christianity and Christians.” In contrast, Tianfeng argued that Wu’s thoughts “developed over time,” leading to a deeper understanding of imperialism’s aggression.  \n\n2. Leung not only criticized Wu’s “religious sentiments, morality, and character,” but also questioned the sincerity of those who praised Wu as honest. Tianfeng claimed that Leung’s accusations extended to “all of Wu’s followers, including the entire Three-Self Patriotic Movement,” creating an unprecedented scope of attack. The article described this as “not research, let alone theological research, but sheer invective and personal attacks.”  \n\n\nSince 1997 marked Hong Kong’s handover to China, the commentator concluded, “At a time when mainland and Hong Kong Chinese and China’s international friends were celebrating the peaceful return of Hong Kong to the motherland, hearing discordant voices from within Christianity is, at the very least, deeply regrettable.”  \n\n\nThe Alliance Bible Seminary and Leung did not respond directly to the criticism, nor did Tianfeng follow up on the matter, leaving it unresolved. However, the incident highlighted the existence of invisible boundaries in researching sensitive topics such as the evaluation of the Three-Self Movement and the relationship between Christianity and imperialism. In the same year, the Research Department of the China Christian Council excerpted content from three books published by the Centre for the Study of Christianity and Chinese Culture, including Studies on the Three-Self Movement in the 1950s, Rural Churches in China Since the Reform and Opening-up, and Church-State Relations in China Since the Reform and Opening-up, for internal distribution. It criticized these works for reflecting an overseas “critical and even slanderous stance towards the Three-Self Movement,” highlighting the tension between academic freedom and political realities. Meanwhile, certain ministries of the Alliance Bible Seminary in China were also affected and discontinued.  \n\n(1)包德寧牧師（Dennis Balcormbe被河南公安拘逐出境1994（時代論壇1994）\n\n\n香港復興教會（Revival Christian Church）主任牧師包德寧（Dennis Balcormbe）於1994年2月到河南省方城縣探訪信徒時，於2月11日凌晨被公安扣留。除他以外，尚有兩名香港華人、兩名印尼人及兩名美國人被捕。他們被拒絕與領使館聯絡，也拒絕在任何文件上簽名。2月15日，公安指包違反外國人及宗教活動的新法例而被驅逐出境，其他人則自行前往機場。事件中，有三名中國信徒同時被捕。後來9個基督教及天主教團體（香港天主教青年聯會、基督徒關懷香港學會、香港基督徒學生運動、香港基督徒學會、香嵻婦女基督徒協會、突破青少年發展中心社關組、工業福音團契、教會工作者協會、香港基督教工業委員會）發表聯署聲明予河南省公安局，關注被捕信徒的情況。\n\n\n河南當局所指的新法例，即1994年國務院144及145號令：《關於中華人民共和國境內外國人宗教活動管理規定》和《關於宗教活動場所管理條例》。\n\n\n包德寧於1969年來港，在西環建立教會，是一所重視及追求聖靈充滿的教會。1978年後，他開始到中國宣教，特別是與河南家庭教會方城團隊建立密切關係。\n\n\n(2)《天風》評論員批評香港有關吳耀宗研究1997（天風評論員1997：6）\n\n\n中國基督教愛國團體機關刊物《天風》，於1997年9月號發表「評論員」文章，題為〈吳耀宗先生不容誣蔑〉，批評香港建道神學院基督與中國文化研究中心出版《吳耀宗三論》（梁家麟著）一書，「對吳先生任意歪曲」，「對我內地基督教三自愛國運動運動的一面旗幟吳先生進行毀謗和人物攻擊」，必須作出「嚴肅的批評」。\n\n\n梁家麟著《吳耀宗三論》一書，於1997年出版，收入作者三篇對1949年中共建國前後吳耀宗的研究。其中引起《天風》批評的地方包括：（1）吳耀宗對基督教與帝國主義關係的理解，梁比較吳不同時期的文章，認為吳後來批評帝國主義利用基督教侵略中國，是為了完成政府交付的任務」，因此「妄顧事實，編造罪名，污蔑基督教及誣陷基督徒」。《天風》評論員則指吳的思想是「不斷發展的」，因而對帝國主義的侵略性「有了過去更深刻的認識」。（2）梁著不僅批評吳耀宗的「宗教情操和道德及其人格」，更進一步指出：「我甚難想像，那些稱讚吳耀宗為誠實的人，其本身如何是誠實的」。《天風》評論員認為：「作者把他的誣蔑、攻擊擴中到吳先生的一切追隨者，即整個三自愛國運動，其打擊面之大，實在令人難以想像」，並指出，「這就談不上是研究，更談不上是神學研究，而是十足的漫罵和人物攻擊了」。\n\n\n由於1997正是香港「回歸」年，因此評論員最後說：「當我們內地和香港的中國人以及全世界對華友好人士正在喜慶香港回歸祖國的祥和的日子裡，聽到來自基督教中的不協調的聲音，這至少可以說是令人深為遺憾的」。\n\n\n當時，建道及梁家麟方面沒有作正面回應，而《天風》也沒有後續的評論，事件暫告一段落。不過，事件突顯了中港兩地在研究敏感課題（如何評價三自運動，基督教與帝國主義的關係等）時存在無形的禁區。1997年，中國基督教兩會研究室摘錄了建道神學院基督教與中國文化研究中心出版的三本著作（《五十年代三自運動的研究》、《改革開放以來中國的農村教會》、《改革開放以來的中國政教關係》）的內容作傳達文件，指其中關於三自運動的觀點，反映海外「對三自運動進行研究，持批判以至污蔑態度的材料」，在在反映學術自由與現實政治間的張力。同時，建道神學院在中國的個別事工，亦受牽連而停止。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mwatau Massacre (麻豆事件, 1895) is related to the Sino-Japanese War and the Yì Wèi Anti-Japanese Movement. Local militia in Yunlin Douliu and Chiayi heard rumors that missionaries were acting as guides for the Japanese army. Enraged by this, they attacked churches in both areas. Churches in Shanlun, Dounan, and other places were also destroyed by angry mobs, and believers were besieged. In Damao (modern-day Jia Yi), a believer named Lin Tianding, along with two seekers and one Catholic, were falsely accused of assisting the Japanese army and were publicly executed by decapitation.\n\n\nOn October 9th, Japanese troops captured Chiayi, causing the militia to retreat to the Tainan area. The defeated militia informed the villagers of Mwatau in Tainan about the events near Chiayi, inciting them to take similar action. The villagers had long harbored resentment towards local missionaries, forcing them to flee to the mountains and leading to wanted posters being put up seeking information on their whereabouts. On October 14th, 20 Christians in Mwatau were killed for refusing to join the militia, falsely accused of colluding with the Japanese. According to the account of Reverend Barclay, 19 men and women were murdered by the mob, of which 4 were not Christians. The October edition of the \"Taiwan Prefectural City Church News\" listed the names of 21 deceased individuals, but two were later found to be alive and the list was corrected.\n\n\nAfter investigations, it was found that Liu Yongfu, a member of the Black Flag Army, was the mastermind behind the incident. He even wrote to the Tainan Prefecture and posted notices around the city urging the extermination of Christians to prevent future trouble.\n\n\nAfter Japan established its rule in Taiwan, relatives of the victims filed lawsuits seeking compensation. However, the Japanese authorities did not handle the matter properly, citing that the incident occurred before their formal rule over Taiwan. The Mwatau Incident not only stirred up anti-foreign sentiments in neighboring cities but also spread rumors in eastern churches about Christians colluding with the Japanese, leading to attacks on churches and believers.\n\n\nChristian communities not only faced incitement from militia forces but also suffered from false accusations by the Japanese army after they occupied various parts of Taiwan. Many Christians were arrested, detained, tortured, and killed, while churches in the northern regions were occupied by the Japanese army. The total number of killed and missing believers amounted to 735. Southern churches like the Dagou Church were also destroyed or burnt down by the Japanese army, leading the Tainan Missionary Association to seek compensation from the Japanese government.\n\n\n麻豆事件（Mwatau Massacre, 1895）。與甲午戰爭和乙未抗日運動有關，雲林斗六和嘉義地方義軍聽到傳聞宣教士為日軍作嚮導，因此憤而襲擊兩地教堂，沙崙、斗南等地教堂也被當地憤怒群眾搗毀，信徒遭到圍攻。打貓（今嘉義民雄）一名信徒林添丁和兩名慕道者、一名天主教徒四人被誣陷為協助日軍，遭到斬首示眾。日軍10月9日攻陷嘉義，義軍撤往台南地區。敗逃的義軍告知台南麻豆村民嘉義附近的事件，慫恿其起而效尤。村民早已仇視當地傳道人，迫使其躲進山區，以致村中張貼告示懸賞徵求通報其下落。10月14日，麻豆20名基督徒因不願參加義軍，被誣指暗通日軍而遭殺害，據巴克禮的說法，有19名男女被暴徒謀殺，其中4人不是基督徒，10月份128卷《台灣府城教會報》列出死者21人之名，但有兩人未死，後予以更正。經事後調查，事件主謀是劉永福黑旗軍部屬，其人甚至馳函台南府城並在城內四處張貼告示煽動剿滅基督徒以防後患（王政文2014：130-131；巴克禮2022：226-230）。日本在台統治確立後，受害者親屬提起告訴，要求賠償，但是日本政權似以此事件發生於其正式治台之前為由，並未妥善處理。麻豆事件不但激起鄰近的府城排外情緒，東部教會亦流傳基督徒與日本人勾結的傳言，而使教會和信徒受到攻擊（巴克禮2022：228）。基督徒不僅遭義軍煽動台人攻擊，日軍攻陷台灣各地後，又誣陷基督徒唆使暴徒反抗日軍，不少基督徒被捕、拘留、虐待、殘殺，禮拜堂被佔用，北部教會有20間禮拜堂被日軍佔用，信徒被殺和失蹤者共計735名（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會 1965：96）。而南部教會如打狗教會也被日軍破壞甚至焚燬，台南教士會因此向日本政府求償（甘為霖2004[1910]：605）。\n\n\n\n**Anti-Christian Movement in China**: In the 1920s, China experienced an anti-Christian movement that can be divided into four periods: protests initiated by the Anti-Christian Student Alliance in Shanghai and the Beijing Anti-Religious Federation in 1922; the period before the May Thirtieth Incident (1924-1925), focusing on reclaiming educational rights; the anti-imperialist movement following the May Thirtieth Incident; and the anti-Christian and xenophobic wave during the Northern Expedition from autumn 1926 to spring 1927 (Luo Weihong, 2014: 387).\n\n\nAlthough the anti-Christian wave in China did not directly affect Taiwanese society, the anti-Christian and xenophobic trend initiated by the Northern Expedition in 1926-1927 impacted many missionaries working in mainland China, causing them to temporarily seek refuge in Japan and Taiwan. Simultaneously, due to the United Church of Canada incident in 1927, many missionaries in northern Taiwan left, and those missionaries temporarily fleeing China were invited to work in Taiwan, filling the gap caused by the United Church of Canada incident. For instance, John F. Fleming and Robert B. McClure of the Canadian United Church's Henan Mission served in northern Taiwan for a year. Fleming taught English in Tamsui, while McClure assisted with Mackay's medical work. However, these missionaries could only serve for a short period, leading the Presbyterian Church in Canada to send more missionaries to Taiwan (Historical Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan General Assembly, 1965: 203).\n\n\nThough the Anti-Christian Movement did not directly affect Taiwan, it led to missionaries fleeing China, with some coming to Taiwan. Alongside the departure of missionaries due to the United Church of Canada incident, these two international events converged in Taiwan, illustrating their indirect impact and the result of globalization.\n\n\n中國的非基運動（Anti-Christian Movement）。中國在1920年代發生可分為四個時期的反基督教運動：1922年非上海基督教學生同盟、北京非宗教大同盟發起的抗議；1924-1925年五卅慘案前，以收回教育權為主線；五卅慘案後的反帝運動；1926年秋至1927年春的北伐期間（羅偉虹2014：387）。雖然中國的反教浪潮並未直接影響台灣社會，帶來連動效果，然而1926-1927年以北伐軍策動的反教和排外風潮，衝擊許多宣教士在中國大陸的工作，因而暫時避難到日本和台灣。同時，1927年由於加拿大聯合教會事件風波，不少台灣北部教會宣教士陸續離開，而前述暫時離開中國避難的宣教士，即獲邀在台工作，正好補足加拿大聯合教會事件導致的宣教士短缺問題。例如加拿大聯合教會河南宣道會傅理明（John F. Fleming）與羅明遠（Robert B. McClure）在北台灣服務一年。前者在淡水教英文，後者協助馬偕的醫療工作。然而，這些宣教士只能短期服務，加拿大長老教會因此又陸續差派宣教士來台（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：203）。非基運動雖未直接影響臺灣，但其導致的宣教士逃離，其中部分來台；加上加拿大聯合教會事件導致宣教士離開，兩件國際事件匯合在臺灣，可見其間接影響，是為全球化之結果。\n\n\n\nThe main event that could be characterized as anti-Christian was the Boxer Uprising, which will be discussed in the subsequent decade. \n\n\nBefore that event there were tremors of lesser size and magnitude that in retrospect displayed elements of the violence that was yet to come. \n\n\nMost anti-Christian sentiment was expressed at the small scale, either small acts of non-violent hostility to the missionaries, or individuated acts of violence against converts within families or communities. Missionary accounts treat the former as a daily occurrence attributed to hatred of foreigners and/or their religion. They included such acts as refusing to sell or rent land to foreigners, harassing foreigners while preaching or while going about more mundane affairs, or spreading rumors about evil intentions/magic. Often those with the most vocal opinions also had a direct conflict of interest, e.g., Confucian students or doctors of Chinese medicine. On a few occasions threats did erupt into violence against missionaries, such as in 1885 when a missionary doctor was surrounded and captured by soldiers who suspected him of murdering children for their eyes and hearts (for use in making medicine). (Boyd 59)\n\n\nIndividuated violence towards converts was frequent. The common pattern was that a Christian individual or family was targeted by neighbors or family members with a demand to recant. Often the hostility was due to a perceived threat to collective security or practice, e.g., refusal to participate in family sacrifices or contribute to the maintenance of a village temple, or else the fear that harboring a Christian in their midst would bring misfortune or divine punishment. In missionary accounts, attention is naturally given to those who refused to apostatize and were tortured, exiled or killed. In their depictions of violence against converts, both Catholic and Protestant accounts clearly mimic the images of early Roman martyrdom.\n\n\nThe following account is typical:\n\n\"a Christian, head of household, and a man of wealth and influence, had apostatized publicly five years ago, to the great sorrow of his parents and all of the Christians. To worsen his scandal, this unhappy man hosted a great meal to which all the surrounding pagans were invited. He exposed, in front of them, the plaques of the ancestors all spread out, along with the images of the false gods and all sort of Chinese superstitions; he commanded the family to honor these plaques and images, and they entreated him adore only the true God from now on. Prayers and supplications were useless and could not bring back the man back to his senses. His son, seven years old, taught secretly by his Christian mother and other relatives, refused to burn incense to the ancestors on New Year's Day, and nearly wore the crown of martyrdom, with his own father as the torturer. In sorrow, the neighbors had to tear the man off of his son, his hands bloodied, saying that he wanted to offer his son in sacrifice.” (Annual bishop report, Guillon, 1892)\n\n\nSpikes in violence were prompted by a few sources. Rumors about the nefarious intentions of foreign medicine (both Catholic and Protestant missions maintained dispensaries) were common in Shenyang and on a few occasions nearly broke into violence. External events such as the Tianjin massacre of 1871 and rumors about an immanent invasion of China by Russia during the 1880s prompted a general air of suspicion and rumors of retaliation in which all of the foreigners would be slaughtered. Such claims (often expressed as a threat directly to the missionaries) rose and fell in conjunction with other rumors about political intrigue.\n\n\nThe first bout of organized violence was the Zaili revolt of 1892. This revolt was a precursor to the Boxers in that it was not a focused and clearly-led rebellion but rather a loosely coordinated snowball of localized violence that turned partly against the missions and Chinese Christians with same sorts of claims of ridding China of the foreigners and their malevolent magic that would later characterize the Boxers. \n\n\nThe letter of Guillon (1892), then VA of Manchuria, describes the Zaili massacre of Christians in Jilin:“an indigenous priest, P. Lin, and hundreds of neophytes had their throats cut with distinction neither of age nor of sex. …  The plot hatched by Tsai-Li-Ti, a sect dominating in Mongolia and Manchuria, had been directed against the Christians in the area of the massacres, but it had burst earlier than its authors would have liked. It was the suddenness of the blow which saved us.” (Annual bishop report, Guillon 1892)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwhelmingly the most important event of the period, or of the decades that preceded or followed, was the Boxer Uprising. This event reached Manchuria, in the summer of 1900 and was put down within a matter of months. That specific event was in a sense carried by settlers    or sojourners from the Boxer heartland in Shandong and Hebei, the source of Manchuria’s largest number of migrants, but more fundamentally, it was just one especially violent iteration of themes that were already present in the Zaili rebellion ten years earlier, and that would continue to pop up in much more muted forms later. \n\n\nEvidence from Manchuria confirms that the event was more complex than the story usually told. Missionary reports (as well as official sources) do not dwell on the mystical elements of Boxer lore and instead present it as fairly standard instance of collective violence that was armed and often involved participation of Qing troops. One recorded instance involved the burning of a coal mine by miners who had been sacked. In another, Boxers and Qing troops attacked a village using repeating rifles, while the village itself (mixed Christian and non) had only shotguns.  In other words, this was not the mysticism-driven event that it perhaps started out as in Shandong. There was however clearly violence against Christians. Guillon was killed inside the church, which was burned and sacked. The French mission lost seven missionaries and numerous native clergy, and an unspecified number of native Christians (who were widely scattered in villages). The numbers are unclear because there was no chance to gather information between 1898 and 1903. However, in those two years the mission’s own count of Catholics is 25000 (for the undivided VA) and 17,161 (17,000 in south and 10,161 in north), respectively. I suspect that the rise in the number of Christians in these figures represents the beginning of the uptick in conversions in the aftermath, rather than an attempt to undercount casualties, which must have been high.\n\n\nThe aftermath of the Boxers saw the rapid decline of the anti-foreign faction at court, and as a ripple effect, through lower levels of officialdom and into ordinary society. Both Protestant and Catholic missions report a conspicuous warming of local attitudes towards the Christian presence, officials and police coming to call on missionaries and the like. (Notably in Hulan, which had been a stronghold of anti-missionary sentiment and site of the murder of three French missionaries) Yet within this generally warmer atmosphere, there were still unfriendly officials, including ones such as (Southern Manchuria 1904, 1906) who according to reports incited violence against local Christians by recruiting demobilized Boxers. These sorts of officially-encouraged attacks were however significantly less frequent than in the previous decade.\n\n\nAlso worth noting the Catholic-Protestant rivalry seems to have calmed down during this decade. At any rate the language (e.g., referring to each other as heretics) used in missionary publications is less inflammatory, and although there is still a sense that the other was derelict in the face of the Boxers, there is no further mention of lawsuits or coercive diplomatic measures taken against the other group. Both Catholic and Protestant now describe relations (especially personal relationships) as cordial, if still separate, but some backbiting did still occur in internal publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo specific movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the constant hostility from the Manchukuo, Guomindang, and Communist regimes, there was no open anti-Christian movement, as such. By the 1940s, even the formerly sanguine Catholics were aware of the impossibility of working with the Manchukuo regime, and neither Catholics nor the returning Protestants had any enthusiasm for the return of the Guomindang. Both saw the Communists as the greater threat because that group (unlike the Guomindang) was ideologically disciplined and (unlike the Manchukuo regime) was able to force its social policies deep into society. \n\n\nThe dismantling of the missions and hostile takeover of the Church by the Communist regime began in the late 1940s, but did not complete until 1951-1952. \n\n \n\n### Section: Bibliography\n\n\nAndré Grabar.

Among these, religion emerged as both a cultural force and a mechanism of governance. Under President Syngman Rhee, whose political vision was deeply rooted in Protestant Christianity, the religious policy of the First Republic reveals a dual structure: the promotion of Christianity as a core national identity and the state's strategic involvement in managing other religious communities. This paper provides an objective analysis of the First Republic's religious policies, particularly focusing on the institutional promotion of Christianity and the state's role in shaping the religious landscape of post-liberation Korea.\n\nThe 1948 Constitution of the Republic of Korea enshrined the principle of religious freedom and the separation of religion and state (Article 20). However, in practice, the Rhee administration implemented a range of policies that strongly favored Christianity, particularly Protestantism, while engaging selectively with other religious traditions. This gap between constitutional ideals and practical governance reveals the complex interplay of ideology, religion, and statecraft in early Korean democracy.\n\nPresident Rhee, educated and baptized in the United States, viewed Christianity as not only a personal faith but also a civilizational foundation for national development. In his 1945 speech at Jeongdong First Methodist Church, he stated his intention to \"build the nation on the Bible.\" This vision materialized in symbolic and institutional forms: Christian rituals were adopted in the 1948 National Assembly opening and presidential inauguration, and Protestant leaders like Rev. Lee Yoon-young played ceremonial roles in state functions.\n\nInstitutionally, Christianity was embedded into various sectors:\n\nThe military chaplain system and prison ministry (hyeongmok system) were implemented, primarily under Protestant and Catholic leadership.\n\nChristian media institutions such as CBS (1954) and Far East Broadcasting Company (1956) were established with state approval.\n\nNumerous high-level government officials were practicing Christians, creating a visible religious preference in governance.\n\nChristian lawmakers were significantly represented in the Constituent Assembly (estimated 21–24% of members), disproportionately high compared to the national Christian population at the time (0.5–2%).\n\n\nChristianity became aligned with the state’s ideological opposition to communism, especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The persecution of Christians in North Korea, including the martyrdom of figures such as Rev. Son Yang-won, was highlighted to construct Christianity as a bulwark of anti-communism and moral resistance. Churches and Christian institutions supported state campaigns in education, military morale, and national reconstruction.\n\nChristian groups also supported land reform policies. Rhee's 1949–50 land reform, which dismantled the landlord-tenant structure of colonial Korea and transitioned tenant farmers into landowners, was positively evaluated from a Christian worldview emphasizing economic justice and love-based governance. The land reform reduced inequality and contributed to the foundation of economic modernization.\n\n\nWhile Christianity received state endorsement, other religions experienced selective engagement, state-led reform, and in some cases, coercive control. In 1954, amid conflict between celibate (bigu) monks and married clergy (daecheo seung), the Rhee administration issued the \"Purification Edict,\" recognizing the former as legitimate. While the edict facilitated institutional reform and monastic consolidation, it also constituted an unconstitutional state intervention, as condemned by the National Assembly.The state's involvement set a precedent for political entanglement in Buddhist affairs that reverberated into the late 20th century.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1964, the Confucian community was divided between the 'Nong-eun' and 'Orthodox' factions. Although a Christian, Rhee was endorsed as president of the Confucian Yudohoe by the Nong-eun group. His acceptance contributed to the marginalization of traditional leaders like Kim Chang-sook and raised concerns about religious neutrality in governance.\n\nEmergent religious movements were often labeled as \"pseudo-religions\" or \"heresies\" and subjected to police surveillance or outright suppression. In several cases, leaders of new religious groups were arrested, and their organizations forcibly disbanded, in contravention of constitutional protections.\n\nA notable area of church-state conflict was the dispute over mandatory flag salutes (kukgi baerye), particularly in Presbyterian circles. Rooted in a historical resistance to Shinto shrine worship under Japanese rule, some Christians interpreted the bowing to the national flag as a form of idolatry. Prominent Christian leaders, such as Rev. Sohn Yang-won and Pastor Lee Won-young, publicly opposed the practice, leading to legal and social confrontations between churches and schools enforcing patriotic rituals.\n\nThe First Republic's religious policies enabled the rapid institutional growth of Christianity and its integration into state ideology. Simultaneously, these policies disrupted the autonomy of other religious traditions and weakened their internal governance. While Christianity benefited from state support, it also became entangled with political power, leading to long-term challenges in maintaining religious neutrality and public trust.\n\nThe religious policy of the First Republic was a complex system shaped by the theological convictions of its leadership, the exigencies of Cold War politics, and the sociopolitical restructuring of post-colonial Korea. Christianity was not merely favored but structurally embedded in the state's vision of modernization and anti-communism. Conversely, the state's interventions in Buddhism, Confucianism, and new religions illustrate how religious diversity was managed through selective support and strategic control. These dynamics have left a lasting imprint on the relationship between religion and state in South Korea.\n\n\nTable 1.

Christian leaders like Cho Man-sik were viewed as advocates of democratic order. In October 1945, Kim Il Sung reportedly instructed Kang Ryang-uk, “Bring progressive and influential pastors and elders into the fold, so that Christians will gain correct awareness of our righteous cause for building a new democratic Korea.” As a result, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) was founded in Pyongyang on November 28, 1946, with Kang Ryang-uk as chairman. The KCF's platform declared its goal to “awaken patriotism based on Christian principles of love and to participate in the national construction project.” However, internally, the KCF was a tool for weakening and absorbing the independent church. According to Kim Yang-sun, a pastor who defected to the South, the KCF's real purpose was to “foment internal division and drive the church to self-destruction.”\n\n\nRegime Establishment and War Period (1948–1953): Systematic Persecution and Emergence of the Underground Church\n\nAfter the establishment of the DPRK in 1948, Christianity was redefined as a “remnant of imperialist ideology” and associated with American espionage. During the Korean War, Christians were accused of collaborating with UN forces, leading to mass arrests, executions, and forced disappearances. Pastor Yoo Sahyun, who defected to the South in 1952, recalled that “five or six believers gathered in secret, shedding tears in prayer,” indicating the shift of religious life into secrecy. Following the war, the equation “Christian = spy” became entrenched, and even home-based religious activity was criminalized and surveilled. Incidents such as the hymnal case in Pakcheon County (1959) and the cross incident at Wonsan Railway Factory (1960) show that some believers still tried to worship in secret.\n\n\nPostwar Era (1953–1960): Atheism Campaigns and Dismantling of Public Religion\n\nAfter the war, the North Korean regime initiated a comprehensive atheism campaign. The book Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959) by Chong Ha-chol defined Christianity as “a belief in divine power that undermines socialist construction by replacing self-effort with the will of God.” The 1957 Iman-hwa case in Yongcheon County—where a pastor was prosecuted for refusing to vote—illustrates how Christian dissent was framed as anti-socialist behavior. As a result, “all official Christian activity in North Korea ceased between 1958 and 1972.” During this period, Christianity survived only as a clandestine faith practiced in underground networks, many of which were infiltrated or dissolved.\n\n\nTable 2.

Religious institutions, especially Protestant churches, supported the regime and became entwined with state-led anti-communist campaigns.\n\nIn the North, the state pursued the \"Democratic Base Theory”a strategy to export socialist revolution from the North to the South. Christianity was violently suppressed as a pro-American and counter-revolutionary force. Thousands of pastors and believers fled to the South or were imprisoned. The Korean Christian Federation (Josŏn Kidokkyo-do Yŏnmaeng) was established in 1946 to serve as a nominal religious body under state control.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Korean state’s relationship with religion underwent a fundamental transformation, shaped first by the short-lived Second Republic and then restructured by Park Chung-hee’s military regime. This period witnessed a decisive reordering of the religious landscape, in which the state not only repositioned the power balance among major religious traditions—Protestantism, Buddhism, and Catholicism—but also institutionalized and politicized religion as a tool of social control, ideological reproduction, and regime legitimacy.\n\nFollowing the April 1960 Revolution, the Second Republic, led by Prime Minister Chang Myon and President Yun Bo-seon, pledged to depart from the overt Protestant favoritism of the Syngman Rhee era. One of its first symbolic moves was to curtail the so-called Hyungmok System—a religious education framework that disproportionately favored Christian teachings in public schools. Chang, a devout Catholic, supported the removal of religious bias from state institutions and attempted to position the state as a neutral arbiter in religious affairs.\n\nHowever, the administration’s capacity to intervene constructively in religious disputes was severely limited. Nowhere was this more evident than in the Six Bhikkhus’ Seppuku Incident, which occurred in November 1960 at Gaeunsa Temple in Gwangju. In a dramatic protest against the dominance of married Buddhist clergy (taech’o), six celibate monks performed ritual disembowelment to draw national attention to the moral and doctrinal decay they perceived in postcolonial Korean Buddhism. The Second Republic, claiming neutrality, refrained from intervening. Yet this non-intervention effectively abdicated responsibility for mediating sectarian conflict and allowed the roots of systemic religious crisis to deepen. This failure to regulate religion during the Second Republic laid the groundwork for the Park Chung-hee regime’s more aggressive religious policy. After the 1961 military coup, Park moved quickly to consolidate state power, and religion became both a target and a tool in that consolidation process. In 1962, his government enacted the Buddhist Property Management Act, which required Buddhist temples to register as juridical entities and subjected their financial activities to government oversight. This law signaled the state’s attempt to tame Buddhist institutions by embedding them in bureaucratic structures, effectively subordinating them to the goals of developmental nationalism.\n\nFrom 1965 onward, Park’s regime began actively cultivating a close relationship with the Protestant community, particularly its evangelical and anti-communist branches. That year, the inaugural Presidential Prayer Breakfast was held—an event that would become an annual ritual of religious legitimation. By 1969, Park himself began attending the breakfasts, projecting the image of a morally upright, God-fearing leader who governed not only by law but by providence. This partnership was not merely symbolic. During the Vietnam War, the government’s troop deployment policy was enthusiastically supported by Protestant churches. Across the country, “National Salvation Prayer Meetings” were organized to bless soldiers, condemn communism, and equate patriotism with Christian faith. A particularly large prayer rally held in 1971 in Yeouido drew over 300,000 people and was interpreted by many as a fusion of evangelical fervor and patriotic duty. The zenith of this alliance came in 1973 with Billy Graham’s crusade in Seoul, where more than one million people gathered in Yeouido Plaza. Organized with the logistical support of the government, the event not only symbolized Protestantism’s ascendance but also projected an image of South Korea as a Christian, anti-communist beacon in Asia. As historian Keun-Young Lee notes, “The crusade served as a carefully staged convergence of global evangelicalism, authoritarian nationalism, and Cold War ideology.”\n\nWhile Protestantism flourished, the state continued to institutionalize other religious traditions as well, albeit on different terms. In 1968, the military chaplain system was officially codified, restricting participation to the three “recognized” religions: Protestantism, Buddhism, and Catholicism. In 1969, Buddhism gained further ground when the Buddhist Military Chaplain Corps was formally established. In 1975, the Park government designated Buddha’s Birthday as a national holiday, completing a cycle of public recognition that had begun with bureaucratic control.\n\nYet the autonomy of Buddhism remained compromised. In 1977, pro-government Buddhist lawmakers formed the Jeonggakhoe, an organization that coordinated Buddhist support for state policy. By 1979, Buddhist leaders were conducting ceremonial prayer rites for the president himself—demonstrating how thoroughly the tradition had been co-opted into the regime’s symbolic order.\n\nMeanwhile, Protestantism experienced explosive demographic growth. Census data shows that the Protestant population grew from approximately 1.5 million in 1960 to over 7 million by 1973, and 9.6 million by 1985. This expansion was fueled not only by spiritual fervor but also by the structural privileges Protestants enjoyed: dominance in military chaplaincies, favored access to public education and broadcasting, and proximity to elite political and economic circles.\n\nThe ideological synergy between Park’s developmental nationalism and Protestant revivalism was particularly evident in the parallel messaging of the Saemaul (New Village) Movement and the early morning prayer movement. Both promoted self-discipline, moral reform, and nation-building through faith—faith in God, and in the nation. As theologian Park Myung-soo observes, “The Saemaul Movement was the national version of early morning prayer, and early morning prayer was the devotional version of Saemaul.” This symbiosis between church and state was not without risk. While it brought institutional benefits and cultural prominence to the Protestant community, it also blurred the lines between prophetic witness and political complicity. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, the alignment between Park Chung-hee’s authoritarian regime and Protestant Christianity laid the foundation for one of the most consequential and controversial alliances in Korea’s modern religious history.\n\n\nTable 1. Timeline of Religious Policies in Korea’s Second and Third Republics (1960-1972)\n\n| Year | Government | Religious Policy or Event |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nov 1960 | Second Republic | Six Bhikkhus’ Seppuku Incident – Violent protest against clerical corruption in Buddhism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| May 1961 | Transitional Military Regime (pre-Third Republic) | Park Chung-hee seizes power via May 16 coup |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| May 1962 | Park Chung-hee Regime | Buddhist Property Management Act enacted – state regulation over Buddhist finances |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Feb 1965 | Park Chung-hee Regime | Presidential Prayer Breakfast begins – symbol of Protestant-state alliance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mar 1966 | Park Chung-hee Regime | 1st Official Presidential Prayer Breakfast held at Chosun Hotel |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1968 | Park Chung-hee Regime | Military chaplain system formalized – Protestantism, Buddhism, Catholicism recognized |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969 | Park Chung-hee Regime | Buddhist chaplain system launched |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| May 1969 | Park Chung-hee Regime | 2nd Presidential Prayer Breakfast – with direct participation of the president |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mar 1972 | Park Chung-hee Regime | Reserve Forces Chaplain System established |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Oct 1972 | Park Chung-hee Regime | Yushin Constitution proclaimed, ushering in an era of authoritarian rule |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1975 | Park Chung-hee Regime | Buddha’s Birthday designated as a national holiday |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n    \n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nThe 1960s marked a critical phase in North Korea’s religious policy, characterized by the culmination of direct persecution and a subtle shift toward utilizing religious institutions as symbolic tools for state propaganda. During this period, the regime no longer needed to suppress a visible, organized church—because it had effectively dismantled one. Instead, it focused on eliminating remnants of underground religious life, intensifying atheism campaigns, and rebranding religion as a tool for external diplomacy.\n\n\nStrengthened Atheism and the Institutional Disappearance of Christianity\n\nNorth Korea’s official stance in the early 1960s remained consistent with Marxist–Leninist atheism. One of the regime’s key ideological texts, Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959) by Chong Ha-chol, declared:\n\n“We must heighten revolutionary vigilance to prevent the further infiltration of religious influence. We must promptly identify, expose, and punish the anti-revolutionary activities of reactionary religious elements still lurking in the northern half of the Republic.”\n\nThe regime institutionalized this atheism through cultural production and propaganda. The 1966 film Choi Hak-shin’s Family portrayed Christianity as an instrument of American imperialism and national betrayal, reinforcing the idea that religious faith was a threat to socialist progress. These messages were disseminated throughout schools, workplaces, and local political meetings, solidifying the image of religion as anti-socialist. By this time, all official Christian activity had ceased—a fact recorded by defectors and confirmed in scholarly research. From 1958 until at least the early 1970s, public worship, pastoral ministry, and church functions no longer existed in any legal form.\n\n\nSuppression of Underground Religious Practices: Key Cases\n\nDespite the suppression of official religion, small pockets of underground believers continued to practice their faith, often secretly. These groups were met with harsh punishment.\n\n1957: In Yongcheon County, Pastor Lee Man-hwa refused to participate in national elections and was punished for anti-socialist behavior.\n\n1959: A teacher in Pakcheon County was caught teaching hymns to children at her home and was dismissed.\n\n1960: A wooden cross was discovered at the Wonsan Railway Factory, prompting an investigation into hidden religious activities.\n\nSuch cases underscore that even minimal, private expressions of Christian belief were criminalized and subjected to state discipline.\n\n\nMaintenance of Religious Organizations for Political Utility\n\nBy the mid-1960s, North Korea began to transition from outright elimination to symbolic preservation of religious organizations. Groups such as the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and the Korean Buddhist Federation were retained in name only. These organizations had no grassroots membership or independent function but were instead “state-dominated structures preserved solely for external mobilization.” This shift coincided with North Korea’s evolving strategy of South–North diplomacy and inter-Korean peace overtures. Religious organizations were reactivated not for worship, but for participation in political dialogues and international events—such as inter-Korean religious meetings and peace forums. Their existence served the regime’s image of “religious freedom” to foreign observers.\n\nThe religious policy of the 1960s did not merely repress belief—it functionally dissolved religion as an active social force. Christians were reclassified in official documents as part of the “hostile or wavering class,” meaning they faced ongoing disadvantages in education, employment, and residency rights.\n\nIn short, religion survived neither as faith nor as institution, but as an empty structure appropriated by the state. What remained was a system in which faith could exist only as silence, and religious organizations functioned as ideological instruments.\n\n\nTable 2.  Timeline: Key Events and Policy Shifts\n\n\n| Year | Event / Policy | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1959 | Publication of \"Why Do We Oppose Religion?\" | Chong Ha-chol’s ideological treatise laid the foundation for atheism campaigns by framing religion as anti-revolutionary. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1959 | Hymnal Instruction Incident in Pakcheon County | An elementary school teacher was caught teaching hymns to students at home and was penalized. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960 | Wonsan Railway Factory Cross Incident | A wooden cross was found at the factory, prompting investigations into underground Christian activities. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1962–1964 | Cessation of Religious Organizational Activity | Groups like the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) ceased public functions and became symbolic entities only. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1966 | Release of the Anti-Christian Film \"Choi Hak-shin’s Family\" | A propaganda film portraying Christianity as a tool of American imperialism and a betrayal of the nation. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1968–1969 | Revival of Religious Organizations for External Use | Religious groups were reactivated for inter-Korean dialogue and international appearances in support of North Korean diplomacy. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nInter-Korean Unification Policies and Religious Roles: Political Silence and Religious Inertia\n\nFollowing the April Revolution, the Chang Myon government promoted UN-supervised elections as a unification method. However, after the 1961 coup, the Park Chung-hee regime emphasized economic development over reunification, asserting that material strength was a prerequisite for unification. Protestant churches largely complied with this framework and showed little initiative regarding national reconciliation.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea began conceptualizing a federal unification system, where both Koreas would maintain their own systems under a joint body. Despite this theoretical shift, religion remained tightly controlled and most churches were forced underground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious Policy in 1970s South Korea: Uncontrolled Control, Unfree Freedom\n\nUnder the authoritarian Yushin regime, South Korea’s religious policy in the 1970s outwardly upheld the principle of church-state separation, but in practice, religion was subordinated to the needs of political legitimization and regime maintenance. Rather than through explicit legal codes, control was exercised indirectly—through administrative guidelines, state-facilitated rituals, military chaplaincy systems, and selective policy incentives. The Protestant churches, especially conservative denominations, became key partners of the regime. The Presidential Prayer Breakfast, modeled after the American version, became a symbolic bridge connecting Christianity with the state. “Before the Yushin constitutional reform, Park Chung Hee made four agreements with Kim Joon-gon. One was that the government would fully support the total Christianization of the military, led by pro-government churches and missions”.\n\nTable 1. Comparison: Explicit vs. Implicit Religious Control\n\n| Category | Explicit Control (Colonial Era) | Implicit Control (1970s) | Main Target | Policy Goal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Policy Means | Temple Ordinance (1911), Propagation Rules (1920) | Prayer breakfasts, military chaplaincy, religious councils | Buddhism and all religions | Social order, imperial integration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Key Features | Direct legal regulations without constitutional limits | Administrative and political influence within legal boundaries | Mainstream Protestantism favored | Legitimizing regime, social control |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nRather than direct legal regulation, religious policy operated through administrative guidelines, educational policies, political rituals, military chaplaincy, and selective support of religious events. In 1973, the government even attempted to revise the Social Organization Registration Act, prompting the establishment of a “Religious Affairs Council.” According to contemporary accounts, “Religious groups unanimously opposed this bill on the grounds that it violated religious freedom, and Catholics, Buddhists, and Confucians alike voiced strong resistance”.\n\n\nTable 2. Key Instruments of Religious Policy\n\n| Type | Example | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Administrative Guidelines | Religious site registration, budget reporting, school licensing | Managing institutional religious influence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Ceremonies | Presidential prayer breakfasts, National Assembly religious events | Political legitimization through religion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Educational Policy | High school equalization policy, loss of school autonomy | Limiting religious influence through education |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget and State Support | Buddha’s Birthday public holiday, military chaplaincy | Balancing religious representation, reducing grievances |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Legal Framework | Private School Act, Basic Education Law | Balancing autonomy and public accountability |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nReligious Responses and Impact\n\n\nProtestantism\n\nProtestant churches experienced dramatic expansion, backed by state support, media coverage, and alignment with anti-communist ideology. Large-scale mass baptisms, such as 26 combined ceremonies reaching over 120,000 soldiers, symbolized the success of the church-state alliance. But this alliance came at a cost: the adoption of material growth, size, and success as the ultimate religious values. This so-called “theology of growth” imported from American church marketing principles was infused with capitalist logic. “Churches became obsessed with growth and efficiency, mimicking the mobilization model of Park Chung Hee’s developmental dictatorship”. This was further legitimized through “Threefold Salvation” (salvation of spirit, health, and finances), as preached by Cho Yong-gi, turning the church into “a provider of material blessing and economic upward mobility”. Rather than transcending the material, Korean Protestantism in the 1970s internalized materialism and nationalism, transforming itself into a “religion of materialism.” “Having replaced transcendence with measurable growth, Korean Protestantism effectively became ‘Church-ism’ rather than Christianity”.\n\nConservative leaders idolized church growth as both a spiritual and national solution. Han Kyung-jik declared that “when most of the people convert to Christianity through evangelism, political, economic, and cultural transformation will follow”. But this church-centric ideology functioned as a religious mirror of state authoritarianism, promoting internal hierarchies and suppressing dissent. Strict tithing, Sunday laws, patriarchal clergy structures, and doctrinal exclusivism characterized this era. Church was no longer a community of faith but “an institution of power” modeled after both capitalist competition and Confucian hierarchy.\n\n\nBuddhism\n\nBuddhism faced institutional disadvantages regarding public holidays, access to the military chaplaincy, and internal autonomy. Buddha’s Birthday was only designated as a national holiday in 1975. “On April 23, 1974, 11 Buddhist sects submitted a formal petition to the President and Cabinet members, requesting that Buddha’s Birthday be declared a public holiday”. Yet internal divisions and power struggles within the Jogye Order provided an opening for government interference, culminating in the October 27 Incident of 1980, when the state raided major temples under the pretext of reform. “While reform may have been necessary, such efforts should have originated from within Buddhism itself; instead, state intervention led to renewed divisions and chaos”.\n\nCatholicism\n\nInitially neutral, the Catholic Church took a more confrontational stance in the mid-1970s, particularly after the formation of the Justice and Peace Priests' Association in 1974. Catholic clergy began participating in democratization and human rights campaigns. “By the late 1970s, the Catholic Church had developed a theology of social engagement and emerged at the forefront of anti-Yushin activism”.\n\nWon Buddhism and Other Minority Religions\n\nIn 1975, Won Buddhism submitted a request to participate in the military chaplaincy program, but it was denied. Only in 2007 was formal participation granted. The Unification Church, meanwhile, received informal protection and support from the regime and was strategically utilized for diplomatic and propaganda purposes. “Korea’s religious policy was fundamentally a dual system—favoring pro-government religions with privileges while marginalizing those that criticized the regime”.\n\n\nTable 3. Summary of Religious Policy Changes\n\n| Period | Policy Characteristics | Key Policies/Events | Impact |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese Colonial Rule | Coercive, colonial control | Temple Ordinance, Propagation Rules | Loss of autonomy, attempt to nationalize religion |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1945–1960 | Separation of church and state, religious freedom | Abolition of colonial religious structures | Increased possibility of religious pluralism |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960–1970 | Beginning of policy-based control | Middle school equalization, reduced autonomy of religious schools | Weakened political role of religions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970–1980 | Intensified implicit control and political use | Prayer breakfasts, military chaplaincy, religious councils, Buddha’s Birthday as public holiday | Protestant-regime alliance; Buddhist/Catholic gradual resistance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThe Intensification of the Supreme Leader System and the Transformation of Religious Policy in North Korea\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a pivotal moment in North Korean political and religious history, characterized by the formal institutionalization of the Suryŏng (Supreme Leader) system and a gradual shift in the regime's religious policies. While the external structure of religious persecution remained largely intact, nuanced changes in the official treatment of religion—particularly Christianity—began to emerge as the state sought ideological legitimacy and international engagement.\n\nThe proclamation of the 1972 Socialist Constitution formalized the centralization of power under Kim Il-sung and codified the Juche ideology as the core political doctrine of the state. This consolidation of power was further reinforced by the establishment of the presidency, making Kim Il-sung the supreme source of law and ideology. Within this emerging hegemonic system, religion was redefined not only as an ideological threat but also as a potentially manageable tool for national unity and international diplomacy. As Seong Lim Noh argues, “religious policies are therefore considered as a form of implicit cultural policy—a political strategy to stabilize the regime through cultural management”​.\n\nThis new phase in religious governance was neither a full liberalization nor a mere continuation of anti-religious campaigns. Rather, it represented a strategic recalibration. As Jae-Chun Won outlines, prior to 1972, North Korea had implemented a four-phase model of religious suppression, culminating in the “Era of Juche” from 1972 onward, during which persecution became more systematic and ideological rather than overtly violent​. While the anti-religious rhetoric persisted—Christianity continued to be depicted as an ideological weapon of imperialism—the state simultaneously pursued a controlled revival of religious institutions to serve the regime’s foreign policy objectives.\n\nThe revival of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1972 exemplifies this dual strategy. Jooseop Keum emphasizes that this revival was not a return to ecclesiastical autonomy but rather a means of creating a “state-church” model that operated within the boundaries of Juche-based socialism​. Religious institutions such as the KCF were allowed to function as long as they aligned with state goals, especially those pertaining to reunification rhetoric and international recognition.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the 1972 Constitution (Article 54) introduced language protecting “freedom to believe or not believe in religion.” However, as Philo Kim points out, this was not a genuine concession of rights but rather a strategic ambiguity designed to present a façade of tolerance to the international community while maintaining strict control over religious expression​.\n\nThe changes were particularly evident in the regime’s portrayal of Christianity in cultural productions. Anti-Christian films such as The Sky Beyond the Frontline (1974) and The Spirit Shrine (1978) shifted the focus from atheistic denunciation to more nuanced portrayals of religion as a relic of feudalism and superstition​. This reflected an ideological shift from overt eradication to cultural containment, as the state no longer sought to simply destroy religion but to absorb and neutralize it through Juche-aligned reinterpretation.\n\nIn Gramscian terms, the DPRK’s strategy can be seen as an attempt to integrate civil society (religion) into the hegemonic bloc of the state. As Noh argues, this integration was not merely symbolic but involved a concrete reconfiguration of national ideology to include a form of \"domesticated Protestantism\" that could serve the regime’s diplomatic and unification agendas.\n\nThe transformation in religious policy was thus inseparable from the broader shift toward the Suryŏng system and the codification of Juche as state orthodoxy. It demonstrated the regime’s sophisticated use of religion not only as an internal control mechanism but also as a soft power tool for international legitimation.\n\n\nInter-Korean Unification Policies and Religious Roles: Official Dialogue Begins and Symbolic Shifts\n\nIn 1972, both governments signed the July 4 Joint Statement, affirming the principles of autonomy, peace, and national unity. Although largely symbolic, this was the first formal recognition of each other’s existence. In practice, South Korea intensified internal repression under the Yushin system, while still publicly endorsing peaceful reunification.\n\nChurches in the South remained divided. While some progressive voices began advocating for inter-Korean dialogue, many conservative churches still rejected North Korean churches as illegitimate. In the North, Kim Il-sung's proposal for a Democratic Federal Republic of Koryŏ in 1980 signaled a more pragmatic shift toward coexistence. Religious institutions like the Korean Christian Federation began engaging in international religious diplomacy.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\n\nSouth Korea’s religious policy during the 1980s appeared, at least on the surface, to respect the constitutional right to “freedom of religion.” In reality, however, it reflected a deeply embedded political intent: to utilize and control religion as an instrument of state power. After seizing power through a military coup, the Chun Doo-hwan regime, lacking political legitimacy, pursued a dual strategy of mass mobilization and ideological justification through religious institutions. Religious groups that cooperated with the state were rewarded, while those that were critical of the regime were subjected to pressure or outright suppression. As a result, religious communities were pushed beyond the private realm of faith, becoming social actors forced to choose between alignment with authoritarian power and support for democratization.\n\nThe Gap Between Constitutional Guarantees and Practical Control\n\nArticle 20 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea clearly declares, “All citizens shall enjoy the freedom of religion.” Yet under the 1980s military dictatorship, this constitutional clause was applied selectively, adjusted according to political expediency. In practice, “national security discourse, anti-communist ideology, and the rhetoric of social order” dominated religious policy, and a religious group’s political orientation effectively determined the degree of freedom and activity it was allowed to exercise.\n\nThe regime implemented a three-pronged approach to control and co-opt religious groups. First, it justified institutional intervention into religious organizations’ property, education, and operations through laws such as the Traditional Temples Preservation Act (enacted in 1987), the Hyanggyo Property Act, and the Framework Act on Education. Second, it strengthened administrative oversight of religious groups through registration, heritage designations, and surveillance of religious practices in schools. Third, it applied discriminatory treatment based on political loyalty, transforming the idea of religious freedom into a system of rewards for “compliant religiosity”.\n\n\nThe Symbol of Buddhist Suppression: The 10.27 Incident\n\nThis institutionalized control culminated in the notorious “10.27 Incident”, which occurred on October 27, 1980. Under the codename “Operation Plan 45,” the regime deployed military and police forces to 153 Buddhist temples nationwide in a coordinated sweep. Over 200 monks from the Jogye Order were arrested, and more than 5,000 lay followers were detained, in what was one of the largest state-directed religious crackdowns in modern Korean history.\n\nVen. Na Seung-il, then Secretary-General of the Jogye Order at Gaewoon Temple in Seoul, was abducted by plainclothes officers shortly after morning prayers, and at numerous temples monks were subjected to physical violence, verbal abuse, forced abductions, and unlawful detention. Several monks were taken to Jongmyosa Temple in Namyangju and coerced into participating in what was referred to as “Buddhism’s version of re-education”—a state-run ideological conversion program that included psychological and physical abuse.\n\nThe event was a blatant act of political violence intended to force ideological submission on the Buddhist community. As a result, the Buddhist population, which was estimated at 7.5 million before the incident, fell to around 5.4 million afterward, marking a profound weakening of its organizational strength and public base.\n\nAfter his resignation, Chun Doo-hwan took residence at Baekdamsa Temple, symbolically presenting himself as having entered the Buddhist fold. However, many in the religious community interpreted this move as a hollow ritual aimed at securing political absolution, and the Buddhist world itself became deeply divided over whether or not the temple should have accepted him.\n\n\nLegal and Administrative Mechanisms for Structural Intervention\n\nAccording to Religious Legislation and Policy in Korea and Mongolia, the core of religious policy in the 1980s was to manage and steer religion through a legal-administrative framework. Three major laws formed the foundation of this structure:\n\nThe Traditional Temples Preservation Act enacted on November 28, 1987, and enforced from May 29, 1988 (Act No. 3974), allowed the state to designate Buddhist temples as cultural heritage sites and provide funding for maintenance. However, in practice, the law legitimized state intervention in temple operations. Through this law, the Cultural Heritage Administration and local governments could monitor temple operations and allocate budgets selectively, effectively using financial leverage to influence religious voices.\n\nThe Hyanggyo Property Law, originally intended to protect Confucian community property, gave the state regulatory authority over the use and allocation of traditional assets, allowing room for political interference in the restoration and operation of regional Hyanggyo schools.\n\nThe Framework Act on Education was revised in 1982 to include Article 6(2), which stipulates that “no religious education shall be permitted in schools established by the state or local governments.” While seemingly neutral, this clause gave the state practical oversight over religious activities in public education and served as a legal basis for intervening in the establishment and operation of religiously affiliated schools under the pretext of neutrality.\n\n\nPolitically Selective Budget Allocation\n\nReligious policy in the 1980s did not stop at legal measures; it was further enforced through strategic allocation of state resources. The government administered direct and indirect financial support to religious institutions through ministries such as the Cultural Heritage Administration, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nPreferential Support for Friendly Religious Orders:\n\nReligious institutions that maintained close ties with the Chun Doo-hwan regime—such as certain Protestant denominations and Buddhist leaders—received state subsidies for private school foundations, overseas mission work, and temple maintenance. For example, evangelical Protestant churches that prioritized overseas missions received cultural exchange funds via the Overseas Cultural Promotion Agency or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Their seminaries also received rapid accreditation from the Ministry of Education, whereas schools affiliated with critical denominations experienced delays and audit pressure.\n\nAdministrative Sanctions for Critical Orders:Religious groups critical of the regime were subjected to various forms of administrative reprisal, including:\n\nTax Audits: Catholic institutions affiliated with the Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) were targeted by the National Tax Service for audits. These were not primarily aimed at legal enforcement but served as psychological pressure and a tool to provoke internal conflict.\n\nCultural Heritage Designation Suspensions: Cultural heritage status or restoration funding for temples and churches was retracted or suspended as a way to tacitly punish political dissent.\n\nDelays in School Accreditation: Protestant theological seminaries and schools affiliated with NCCK-member denominations, known for their criticism of the regime, reportedly faced delays or rejection in legal recognition and teacher qualification approvals.\n\nThese examples show that religious activities, though constitutionally protected, were de facto treated as conditional liberties, contingent on the extent to which religious bodies aligned themselves with the regime. Thus, during the 1980s, religious freedom existed in form but operated in reality as a system of rewarded obedience, employed as a tool of practical governance.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThe 1980s marked a pivotal turning point in North Korea’s religious policy. During this period, the regime redefined Christianity not simply as a target for elimination but as a phenomenon that could be controlled and strategically utilized for political and diplomatic purposes. The core of this policy involved restructuring the visible framework of institutional religion under strict state control, while creating the illusion for the international community that “religion was alive” in North Korea. In other words, religion was no longer merely suppressed—it was functionalized within limits that served national interests.\n\nThe 1972 Socialist Constitution codified the contradictory provision that “citizens shall have both freedom of religion and freedom of anti-religious propaganda,” laying the legal foundation for the regime’s dual religious policy. By the 1980s, this policy had evolved into concrete measures. The goal shifted from suppression to strategically using religion as a marker of ideological conformity. Following Kim Jong Il’s official designation as successor in 1974, the regime faced the task of reinforcing its historical legitimacy and moral authority. In this context, religion was made to function in two contradictory ways: while remaining a potential threat, it also served as a vehicle to legitimize the hereditary regime within tightly staged boundaries. At times, state propaganda emphasized that Kim Il Sung “understood the spirit of Christianity,” highlighting his family’s Presbyterian background to construct a dual image.\n\nBehind these policies lay a parallel structure between Juche ideology and religious expression. The “Ten Principles for the Establishment of the Monolithic Ideological System” declared that “Kim Il Sung’s instructions must be accepted as doctrine and his authority must be made absolute,” thus mimicking the logic of religious dogma. Kim Jong Il’s 1982 treatise On the Juche Idea defined Juche as a human-centered philosophy proclaiming that “man is the master of everything and decides everything,” thereby institutionalizing a system in which the supreme leader assumed quasi-religious authority.\n\nIn practice, the official religious institutions became tools of social order and internal control. Churches no longer served as free spaces of worship but instead functioned as mechanisms for sorting and isolating ideologically conforming believers. “Recognized churches were not just places of worship—they were instruments for organizing and containing believers deemed trustworthy by the regime.” Pastors ceased to be theological guides and instead served as ethical educators who interpreted Party morality and taught obedience.\n\nThe most visible example of this transformation was the construction of Bongsu Church in 1988, which was built in preparation for the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students in Pyongyang. Designed as a religious façade for foreign visitors, “the church was constructed for international political consideration and functioned more as a propaganda stage than a house of worship.”\n\nThe structure of North Korean Christianity increasingly took the form of a divided communication system—between external and internal messaging. While externally showcasing religious freedom, the internal reality was marked by tight surveillance and ideological control. Go Young-eun analyzed this as a “closed but outward-oriented communication structure,” in which religion no longer functioned as an expression of faith but as a symbolic language for maintaining the regime.\n\n\nInter-Korean Unification Policies and Religion\n\n\nThe 1980s marked a period of significant transition in unification policies in both South and North Korea. During this time, religious institutions—especially those within Christianity—responded actively and sought to shape unification discourse. Both governments’ unification strategies were closely linked to regime survival, and religious organizations in the South and North became deeply involved, either forming their own positions or exerting influence on public debates and international perceptions.\n\n\nSouth Korea’s Unification Policy and Religious Involvement\n\nThe Chun Doo-hwan regime, being a military dictatorship with weak political legitimacy, bolstered anti-communist ideology while nominally proposing a \"National Harmony and Democratic Unification Plan\". However, in substance, this policy was closer to an absorption-type unification strategy, which excluded realistic cooperation from the North and assumed one-sided integration. As democratization movements intensified in South Korea during the 1980s, unification discourse became increasingly vibrant within civil society, and religious circles took a leading role. A prominent example is as follows: The National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) released its historic “Declaration on the National Reunification and Peace of the Korean Church” in 1988. This statement adopted the three principles of the July 4 Joint Statement—autonomy, peace, and national unity—but emphasized humanitarianism and democratic participation as essential values. The declaration was a bold attempt to provide a moral and ethical alternative to state-centered unification narratives. Moreover, the NCCK collaborated with international partners such as the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the United Church of Canada, establishing inter-Korean ecumenical dialogue channels. These partnerships sought to legitimize unification discussions morally on the global stage through international ecumenism.\n\n\nNorth Korea’s Unification Policy and Religious Response\n\nAt the 6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in 1980, North Korea formalized its proposal for the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryŏ. Based on a \"one nation, one state, two systems, two governments\" model, this plan rejected both absorption and war-based unification in favor of gradual coexistence and phased integration. Although preconditions like the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the South were unacceptable to Seoul, this vision nonetheless reflected mutual influence between the North and South amid rising democratic aspirations and unofficial exchanges. The 1988 visits by Rev. Moon Ik-hwan and student activist Im Su-kyung to Pyongyang were watershed moments. These events led North Korean authorities to recognize the potential of religion as a diplomatic tool. Thereafter, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) began to actively engage with overseas churches and progressive South Korean denominations. This international outreach eventually expanded into the humanitarian aid exchanges of the 1990s, with religion functioning as a strategic channel for regime survival and soft diplomacy.\n\n\nThe Three Missiological Strategies of South Korean Churches\n\nDuring this period, South Korean churches broadly followed one of three strategic lines in their approach to North Korea:\n\nCrusader-style \"Northern Advance\" Missions: Conservative churches viewed North Korea as the \"kingdom of evil\" and advocated unilateral evangelization based on anti-communism. This approach prioritized contact with underground churches and broadcast missions into the North​.\n\nDialogue-based Missiology: Progressive churches adopted ecumenical theological frameworks and emphasized exchange and cooperation with North Korean churches. Through partnership with global Christian institutions, they supported a theology of peaceful reunification​.\n\nAbsorption-oriented Mission Strategy: Following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, some conservative churches anticipated the fall of North Korea and promoted a \"North Korean Church Reconstruction Movement.\" They prepared plans to reestablish churches in North Korea, assuming that unification would follow a South-led model. Some of these efforts continue to this day.\n\n\nOver the course of the 1980s, South Korea gradually shifted from absorption-type unification to phased negotiation, while North Korea maintained its federal proposal as a means of securing regime survival. Within this landscape, religious institutions in both Koreas emerged not as passive objects of policy but as active agents shaping the direction and ethical contours of unification strategies.\n\nProgressive churches in South Korea formulated independent unification theologies, promoted reconciliation, and created moral and spiritual spaces for inter-Korean dialogue.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea utilized the Korean Christian Federation as a buffer channel for international diplomacy, engaging with global churches and reframing religion as a potential contributor to both humanitarian relief and political legitimacy. These developments in the 1980s laid critical groundwork for continued religious engagement in unification and cross-border humanitarian exchanges in the following decades.\n\n\nKorean Protestant Church Growth and Democratization in the 1980s\n\nThe 1980s marked a paradoxical era in South Korean history—a time of both explosive church growth and deep national division under military dictatorship. While the country underwent rapid urbanization, economic development, and authoritarian rule, the Korean Protestant Church expanded rapidly through its decentralized cell structures, spiritual revival movements, and strategic evangelical programs. At the center of this expansion were megachurches like Yoido Full Gospel Church and SaRang Community Church, which mobilized lay leadership through systematic discipleship training and mass evangelism events.\n\nThe theological framework known as the 'Threefold Blessing'—salvation, health, and material prosperity—developed by Rev. Yonggi Cho, became not only a doctrinal hallmark but also a sociocultural response to the post-war, post-colonial anxiety of the Korean people. Churches have become spaces of emotional healing, community rebuilding, and economic hope. The widespread use of prayer mountains, all-night vigils, testimonies of healing, and tongues-speaking illustrated a religiosity rooted in experience and response, rather than abstract belief systems. Weekly worship was not just liturgy, it was emotional catharsis and social support system rolled into one.\n\nMeanwhile, progressive churches aligned with democratization struggles, especially those affiliated with the Korean Christian Church Council (NCCK), the Christian Industrial Mission, and campus groups like KSCF. These churches played pivotal roles in advocating human rights and resisting authoritarianism. However, they did not experience the same numerical growth as the conservative evangelical churches. The latter, by contrast, maintained either politically neutral or cooperative relationships with the regime, positioning themselves as spiritual sanctuaries amid repression.\n\nWhile these two tracks—socially engaged churches and megachurch growth—operated largely in parallel, their influence reshaped Korean Protestantism. Evangelical churches systematized growth via small groups, prayer networks, and mass events, while activist churches expanded theology and public witness. Both contributed to the complex religious ecology of 1980s Korea.\n\n\nTable 1.

Particularly under President Kim Young-sam, religious policies became increasingly biased toward Protestant Christianity, leading to a strong backlash from the Buddhist community and cautious responses from the Catholic Church.\n\nAs an elder of the Presbyterian Church, Kim regularly held family worship services in the presidential residence and even attended services at the National Army Central Church in his official capacity as president. These actions, widely reported in the media, signaled a fusion of public authority and private faith, raising serious concerns about the violation of state neutrality and the principle of separation between religion and state. In response, the Buddhist community vocally protested. The military chaplaincy system, limited to Protestants and Catholics, excluded other faiths such as Buddhism and Won Buddhism, fueling further accusations of institutional discrimination.\n\nThis imbalance was also evident in religious administrative practices. Government platforms such as the “AlGoga” public transit information system and educational geography databases omitted data on Buddhist temples, causing the Buddhist leadership to denounce such omissions as systemic discrimination rather than clerical error. Though the peak of public protest would erupt in 2008 under the Lee Myung-bak administration, the root of this tension can be traced back to the policy patterns of the 1990s.\n\nMeanwhile, Protestant churches strengthened their institutional ties with the state through events like the National Breakfast Prayer Meeting and the National Assembly Prayer Meeting. Throughout the 1990s, top political figures met regularly with Protestant leaders to discuss state affairs, which Protestant communities interpreted as prayer for national leadership, but which outside observers saw as collusion between church and state. One striking incident was the cancellation of the Buddhist-themed cultural park in Palgong Mountain in Daegu due to coordinated opposition by Protestant organizations, highlighting the unequal political clout among religious groups.\n\nThe Catholic Church took a more measured approach in the 1990s, drawing upon its legacy of democratic and human rights advocacy from the 1980s. Under the leadership of Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan, the Church refrained from direct political opposition, focusing instead on independent civic activism in areas such as social welfare, labor rights, and human dignity. Unlike Buddhism or Protestantism, which often asserted religious authority in public affairs, the Catholic Church emphasized trust and solidarity with civil society as its basis for influence.\n\n\nTable 1. Religious Policy and Religious Group Responses\n\n| Year | Event or Policy | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1994 | President Kim attends worship at Army Central Church | Public presidential religious activity triggers Buddhist protest |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996 | Regional religious broadcasting controversy | Religious broadcasting licenses heavily skewed toward Protestant groups |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998 | Buddhist cultural park in Palgong Mountain canceled | Project halted due to strong Protestant opposition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999 | Buddhist temples omitted from public databases | Repeated omission of temple data raises allegations of systemic discrimination |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Early 1990s | Chaplaincy reform disputes | Buddhists and Won Buddhists excluded from military chaplaincy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nReligious Tax Controversy\n\nIn the 1990s, as South Korea experienced a surge in public demands for institutional transparency and accountability following democratization, a longstanding issue—the tax exemption of clergy—entered the national spotlight. For decades, religious figures such as pastors, priests, and monks were effectively excluded from income taxation, with the state treating their honoraria, donations, and ministry allowances as non-taxable. This practice had been based on the premise of protecting religious autonomy, allowing religious institutions to operate with minimal interference. However, the 1990s saw increasing public criticism of this exceptional treatment.\n\nThe controversy was fueled by media reports revealing that some megachurches and well-known clergy were amassing substantial wealth through real estate investments, large-scale construction projects, and financial assets. In response, the National Tax Service (NTS) took a passive stance. In 1992, the NTS officially declared that \"taxation will be left to the discretion of religious figures,\" effectively announcing its intention not to impose income tax on clergy. This decision, grounded in custom rather than law, provoked backlash from civil society, which argued that tax exemption for a privileged group violated the constitutional principle that “all citizens shall have the duty to pay taxes.”\n\nProgressive religious circles, including the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) and the Catholic Justice and Peace Committee, acknowledged the legitimacy of taxation in principle. However, more conservative Protestant denominations and large churches vehemently opposed it. They insisted that taxation would violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and state and interpreted it as state control over faith. Some religious leaders even framed taxation as government persecution, organizing rallies, issuing public declarations, and threatening electoral retaliation.\n\nAt the same time, emerging movements within and outside the church began to assert that clergy taxation could serve as a corrective mechanism for financial corruption and undemocratic governance within religious institutions. New organizations like the “Church Financial Transparency Movement” called on religious groups to embrace taxation as a path to social credibility. Public dissatisfaction also grew, especially among nonreligious citizens, who criticized the special treatment of clergy as an emblem of structural inequality.\n\nThe political response was cautious. Given the electoral influence of religious groups, politicians were reluctant to push for reforms. One lawmaker in 1994 publicly stated that he had been threatened with a campaign of opposition from a major church for supporting clergy taxation. Thus, the taxation controversy was not merely a matter of fiscal administration but a deeply symbolic confrontation over the role of religion in the democratic public sphere. It involved intersecting questions of religious autonomy, political complicity, public trust, and the legitimacy of state authority.\n\nThough the issue remained unresolved throughout the 1990s, it did initiate a shift in public attitudes. Internal calls for self-regulation began to emerge in some churches. A few congregations started publicly disclosing financial audits and formalizing compensation standards. The clergy taxation debate marked the first serious challenge to the informal legal immunity that religious institutions had long enjoyed. This challenge ultimately laid the groundwork for policy changes in the 2010s, when the South Korean government began implementing a formal taxation system for clergy in 2018.\n\n\nEducation Related Policy\n\nIn the 1990s, South Korea’s public education system stood at a transitional moment as it sought to redefine its relationship with religious education—particularly Christian instruction. The Constitution and the Education Act of the Republic of Korea had long explicitly prohibited religious education in public schools. Article 5 of the Education Act, revised and enforced in 1995, reaffirmed this principle by stipulating that “no religious education shall be conducted in national or public schools for the benefit of any religion.” This provision reinforced religious neutrality as a constitutional value the state must uphold and institutionalized the principle of secularism within public education.\n\nDespite this foundational principle, the 1990s marked a period in which religious education began to be partially institutionalized in public schools. A notable example is the introduction of the subject “Religion” in the 6th National Curriculum, announced in 1992, for middle and high schools. Rather than focusing on the doctrines of a specific religion, this course was designed as part of a general liberal education that introduced various religious cultures. The Ministry of Education set the objective as providing “a broad understanding of the major world religions and traditional Korean religions.” As a result, the course was structured around a cultural approach that explored themes such as humanity, religion, and the meaning of life, rather than centering on churches or the Bible. This trend continued with the 7th National Curriculum announced in 1997. To guide the implementation of this subject, the Ministry of Education developed specific instructional guidelines under the theme: “How can religious values relate to modern life?” Consequently, religion textbooks were revised to encourage reflection on existential issues such as suffering, justice, life, and death, rather than promoting any particular religion.\n\nHowever, the institutionalization of religious education triggered significant controversy. Central to the debate was the conflict between religious (private) and public schools regarding the mode of religious education. Some Christian schools sought to maintain their existing worship and Bible-centered instruction, while Buddhist groups and general parents expressed concern about potential religious bias in public education. Educational scholars and civil organizations pointed out the “legal ambiguity surrounding the introduction of religion as a subject and the mixture of doctrinal and cultural content,” voicing their concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, different standards were applied to religious activities in private schools. In one case, South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that requiring chapel attendance as a graduation requirement at a private Christian university was not unconstitutional. In a 1998 decision, the court stated that such a requirement was “intended for the cultivation of well-rounded individuals and does not unduly infringe upon students’ freedom of religion.” This ruling established a legal precedent acknowledging the right of religious foundations to maintain a degree of religious identity in operating private schools.\n\nDuring this period, the Ministry of Education and local education offices repeatedly issued administrative directives affirming that “compulsory worship or prayer is not allowed in public schools.” In fact, some complaints were filed regarding the imposition of religious activities. The 1990s, therefore, represent a complex period during which religious education in public schools was negotiated between legal principles and practical realities. The defining feature of this era was the beginning of limited yet formalized inclusion of religion—including Christianity—into the structure of public education.\n\n\nTable 1. Institutional and Policy Shifts in Education\n\n| Decade | Public Education (Primary & Secondary) | Christian Private Universities |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950s | Public schools maintained constitutional and legal religious neutrality; religious education and worship were explicitly banned. | Yonsei University (1957) and Soongsil University (1954) reestablished with Christian mottos and chapel systems. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960s | No official religious subjects in the curriculum; worship or religious education remained prohibited in public schools. | Yonsei established its Office of the Chaplain (1962); Myongji University accredited as a Christian university (1967). |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970s | 1970 Ministry of Education directive banned religious education and worship during class hours. | Christian identity strengthened—Myongji (1972) officially adopted Christian values; Yonsei continued its chapel and Christian-based education. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980s | The Framework Act on Education codified the ban on specific religious instruction in public schools. | Luce Chapel completed (Yonsei, 1974); Soongsil emphasized Christian service; chapel and Christian curriculum institutionalized. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990s | The 1990 Framework Act on Education reaffirmed religious neutrality; religious subjects remained excluded from the curriculum. | Christian identity maintained under increasing state regulation; Yonsei's bylaws allowed denominational board appointments. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1990s, the relationship between Christianity and public education in South Korea evolved through a series of legal, institutional, and cultural shifts. While the state upheld religious neutrality in public education throughout these decades, Christian-affiliated private institutions—especially universities such as Yonsei, Soongsil, and Myongji—maintained their religious identity and mission through varying policies and legal frameworks.\n\nIn the 1950s, shortly after the Korean War, the state reestablished public education based on constitutional principles, one of which was the separation of religion and education in state-funded schools. The Education Act, reflecting these values, prohibited religious education and worship within public schools. However, Christian universities, which had often been established by foreign missionaries during the colonial or pre-war era, reemerged with a clear commitment to their founding values. Yonsei University, formed in 1957 through the merger of Severance Union Medical College and Chosun Christian University, adopted the motto “The truth will set you free,” affirming its evangelical mission. Soongsil University reopened in 1954, also grounded in a vision of Christian service and national reconstruction. Weekly chapel services and Christian leadership education were institutionalized as part of their curricula.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Korean state maintained its strict position on religious neutrality in public schools, and no formal religious subject was included in the national curriculum. Nevertheless, Christian universities expanded their structures for spiritual formation. Yonsei formally established its Office of the Chaplain in 1962, solidifying its chapel system and campus ministry. Myongji University, founded by the Christian Holiness Church, received accreditation as a four-year university in 1967. These universities continued to emphasize Christian values in their governance, educational objectives, and student life.\n\nThe 1970s saw a more explicit enforcement of religious neutrality in public schools. In 1970, the Ministry of Education issued a formal directive banning worship services and religious instruction during school hours. This reflected growing concerns about fairness and pluralism within an increasingly diverse society. However, Christian private universities moved in the opposite direction, reaffirming their religious identity in response to rapid modernization. For instance, Myongji University merged with Kwandong University in 1972 and officially defined “Christian character formation” as part of its educational mission. Yonsei, too, preserved its Christian heritage through symbols, governance structures, and worship life, including the continued use of chapel services and Christian-based general education.\n\nIn the 1980s, these trends became more institutionalized. With the enactment of the Framework Act on Education in the late 1980s, the legal ban on religious instruction in public schools was codified. This reinforced the separation of religion from state-run education. Nonetheless, Christian universities deepened their religious formation programs. Yonsei University completed the Luce Chapel in 1974 and maintained regular worship, while Soongsil emphasized its founding motto, “Truth and Service,” as a guiding philosophy in both liberal arts and leadership education.\n\nBy the 1990s, the public education system had fully embraced the principle of religious neutrality. The Framework Act on Education, implemented in 1990, formally stated that no public educational institution should engage in religious instruction or religious discrimination. However, Christian universities continued to develop under a dual framework: they maintained their founding mission, while also complying with increasing governmental regulation on accreditation, faculty hiring, and curriculum standards. For example, the bylaws of Yonsei University included provisions for denominational church representatives to serve as members of the board of trustees, reflecting both legal recognition of their identity and negotiation with state policies.\n\nOverall, this five-decade trajectory shows a consistent divide between public education and religious neutrality on the one hand, and the sustained religious identity of Christian private institutions on the other. Christian-affiliated universities were not merely religious in origin but continuously reasserted their mission through institutional governance, worship practices, and character formation education—marking them as unique actors in South Korea’s evolving educational landscape.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nNorth Korea’s religious policy in the 1990s appeared on the surface to be gradually liberalizing through renewed international exchanges and the existence of official churches, yet in reality, it was deeply embedded in Juche ideology and a system of authoritarian control. Following the establishment of Bongsu Church and Jangchung Cathedral in the late 1980s, the regime continued throughout the 1990s to showcase these religious institutions as evidence of “religious freedom.” In truth, these churches were tightly controlled by the Ministry of State Security and served more as instruments of propaganda than spaces for authentic worship.\n\nUnder Kim Jong-il, the regime departed from Kim Il-sung’s ambiguous tolerance of religious-humanist parallels, instead transforming Juche into a leadership-centered orthodoxy that intensified the suppression of religion. Religious adherents were labeled as “impure elements” and classified into the lower class under the songbun system, barring them from education, employment, and Party membership. Underground church activities often led to execution or incarceration in political prison camps.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1990s, as many North Koreans returned from China after experiencing Christianity during the “Arduous March” famine, small-scale underground churches formed within family circles. These, too, were subject to harsh crackdowns, surveillance, torture, and arrests. Meanwhile, the regime used the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) to expand contact with South Korean Protestant groups and international organizations like the World Council of Churches (WCC). These efforts, however, were guided not by a genuine interest in interfaith dialogue but by propaganda and the strategic objectives of the United Front. In sum, North Korea’s religious policy in the 1990s was not designed to accommodate or recognize religion internally, but rather to maximize its diplomatic utility and ideological control.\n\n\nUnification Policies\n\nDuring the 1990s, the unification policies of North and South Korea evolved in response to the collapse of the Cold War order and shifting global dynamics. South Korea, under President Roh Tae-woo, initiated a “Nordpolitik” (Northern Policy) that culminated in the 1991 Basic Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, and Exchange. This agreement pursued gradual unification based on mutual cooperation and peaceful coexistence. President Kim Young-sam later reinforced this approach but emphasized unification under a liberal democratic system. In contrast, North Korea—undergoing leadership transition after Kim Il-sung’s death—promoted the principle of national self-determination and proposed a “low-level federation” model grounded in autonomy, peace, and national solidarity.\n\nAmid these developments, religion—particularly Korean Christianity—emerged not merely as a passive observer but as an active agent of engagement and dialogue. The National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued its landmark 1988 “Declaration on the Peace and Reunification of the Korean People,” formally recognizing the principles of the 7.4 Joint Statement and the 1991 Basic Agreement. Throughout the 1990s, the NCCK facilitated inter-Korean religious exchanges, organized prayer meetings, and visited Pyongyang, positioning the church as a moral voice in the national unification discourse.\n\nNorth Korea, for its part, utilized religion—specifically through the Korean Christian Federation (KCF)—as a strategic tool for diplomacy. The regime sought to enhance its international image by permitting limited religious contact with the South, including co-authored inter-Korean prayer texts and official worship services at Bongsu Church. However, this form of engagement was carefully curated and served more as a propaganda device than a genuine expression of religious freedom.\n\nThus, unification policy in the 1990s advanced in parallel along ideological lines, yet allowed limited symbolic and cultural interactions. Religion served not merely as a tool of propaganda or compliance, but as a medium for inter-Korean cooperation and as a moral and symbolic resource in the quest for national unity.\n\n\nComprehensive Analysis of the Growth and Decline of Korean Protestantism and Catholicism\n\n\nThe 1990s was a pivotal decade in the religious history of South Korea. This period witnessed both the peak and the beginning of a transition for Korean Christianity—Protestantism and Catholicism alike. The sociopolitical landscape was rapidly evolving with the consolidation of democracy, the spread of neoliberal reforms, the rise of consumer individualism, and the dramatic economic collapse following the 1997 IMF crisis. In this context, religious institutions served not only spiritual functions but also became key actors in education, welfare, social ethics, and identity formation. This report presents a comprehensive synthesis of multiple academic studies that examined the multifaceted growth and subsequent stagnation or decline of these two major religious traditions in Korea throughout the 1990s.\n\n\nGrowth Factors and Processes: Protestantism\n\nProtestant megachurches rapidly expanded in the 1990s, particularly in urbanized and affluent areas like Gangnam. This growth was driven by the strategic acquisition of land during the 1980s, coupled with increasing inflow of middle-class families seeking education, stability, and community. Churches implemented diversified ministry models including cell ministry, charismatic worship, youth-oriented outreach, and multimedia services. Churches like A, B, and C (as case studies show) achieved exponential increases in membership and annual budgets, developing complex church campuses with sanctuaries, education halls, and welfare centers. Additionally, worship spaces transformed architecturally: sanctuaries shifted from linear layouts to fan-shaped and sloped auditoriums to ensure visual engagement and participation. This physical expansion supported the theological emphasis on community, evangelism, and active lay participation.\n\n\nGrowth Factors and Processes: Catholicism\n\nCatholicism grew significantly in public trust and influence, partly due to its role in pro-democracy movements in the 1980s and its consistent advocacy for human rights. Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan emerged as a moral authority. Catholic organizations invested heavily in pastoral work for the marginalized—laborers, farmers, the urban poor, and youth. During the IMF crisis, the Catholic Church took symbolic and material leadership in national recovery efforts, most famously through the gold donation campaign. In terms of facilities, churches expanded welfare programs, educational missions, and lay formation. The Church emphasized values of solidarity, social responsibility, and ecological ethics, which resonated with parts of the population disillusioned by materialism and political instability.\n\n\nTable 2.

Some megachurches were seen as overly commercialized, eroding their moral authority. Generational divides deepened as younger Koreans left the church in search of more inclusive, less hierarchical spaces or distanced themselves from organized religion altogether. The consumer orientation of ministry—emphasizing comfort, success, and self-improvement—raised questions about theological depth and institutional priorities. Moreover, aggressive competition among denominations and a decline in campus ministry further signaled weakening influence among youth.\n\n\nDecline Factors and Structural Challenges: Catholicism\n\nWhile Catholicism maintained relatively high public trust, it too faced stagnation. Its highly centralized clerical structure limited lay leadership and innovation. Youth engagement slowed, and many viewed Catholic worship and doctrines as less accessible or relevant. Despite active social justice efforts, the institutional inertia and traditional hierarchy hindered long-term growth and adaptability. By the late 1990s, both traditions had reached an inflection point—popular in public life, yet increasingly distant from emerging generations and shifting cultural values.\n\nTable 3. Decline Factors and Structural Variables\n\n| Category | Protestantism | Catholicism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Political Alignment | Some pastors' political alignment and public statements → decline in trust | Generally refrained from political speech but aligned with social justice |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Perception | Commercialization, lack of financial transparency | Perceived as conservative and institutional by outsiders |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Generational Gap | Youth disengagement, weakened college ministry | Active youth pastoral efforts but aging population and secularization |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Internal Structure | Inheritance controversies, denominational competition | Clericalism, limited lay participation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nSocial Responses and Religious Perception\n\nSouth Korean society in the 1990s responded to religion with both appreciation and skepticism. Religious institutions were valued for their contributions to welfare, community support, and national recovery—especially during the 1997–98 financial crisis. However, increasing reports of internal corruption, lack of transparency, and political entanglement prompted critical public discourse. Religious spaces became multifunctional hubs—serving educational, counseling, and cultural roles. Many churches opened facilities to local communities, which helped bridge social fragmentation in rapidly urbanized districts. Catholicism’s association with civil society activism further strengthened its credibility. Nonetheless, the rise of individualism and secularization—especially among the youth—meant that institutional religion faced a long-term decline in authority. Both Protestant and Catholic churches struggled to adapt to a landscape where spiritual affiliation was increasingly seen as personal, voluntary, and pluralistic rather than institutional and collective.\n\n\n\n\n\n（1）西來庵事件\n\n\nIn 1915, Yu Qingfang and others initiated an anti-Japanese movement known as the Xilai An Incident (or Tapani Incident). Initially, it started under the guise of a religious uprising but later evolved into a large-scale peasant revolt against the government's exploitation of forests and lands. During this time, the Tapani Church (the predecessor of the Yujing Church) experienced significant upheaval. Twenty-two local believers were arrested, with seven sentenced to death, twelve to life imprisonment, and only three released. The church was occupied by officials for several months, causing considerable disruption. Fortunately, the label of a \"religious uprising\" gradually faded, and the incident eventually came to an end.\n\n\n1915年，余清芳等人發起抗日運動，史稱西來庵事件（噍吧哖事件）。初期以宗教之名起事，但後來則演變成農民對政府山林園野收奪的大規模抗爭。當時，噍吧哖教會（玉井教會前身）曾歷經震盪，當地有22名信徒被捕，其中7人極刑、12人無期徒刑，僅3人獲釋，教堂亦被官方佔用數月，造成很大的困擾。幸而「宗教起義」之名已經淡化，事件也漸漸落幕。\n\n\n### Religious Investigation\n\n\n#### Post-Xilai An Incident Religious Investigation\n\n\nAfter the Xilai An Incident, the Governor-General's Office conducted three religious investigations between 1915 and 1918 to \"improve religious superstitions, identify conspiratorial groups, and maintain social order.\" In 1919, the project leader Marui Keijiro 丸井圭治郎, based on the investigation reports from the six departments and temple ledgers, proposed the \"Taiwan Religious Investigation Report (Volume One).\"\n\n\n**(2) Religious Investigation**\n\n\nAfter the Xilai An Incident, the Governor-General's Office conducted three religious investigations from 1915 to 1918 to \"improve religious superstitions, expose conspiracy groups, and maintain social order.\" In 1919, the project leader, Keiichiro Marui, based on investigation reports from the six bureaus and temple registers, presented the *Taiwan Religious Investigation Report (Volume One)*.\n\n\n（2）宗教調查\n\n西來庵事件後，總督府為「改善宗教迷信、糾舉陰謀團體、維護社會治安」，於1915-1918年進行三次宗教調查。1919年，計畫主持者丸井圭治郎根據六廳之調查報告與寺廟臺帳，提出《臺灣宗教調查報告書（第一卷）》。\n\n\nDue to relatively amicable relations between the authorities and missionaries, Christianity seldom incited the populace, and church records were easy to obtain, posing less of a threat to the government. Therefore, the investigation mainly focused on \"traditional beliefs.\" In March 1917, influenced by the religious investigation, the southern churches, led by Liu Junchen and others, began to establish a \"foundation.\" In December, Kono Masayoshi, Liu Xiwu, Liu Ruishan, and Yan Zhensheng jointly submitted an application, including documents such as the act of donation, property list, transfer deeds, and church constitution. The Governor-General's Office approved it in July 1918. In other words, the southern churches had completed their own statistical overview of church affairs before the government's religious investigation.\n\n\n由於當局和宣教師關係不惡，基督教少有「煽動」百姓的情事，教會的文書名冊也容易掌握，對政府較無威脅，因此調查的重點主要在於「舊慣信仰」。直到1917年3月，受到宗教調查的影響，南部教會託劉俊臣等籌設「財團法人」，12月由河野政喜、劉錫五、劉瑞山、顏振聲聯名提出申請書，附件有寄附行為、財產目錄、承讓書、教會憲法等文件，旋於1918年7月獲得總督府許可，換言之，南部教會已經先於政府的宗教調查，完成本身的教勢概況統計。\n\n\nThe southern churches, initially passively accepting official regulations, gained practical experience through several property and tax disputes. The early Japanese colonial religious investigations provided the Governor-General's Office with a better understanding and control of Christianity. The \"temple ledgers\" already recorded the numbers of \"church offices, preaching places, and missionaries,\" with detailed records of missionary activities and the rise and fall of religions. The Governor-General's Office also recognized the development potential of Christianity.\n\n\n南部教會從被動接受官方規章，而在數次產權、租稅爭議協調中獲得實務經驗。日治初期的宗教調查使總督府對基督教更為瞭解、掌握，「寺廟臺帳」已有記載「教務所、說教所、布教師」等數字，尤其是布教情形與宗教消長，都有詳細的紀錄。總督府也認為基督教具有發展潛力。\n\n\nFor local churches, the \"Evangelical Society,\" which expanded church affairs in various regions, was integrated into the \"Missionary Charity Society,\" unifying the previously disorganized and incoherent system, enhancing the efficiency of evangelism and relief efforts, and ensuring proper use of donations. The 1915 Xilai An Incident prompted the Governor-General's Office to commission Marui Keijiro to conduct a religious investigation, but its primary focus was on traditional religious practices and the psychological impact of folk beliefs on the Taiwanese people, with less emphasis on Christianity. Triggered by the religious investigation, the southern churches simultaneously carried out internal integration, established a \"foundation,\" and obtained legal recognition. Evidently, church-state relations entered a new phase.\n\n\n對地方教會而言，各地拓展教務的「宣道會」整合成為「佈教慈善會」，更能統一紊亂缺乏條理的制度，增進布教賑濟效率，使募款能妥善利用。1915年的西來庵事件爆發，促使總督府委任丸井圭治郎展開宗教調查，但是其主要目標偏向舊慣宗教的調查以及民間信仰對臺灣人心理層面的影響，較少討論基督教的部分。在宗教調查的觸動下，南部教會同時進行內部整合，設立「財團法人」，獲得法律上的確認。顯然的，政教關係步入新的階段。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) Announcement No. 2 regarding the rituals held at the shrine on the day of the Crown Prince’s wedding ceremony [Taisho 13, January 25, 1924]\n\n有關皇太子結婚典禮當日於神社所舉行之祭祀事宜【大正13年1月25日】 告示第二號\n\n\"In addition to the issuance of this announcement, it is stipulated that on this day, civil and military high-ranking officials, titled individuals, members of the House of Peers, members of the House of Representatives, members of the Governor-General's Council, members of the Prefectural Council, members of the City Council, those with rank of Sixth Court Rank or Sixth Order of Merit or higher, senior representatives of civil and military officials, representatives of town and village leaders, representatives of all religious sects, and representatives of the people shall assemble at the first torii of the Taiwan Shrine at 11:40 a.m., dressed appropriately.\"\n\n另頒布本告示，規定當日文武高等官、有爵位者、貴族院議員、眾議院議員、總督府評議會員、州協議會員、市協議會員、從六位勳六等功五級以上者、文武判任官總代表、街庄長總代表、宗教各宗各派總代表、人民總代表，於是日上午十一時四十分，穿著適當服裝，集合於臺灣神社第一鳥居前。」\n\nThis refers to the wedding ceremony of Crown Prince Hirohito, later Emperor Showa, who married Princess Nagako, the eldest daughter of Prince Kuniyoshi Kuni, on January 26, Taisho 13 (1924). The announcement required representatives from various sectors in Taiwan, including representatives of all religious sects, to attend the rituals held at the Taiwan Shrine (Wen Guoliang 2001: 198-199; Wen Guoliang 2000: 326-327).\n\n「即裕仁皇太子，後來之昭和天皇，於大正13年（1924年）1月26日與久邇宮邦彦王長女良子舉行結婚典禮，規定在台各界包括宗教各宗派總代表出席在臺灣神社的祭祀事宜（溫國良2001：198-199；溫國良2000：326-327）。\n\nOrdinance No. 74 on the Salary Regulations for Priests of Shrines Below Prefectural Shrines [Taisho 13, September 9] [A government order on the rules for stipends for clergy at shrines below the county level]\n\n縣社以下神社神職俸給規則府令案——府令第七十四號[縣社以下神社神職人員俸給規則府令案] 【大正13年9月9日】 \n\n\n**Salary Regulations for Priests of Shrines Below Prefectural Shrines**\n\n「縣社以下神社神職人員俸給規則\n\n\n**Article 1:** The salaries of priests of shrines below the prefectural level shall be paid by the shrine in accordance with the attached schedule.\n\n第一條 縣社以下神社神職人員之俸給應依附表由神社支給之。\n\n\n**Article 2:** Shrine priests (Shashi) and assistant priests (Shasho) shall not receive salary increases for less than one year of service in each rank, except for those receiving salaries of sixth rank or below.\n\n第二條 社司、社掌每級在職未滿一年以上，不得增給；但領六級俸以下者，不在此限。 \n\n\n**Article 3:** Shrine priests and assistant priests who have served for more than five years in one rank with outstanding performance may receive a special allowance of up to fifty yen per month.\n\n第三條 社司、社掌在職五年以上，職內領一級俸而成績優良者，得特別加給月額五十圓以內。\n\n\n**Article 4:** For shrine priests and assistant priests with salaries below the sixth rank, an appropriate amount may be set and paid regardless of rank; however, it shall not be less than the minimum salary amount set for each position.\n\n第四條 以社司、社掌之俸給在六級俸以下者為限，可不限級俸，訂定適當之金額支給之；但不得給與各所所定之最低俸給額。\n\n\n**Article 5:** In shrines with more than two assistant priests, some may be designated as honorary positions.

They therefore established the \"Taiwan Parliament Establishment Alliance\" and sought to apply for association registration with the police department. However, this application was rejected based on Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the \"Public Security Police Law\" announced on February 2 of the same year. Chiang Wei-shui moved the headquarters to Tokyo, with Lin Cheng-lu as the initiator, and applied for association registration with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The \"Taiwan Parliament Establishment Alliance,\" which had been banned in Taipei, was approved for establishment in Tokyo. \n\n1923年1月，蔣渭水等臺灣文化協會中的非左派人士感到臺灣議會設置請願運動的發展已見瓶頸，於是改立「臺灣議會期成同盟會」，擬向警察署提出結社申請。但這項申請被同年2月2日公布的「治安警察法」第八條第一項為由駁回。蔣渭水將總部移至東京，以林呈祿為發起人，向東京警察署提出結社申請，在台北被禁止的「臺灣議會期成同盟會」獲准成立。\n\nThis move angered the Police Department of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, and on December 16 of the same year, under the direction of Taipei District Court Prosecutor Miyoshi Ichihachi, Chiang Wei-shui and 49 others were prosecuted again under Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the \"Public Security Police Law.\" The following August, all were acquitted, but Chiang Wei-shui, Cai Peihuo, Chen Fengyuan, Cai Huiru, and 10 others were indicted again. Among them, Cai Peihuo was a Christian who had met Pastor Uemura Masahisa in 1917 and was baptized in 1920, joining Uemura's Fujimicho Church of the Japanese Christian Church. Uemura's connections allowed Cai to engage with Japanese political figures, and many of the \"introducing parliamentarians\" supporting the petition movement for the establishment of a Taiwanese parliament were connected through Uemura. Uemura not only lent the church for political speeches by Taiwanese but also introduced Lin Hsien-tang and Cai Peihuo to political figures.\n\n但此舉激怒臺灣總督府警務局，遂於同年12月16日在台北地方法院檢察官三好一八指揮下，再以「治安警察法」第八條第二項將蔣渭水在內49人檢舉起訴。隔年8月，全體人員獲判無罪，但蔣渭水、蔡培火、陳逢源、蔡惠如等14人再度被起訴。其中蔡培火是基督徒，他在1917年認識植村正久牧師，在1920年受洗，加入植村主持的日本基督教會富士見町教會，也因為植村的人脈，使他得以接觸日本政界人士，蔡培火所投入議會設置請願運動在日本表達支持的「介紹議員」大部分即是透過植村的關係。植村不但出借教會供臺灣人政治演講，更介紹林獻堂、蔡培火會晤政要。\n\nOn October 29, 1924, the aforementioned 14 individuals were convicted by the Taipei District Court of violating Article 23, Paragraph 2 of the \"Public Security Police Law.\" Cai Peihuo was sentenced to five months in prison but was actually sentenced to four months. He was imprisoned on February 21, 1925, and released on May 10. Among the 14, Han Shih-chuan later became a Christian in 1930, and he was only fined 100 yen at that time (Shi Ming 2014: 513, 517; Suehiro Shinya 2012: 257; Wang Zhaowen 2009: 94, 98-99; Chou Wan-yao 2011: 17-18).\n\n1924年10月29日，上述14人經台北地方法院判決，確定違反「治安警察法」第二十三條第二項，而被判有罪。蔡培火被求刑五個月，但被判四個月，1925年2月21日入監，5月10日出獄。14人當中韓石泉而後在1930年也成為基督徒，而他當時僅被判罰金百元（史明2014：513、517；末光欣也2012：257；王昭文2009：94、98-99；周婉窈2011：17-18）。\n\n\n\n**(1) National Mobilization Law**\n\n\nIn the mid-Meiji period, the Japanese government attempted to legislate to unify and regulate religious activities. Although the Meiji Constitution guaranteed religious freedom, the state still retained the authority to control public religion, claiming that legislative regulation fell within a reasonable scope. Traditional Japanese religions, mainly Buddhism, believed that legalizing religious organizations would elevate the status of Christianity, reducing the relative advantage of traditional religions. Consequently, they obstructed the legislative process, causing the bill to be repeatedly rejected by the National Diet in 1899, 1927, and 1929.\n\n\n（1）國家總動員法\n\n明治中期，日本政府企圖透過立法統一規範宗教活動。明治憲法雖規定宗教自由，但國家仍有節制大眾宗教之權，因此政府聲稱立法管制屬於合理的範圍內。以佛教界為主的日本傳統宗教認為，若將宗教團體法制化，基督教的位階將會提高，縮減傳統宗教相對優勢的地位，因此阻撓立法過程，致使該草案於1899、1927、1929年屢次被國會駁回。\n\n\nRegarding policies on Christianity, the Japanese government only granted legitimacy in 1899 through the Ministry of Home Affairs Order No. 41, \"Regulations on the Announcement and Establishment of Religious Buildings for Religions Other Than Shinto and Buddhism,\" incorporating it into the management of religious administration. However, religious activities and the establishment of churches still required permission and investigation by the Ministry of Education and local authorities. Thus, while Christianity became a legal religion, it remained under state supervision and control.\n\n關於基督教的政策，1899年日本政府以內務省令第41號〈關於神佛道以外的宗教宣布及堂宇會堂等之規定〉中，才獲得合法性，納入宗教行政之管理。惟宗教活動與教會的設立仍須受文部省及地方官廳的許可、調查。因此基督教雖然成為合法的宗教，卻受到國家的監督統制。\n\n\nIn the 1930s, with the rise of fascism, from the February 26 Incident to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan became increasingly entrenched in war, leading to stricter control and repression of religion. In April 1938, the Japanese government promulgated Law No. 55, the National Mobilization Law, clearly stating that the nation had transitioned from a \"quasi-war period\" to a \"war period.\" To consolidate national defense and maximize national power, it was necessary to control and utilize all resources to achieve military objectives. Concerning civic organizations, the law's compulsory nature allowed the government to establish, merge, change, and abolish both homogeneous and heterogeneous enterprises and organizations or limit membership under control agreements. Additionally, the Japanese government had the authority to approve the conditions or regulations of organizational members and could increase control through imperial ordinances when necessary.\n\n\n1930年代，隨著法西斯主義高漲，從二二六事件至盧溝橋事變，日本陷在戰爭泥沼中，對宗教的管制與鎮壓日趨嚴厲。1938年4月，日本政府發佈法律第55號「國家總動員法」，明確指出國家已從「準戰爭時期」進入「戰爭時期」，為鞏固國防及發揮最大的國力，必須統制運用所有的資源，以達成軍事目的。在人民團體方面，基於法律的強制性，無論同質或異質的事業、團體，政府均得加以設立、合併、變更及廢止，或在統制協定之下限定加盟者。此外，日本政府亦對團體的組織成員的條件或是規程擁有認可權，必要時還可透過勅令增加控制權。\n\n\n**(2) Religious Organizations Law**\n\n\nIn 1939, with the aim of religious control, the Japanese government promulgated Law No. 77, the \"Religious Organizations Law.\" During the legislative process, as nationalism surged, opposition was suppressed. Prime Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma stated, \"To enable religion to fulfill its original function, protection and supervision are necessary. All religions must be integrated with our national ideology.\" Education Minister Sadao Araki emphasized in his proposal explanation, \"In extraordinary times, the state should supervise, control, protect, and nurture religion to make it more effectively align with wartime efforts. Therefore, the Religious Organizations Law is indispensable.\" Matsuo Nagazo, the Director of the Religious Bureau of the Ministry of Education, also declared, \"If religious organizations or their teachers spread doctrines that reject shrine worship or incite others to reject it, it clearly violates public order and harms public welfare, and they will be severely punished under this law.\" This illustrates that the Religious Organizations Law was essentially a wartime religious control decree.\n\n\n（2）宗教團體法\n\n1939年，日本政府以宗教統制為目的，發佈法律第77號〈宗教團體法〉，在法令制訂的過程中，因國家主義高漲，反對聲浪遭受壓制。首相平沼騏一郎表示：「欲使宗教發揮其本來之機能，必須給予保護監督。任何宗教皆須融合我國國體觀念之事。」文部大臣荒木貞夫則在提案的解釋中強調：「非常時期國家應對宗教進行監督、管制、保護與培育，使宗教更有效地配合戰爭，所以宗教團體法是不可或缺的。」文部省宗教局長松尾長造也說：「宗教團體及其教師若於教義上散佈拒絕神社祭拜或指使他人拒拜之行為，則明白違反安寧秩序、損害公益，將依本法處以嚴刑。」由上可知，〈宗教團體法〉實際上即為戰時體制的宗教統制法令。\n\n\nThe Religious Organizations Law consisted of 37 articles in total (Articles 29-37 being supplementary provisions). Chapter 1 stipulated that \"religious organizations\" were divided into five types: Shinto sects, Buddhist sects, Christian denominations, temples, and churches. The first three were organized religious groups, while the latter two referred to independent temples or churches. Chapter 2 defined \"religious associations\" as gatherings for the purpose of proclaiming religious doctrines and performing rituals, other than \"religious organizations,\" including folk religions. Chapter 3 prescribed \"penalties,\" including fines for \"violations of restrictions and prohibitions.\" Chapter 4 contained supplementary provisions, including the implementation date and the repeal of previous laws.\n\n〈宗教團體法〉全文共37條（第29-37條為附則），第一章規定「宗教團體」分為神道教派、佛教宗派、基督教教團、寺院、教會五種類型，前三者是有組織的宗教團體，後兩者指獨立的寺院或是教會。第二章規定的「宗教結社」，係指「宗教團體」以外，為宗教的教義宣布、儀式的執行等目的而聚集者，如民間宗教即屬之。第三章規定「罰則」，包括「制限禁止的違背」等罰金。第四章附則，即「經過規定」，包括施行日、舊法令的廢止等。\n\n\nThe law aimed to \"supervise and protect religious organizations to ensure their healthy development, contributing to society, promoting spiritual upliftment, and guiding thought, while preventing and stopping various harmful effects.\" The regulations clearly specified penalties and had coercive power. If, during the proclamation or execution of doctrines, there were violations of public order, citizen duties, legal orders, or public safety, penalties would be imposed. Article 26 stipulated that those who violated restrictions and prohibitions should be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for up to six months or fined up to 500 yen. Article 27 stipulated that those who violated association registration requirements should be fined up to 300 yen. Article 28 stipulated that those who violated corporate registration requirements should be fined up to 200 yen. Evidently, the law nearly encroached on the boundaries of religious freedom, and the fines were quite substantial.\n\n該法令旨在「監督保護宗教團體，使其能健全發展，貢獻於社會，有力促進精神作興及思想啟導，預防阻止種種的弊害發生」。法規內容明訂罰則，具有強制力，當宣布或執行教義時，若有違背安寧秩序、臣民義務、法律命令、公共安全等情事，將受到處分。第26條規定，違反制限禁止相關法令者應處6個月以下的懲役、禁錮或500圓以下的罰金。第27條規定，違反結社申請相關事項者應處300圓以下的罰金。第28條規定，違反法人登記相關事項者，應處200圓以下的罰金。顯然的，該法令幾乎觸及宗教自由的邊緣，罰金額度亦頗為高昂。\n\n\nThe Religious Organizations Law was officially implemented in May 1940. In September, the Ministry of Education convened a meeting with representatives of Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity under the theme \"Strategies for Religious Activities in Response to the Current Situation,\" urging internal mergers within each religion. Initially, Buddhism had 13 sects and 56 schools, but under the government's policy of \"merging into a single sect,\" it was reduced to 13 sects and 28 schools by 1941.\n\n1940年5月〈宗教團體法〉正式實施， 9月文部省召集神道、佛教、基督教的代表，以「因應目前時局之宗教活動策略」為題召開協議會，要求各宗教內部進行合併。佛教原有13宗56派，在政府「同一宗組合併唯一宗派」的方針下，1941年縮減為13宗28派。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this region was part of the Qing Empire, the foundational legal structure towards religion was the same as the rest of China. Briefly, religions and religious practices were divided into three groups: correct, illicit, and perverse (the first and last often translated as orthodox and heterodox). In reality, the greatest concern about religion was that it would prove to be a threat to public order, either by inciting violence, or by inviting evil forces from the spiritual realm. Since the early 1800s, Manchuria had begun receiving growing numbers of migrants from the North China Plain, and it was feared that among these migrants were carried the banned religions from that region. These fears were realized in the Zaili (Tsai-li) violence of the 1890s, which was tangentially connected to the group in North China, but only became violent in the northeast region (Shek, 1980)\n\n\nRegarding Christianity specifically, the legalization of mission after the 1872 Treaty of Tianjin, roughly coincided temporally with the opening of Manchuria itself. As such, there was relatively little conflict around illegal mission, as had been found in other places. Indeed, the new wave of missionaries had an advantage in the fact that many of the migrants to the region came from Hebei and Shandong, both of which had deep mission roots, especially in rural areas.\n\n\nIncreasing but parcelized of interest within Manchuria created zones of foreign influence (including settlement) and geographic safe zones for the development of Christianity. Notable are the Russian (here meaning empire, so inclusive of Lithuanian and Polish Jews and Catholics) sphere along the CER (China Eastern Railway, also called the Qing Eastern Railway) and the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) which was initially Russian, later ceded to Japan. Harbin and Dalian (Dalny) developed as key points along these two railways, and would become centers of expat Christianity, albeit generally not a missionary one, as the large Russian Orthodox population in Harbin largely served its own interests in terms of building and staffing churches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there was no change in the legal structure (with foreign mission still being legally permitted), the political setting changed dramatically after the Boxer suppression. The sidelining of the anti-foreign faction at court rippled throughout the country, such that many of the formerly anti-foreign “mandarins” that had been problematic for or oppressive of missionaries were either replaced or adopted a very different tone. The overall relations between state and missions became cordial or even helpful, but this was without a change in the legal framework. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis decade was the lowpoint of lawlessness in Manchuria, a situation that worked both for and against Christianity. Official attitudes were generally one of benevolent neglect. The goodwill of previous decade seems to have continued, but not translated into much beyond basic protection. In practical terms, there was no law towards religion, beyond a general sense of trying not to antagonize the foreigners. The greatest threat to the missions was the lack of order in the countryside, a situation that made difficult travel between sites, especially rural preaching and the rounds of ministry to Catholic villages. At the same time, it likely created a greater need for mission public services, such as educational and medical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchukuo never adopted a constitution, and its legal system relied less on codified law than on political edicts issued as needed, and judges who settled cases as they came up, often combining Chinese and Japanese law (which were already similar). The point being that the legal space was still somewhat inchoate. (DuBois 2010) There was direct inspiration for the administration of religion in Manchuria from the Japanese Peace Preservation Law (1937), but this again was not law as such. (Watanabe 1979)\n\n\nThe state of Christianity in Manchukuo closely tracked against events in Japan, although again largely on an episodic level that set political sentiment rather than writing black letter law. As in Japan, Manchukuo Christianity had detractors and supporters, the latter becoming vocal after a 1937 incident in which a group of students at Tokyo’s Sophia University refused, citing religious reasons, to participate in the reverence at the Yasukuni Shrine. This cast the students, and by extension Catholics, as a fifth column within the state, but that argument (and the crisis) was mollified through the intervention of high-ranking Catholics in the government and military. The incident did affect Manchukuo, mostly by deflecting anything similar from taking place there. Catholic missionaries were very keen to avoid a repeat of this incident on their own soil.\n\n\nThe more important legal development came not from the state but from the Catholic Church itself. The 1936 encyclical letter Pluries instanterque, which formally advocated accepting the local explanation and understanding of Shinto ritual in Japan, opened the door to a new Church policy of accepting local religious customs and customs more generally. Of note is the fact that the letter itself was prompted in large part by the potential for the narrowly-averted crisis in Japan to repeat itself in the more complex political setting of Manchukuo. Moreover, as Canon law in this sense respects the idea of precedent, this letter opened the door for far more changes post war. (DuBois 2017; Minamiki 1985)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1940s were a period of Total War across the Japanese Empire. Social engineering programs and political institutions that were established with some degree of ideological enthusiasm or long-term vision were quickly scrapped in favor of military expediency. This includes the entire legal system, which remained in form, but was in fact bypassed for a system of rule by fiat.  Legal decisions and decrees were still issued but were largely cosmetic. A constitution was promised, but never delivered. Promulgation of new laws ground to a halt. (DuBois 2010)\n\n\nPolicy towards Christianity during the early 1940s consisted of tightening screws on existing regulations for active participation in nationalist events and performance of nationalist sentiment in schools (e.g., keeping a shrine and demanding morning reverence for the two emperors and goddess Amaterasu) but as the wartime situation worsened, the prevailing sentiment was simply to wait out the storm. (Fulton 1967; Han 2005; Wiest 1988)\n\n\nThe late 1940s was substantively different. Although no decrees formally restricting or abolishing Christianity were enacted by the Communists, the sense was that any policies enacted by them would be far more thorough and non-compliance would be more harshly viewed., but again this sentiment was in anticipation of policies that had not yet been enacted.\n\n\n \n\n### Section: Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\n\n\nHostility toward Christianity in 1950s Korean society cannot be understood simply as a manifestation of anti-religious sentiment or interreligious conflict. Rather, it emerged out of a complex historical context shaped by liberation, national division, and war, during which Christianity became deeply entangled in politics, society, and culture. In this period, Christianity played a central role in postwar recovery and humanitarian efforts but was also criticized for its association with foreign powers, monopolization of authority, and internal factionalism.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Korean War, Christian churches—particularly those led by northern refugees affiliated with the Presbyterian Church—took the lead in relief and reconstruction efforts. Through close partnerships with American missionaries and church networks, they secured significant amounts of aid and humanitarian resources. This positioned them as key power brokers in both the church and society. However, this monopolization of aid and leadership led to conflict with other Christian groups, especially those from the Koryŏ-sin (Ko-Shin) and Chosŏn Theological Seminary (KiJang) traditions. These groups were marginalized, often accused of heresy, and pushed out of mainstream denominational structures. As a result, Christianity came to be seen by the public not as a moral or spiritual community but as an exclusive and power-driven institution. Another source of criticism was the church’s close association with foreign powers, particularly the United States. American churches and missionaries supported Korea’s Christians with money, personnel, and material aid, but this also reinforced the image of Christianity as foreign, Western, and anti-communist. This perception contributed to a growing belief that Christianity was aligned with U.S. imperial interests and the anti-communist agenda of the Syngman Rhee government. For nationalist intellectuals and youth disillusioned by American influence, Christianity appeared complicit in foreign domination. Moreover, the collaboration between Christian leaders and the authoritarian regime under Syngman Rhee added to this negative perception. Church figures often supported Rhee’s anti-communist rhetoric and were publicly praised by the government. This blurred the lines between political and religious authority, further reinforcing the belief that the church was entangled with state power.\n\nDespite these criticisms, it would be inaccurate to dismiss the role of Christianity in Korean society during this period as entirely negative. Many missionaries and Korean Christian leaders engaged in genuine humanitarian work: caring for refugees, providing medical services, operating orphanages and widow shelters, and rebuilding war-torn communities. American churches led national campaigns to raise funds and send aid to Korea. These efforts not only alleviated suffering but also helped lay the foundations for modern social welfare and education systems in South Korea. In the long run, Christianity contributed to the internalization of democratic values, civic ethics, and the development of civil society in the postwar era. Christianity, by virtue of its visibility and influence, inevitably drew both praise and criticism. Its rise to prominence amid national trauma and reconstruction created tensions across social groups, generating a complex mixture of trust and hostility. However, this hostility was not born of blind rejection. It was a reflection of Christianity’s historical positioning—as a moral force, political actor, and cultural mediator—in a society undergoing radical transformation.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\nIn 1960s South Korea, Christianity—particularly Protestantism—faced growing public scrutiny and complex relationships with both state and society. These tensions did not stem from a single source but reflected the broader upheavals of a society transitioning from postwar recovery to rapid industrialization under military rule. Social hostility toward Christianity, while significant in certain sectors, coexisted with efforts by Christian communities to actively engage with Korean society and contribute to national development.\n\nOne major source of tension arose from the increasing political involvement of Christian leaders and organizations. Groups such as the Korean Christian Academy, the Christian Professors Association, and the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) became vocal in advocating for democracy, social justice, and human rights. These activities sometimes brought them into conflict with the military government, which viewed politically active religious groups with suspicion. Nevertheless, it is important to note that not all Christian organizations were oppositional; some denominations and prominent pastors, such as Han Kyung-jik, maintained cooperative relationships with the state and supported national stability during this turbulent period. \n\nCultural tensions also shaped perceptions of Christianity. Although the religion had gained substantial urban followings, especially among students and intellectuals, some segments of Korean society still viewed it as foreign or insufficiently rooted in traditional values. However, theologians such as Yoo Dong-sik attempted to reinterpret Christian theology in ways that resonated with Korean religious sensibilities. Yoo argued that the Gospel must be understood through categories familiar to Koreans, such as do (道) rather than logos, proposing that “an overly Westernized conceptual framework could obscure the essence of the Gospel in Korea.” Such theological developments contributed meaningfully to indigenizing Christianity.\n\nAt the same time, Christian institutions made notable efforts to serve Korean society in concrete and transformative ways. For example, the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative, led by Presbyterian surgeon Jang Gi-ryeo, provided affordable healthcare to low-income families based on Christian principles of equality and service. It was “a democratic, non-profit model” that emphasized inclusion regardless of social class, age, or pre-existing conditions. In the economic sphere, Christian leaders helped expand the Credit Union Movement, which promoted grassroots savings and mutual aid—especially among factory workers—in alignment with Catholic social teaching and Protestant ethics of stewardship.\n\nChristianity also played a prominent role in education. In Daejeon, for instance, over 70% of kindergarten students in 1961 were enrolled in Protestant-affiliated schools. Christian educators contributed to rebuilding and modernizing Korea’s postwar education system, emphasizing moral education, civic responsibility, and democratic values.\n\nIn sum, while Christianity in the 1960s encountered social skepticism—particularly regarding its political activism and perceived Western character—it also made commendable strides in contextual theology, community development, education, and healthcare. The period thus represents not simply one of confrontation, but of negotiation and integration, in which Christian institutions contributed constructively to Korea’s modernization, even as they navigated the challenges of authoritarianism and cultural tension.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nIn 1960s North Korea, Christianity existed in an environment of extreme social hostility and systematic suppression. The North Korean state, based on Juche ideology and committed to building a socialist, monolithic society, regarded organized religion as an existential threat to its ideological control. As a result, all religious activities, including Christianity, were either eradicated or driven underground.\n\nBy this time, the remnants of the once-thriving Protestant and Catholic communities had largely vanished from public life. According to historian Keum Jooseop, “Christianity in the 1960s survived in North Korea only in hidden and highly fragmented forms,” with only a small number of known state-sanctioned churches remaining in Pyongyang, likely for symbolic and diplomatic purposes. The Korean Christian Federation (KCF), founded in 1946, continued to function during this decade, but scholars widely agree that it operated under the close supervision of the Workers’ Party and served as a controlled religious organ rather than a genuinely autonomous religious body.\n\nThe social hostility toward Christianity was not limited to institutional suppression but extended to individuals and families. Christians were routinely labeled as hostile elements (gyohakbunja, 교학분자), were excluded from Party membership, and faced limitations in education, employment, and residence. Many were sent to rural labor camps, prisons, or subjected to public criticism sessions. As Kim Seong-tae explains, “Christian identity was tantamount to political treason, and survival required either secrecy or renunciation of faith”. Despite this climate of repression, there is evidence of persistent faith among so-called “remnant Christians.” These were individuals or families who maintained clandestine religious practices, often passing on the faith through oral transmission and household worship. Testimonies from defectors and underground missionary sources indicate that some believers continued to pray in secret, hide Bibles, and baptize children despite the risk of imprisonment or execution. While integration into North Korean society was virtually impossible for Christians due to ideological exclusion, the very persistence of faith under such circumstances speaks to a form of spiritual resistance and cultural memory.\n\nIn summary, the 1960s represented a period of near-total erasure of public Christianity in North Korea, marked by severe state hostility and ideological persecution. Yet, beneath this repression, small pockets of hidden believers remained, embodying a resilient—if marginalized—form of faith. Their survival would later form the foundation for reports of revival in the 1970s, as North Korea sought limited re-engagement with religious organizations abroad.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea: Repression of Anti-Yushin Christian Movements and the Church’s Efforts to Integrate with Society\n\nThe 1972 establishment of the Yushin Constitution by President Park Chung Hee marked the beginning of a de facto dictatorship in South Korea. As political oppression intensified across all sectors of society, Christianity—particularly its progressive factions—was thrust into direct confrontation with the state. These Christian actors did not merely react; they publicly declared that faith could not be separated from justice, freedom, and resistance to tyranny.\n\nThis conviction found expression in the 1973 \"Declaration of Korean Christians\" and the 1974 \"Theological Statement of Korean Christians.\" These documents articulated the idea that Christian faith necessitated a commitment to human dignity and justice, and denounced the violence and injustice perpetrated by state power. The government responded with arrests, surveillance, and harassment of the signatories and affiliated groups, such as the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), pastors trained at Hanshin Seminary, and leaders in the Urban Industrial Mission. Despite state repression, the progressive Christian movement forged a new theological paradigm known as Minjung Theology. Pioneered by figures like Suh Nam-dong, Ahn Byung-mu, and Kim Yong-bok, this theology centered on the lived realities of the oppressed and insisted that Christ was present in the suffering of the people.\n\nSocial hostility also manifested internally within the Christian community. Conservative factions denounced this socially engaged theology as a deviation from the gospel. They feared that Christian participation in politics would dilute the transcultural message of scripture. Consequently, doctrinal schisms intensified, leading to renewed conflict within major denominations such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Tonghap and Hapdong) and the Methodist Church. Controversies over women’s ordination, inculturation worship, and theological education became flashpoints in this struggle.\n\nNevertheless, in the face of both state and internal pressures, progressive Christians persisted in their integration efforts. The NCCK attempted interdenominational solidarity, while groups like the Korean Church Women United, the Urban Industrial Mission, and the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF) developed practical ministries aligned with justice and service. As one statement encapsulated the ethos of the time:\n\n“The church is not a safe haven from the world, but a community called into the world.”\n\n\nNorth Korea: Reorganization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and the Rise of Socialist Christianity\n\nWhile Christianity in the South was contesting dictatorship, in North Korea it was undergoing a transformation into a state-managed religious apparatus. The 1972 Socialist Constitution of North Korea formally declared freedom of religion, but with a significant caveat: this freedom was only protected \"as long as it does not disrupt social order\". This stipulation effectively subordinated all religious practice to the authority of the Workers’ Party.\n\nThe centerpiece of North Korea’s religious strategy was the reorganization of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF). Far from being an autonomous religious body, the KCF became a political tool to facilitate international diplomacy. Through efforts such as applying for membership in the World Council of Churches (WCC), the KCF sought to project an image of religious tolerance to the outside world. However, critics noted that this was merely a diplomatic ploy. As Kim Heung-soo argued, “The activities of the KCF have nothing to do with theological autonomy and merely serve to express state ideology in religious language.”\n\nInternally, the regime recast Christianity as compatible with Juche ideology. Core Christian principles such as \"love\" were reinterpreted as loyalty to the leader and sacrifice for the nation. Worship services were co-opted into political events, and all religious expression was subject to surveillance.\n\nThis tightly controlled integration meant that public Christianity existed only within state-defined parameters, while theological education, independent preaching, and free association were prohibited. Despite these restrictions, some sources suggest that underground churches persisted during the 1970s, indicating a residual spiritual yearning among the North Korean population. Official publications described Christianity not as a superstition that dulled the masses, but rather as an ethical system repurposed to serve socialist society.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntra-Christian Conflict in South Korea: The Heresy Controversy over Minjung Theology\n\nThe 1980s saw intense theological conflict within South Korean Christianity, centered around Minjung Theology. Emerging from the democratization struggle, Minjung Theology sought to understand God's presence among the oppressed masses and was closely aligned with the broader liberation theology movement. However, conservative evangelical circles in Korea condemned it as heretical, accusing it of diluting biblical authority and being influenced by Marxism.\n\nProminent megachurch pastors publicly denounced it, stating, “Minjung Theology romanticizes socialist revolution and distorts the essence of Christian faith.” In response, theologian Suh Nam-dong argued, “The Minjung are not merely a class—they are the very people to whom Jesus first drew near. The Gospel is realized in their midst.” The debate went beyond rhetoric, leading to real consequences such as pulpit dismissals, publication bans, and canceled speaking engagements.\n\nDespite this opposition, organizations like the Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development and the Korea Theological Study Institute worked to foster dialogue between differing theological camps and to reclaim the public role of the Gospel. The National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), while actively participating in democratization, also led efforts to foster theological reconciliation. In 1986, these efforts culminated in the “Declaration of Solidarity with the Minjung,” which stated, “The Gospel of the Kingdom of God is revealed fully when it is proclaimed among those who suffer.”\n\n\nIdeological Hostility in North Korea: Christianity as an Enemy of the State\n\nIn North Korea during the 1980s, Christianity continued to be treated not merely as a religious deviation but as a political threat to the regime. While the constitution nominally guaranteed freedom of religion, the regime’s ideological apparatus framed Christianity as a tool of American imperialism and labeled Christians as “reactionary spies.”\n\nAccording to History of Christianity in North Korea, “Christians are regarded as agents of U.S. imperialism, seeking to subvert the socialist state.” In one reported incident from 1983, a house church leader in North Pyongan Province was arrested during a secret worship service and publicly executed following a show trial. The World Alliance of Reformed Churches later issued a formal protest.\n\nDespite this harsh repression, North Korea attempted to create a more tolerant international image through the Korean Christian Federation (KCF). The KCF acted as a diplomatic front, establishing contact with the World Council of Churches (WCC) and portraying North Korea as a nation where religious freedom was respected. In 1988, the Bongsu Church in Pyongyang was re-opened—ostensibly for foreign visitors—and the KCF claimed, “Our Republic guarantees true religious freedom.”\n\nHowever, such moves were largely performative, designed to appeal to international observers. Real integration or religious freedom remained absent, as Christianity continued to be treated as a systemic threat to the regime.\n\n\nAnti-Christian Secularism and the Recovery of Public Witness in South Korea\n\nIn the late 1980s, particularly after the June Democratic Uprising of 1987, Korean civil society began to mature, and with it came a wave of criticism toward the Church. Intellectuals and activists, disillusioned with the Church’s past complicity with the authoritarian regime, began to question its moral authority. Accusations such as “The Church has sold out to power and privilege” gained traction in public discourse, especially in universities.\n\nThe first issue of The Word (Malssŭm) magazine in 1987 editorialized, “The Church has lost its prophetic voice and colluded with the powers that be. It must now reflect on its silence before the suffering of the people.” As distrust grew, some students withdrew from Christian groups and rejected religious identity altogether.\n\nIn response, efforts to reintegrate the Church into public trust emerged. Movements like the Christian Social Responsibility Campaign, YMCA, YWCA, and the Urban Industrial Mission took proactive steps to rebuild the Church’s credibility. These groups partnered with laborers, farmers, and marginalized populations to embody the Gospel through social engagement. The Urban Industrial Mission notably emphasized, “The will of God must be realized in the workplace,” and its pastors led worship in worker dormitories and joined labor strikes, redefining what public Christian witness could mean.\n\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, South Korean Christianity encountered a complex landscape of civic attitudes shaped by cultural shifts, political democratization, and mounting social tensions. For the first time since the ideological hostility of the Cold War, the decade witnessed a visible resurgence of anti-Christian sentiment—not from state repression, but from segments of civil society, university campuses, and the cultural sphere. This civic hostility was not unidirectional, however. Parallel to it were vibrant efforts to integrate Christianity into a rapidly diversifying and democratizing public sphere.\n\nHostility toward Christianity in the 1990s often stemmed from its perceived entanglement with political conservatism and institutional authority. With democratization accelerating after 1987, sectors of the younger generation—particularly in universities—began to view major Protestant denominations as morally compromised by their historical collusion with authoritarian regimes. On campuses such as Seoul National University and Korea University, anti-Christian sentiments were expressed in public debates, graffiti, and even symbolic protests against campus ministries. Christian student groups such as the Korean Christian Student Federation (KSCF) and university chapters of the Christian Council of Korea often found themselves navigating a hostile cultural climate, where faith-based identity was stigmatized as reactionary or anti-progressive.\n\nInter-religious tensions also contributed to civic hostility. As new religious movements (NRMs) such as JMS, Shincheonji, and the Unification Church gained media attention for scandals and controversial practices, the broader Christian community was often conflated with these fringe groups in public discourse. The 1992 apocalyptic prediction by Lee Jang-rim's Dami Mission, which falsely prophesied the rapture, led to public ridicule and widespread suspicion toward evangelical Christianity. The line between “orthodox” Christianity and cult-like sects was blurred in media coverage, fueling a wave of skepticism and mockery against Christian expressions broadly.\n\nIntra-Christian conflicts also intensified. The emergence of the New Apostolic Reformation and other charismatic movements sparked internal denunciations, with some mainline churches accusing such groups of heresy and causing disorder. Theologically, the divide between evangelical conservatism, progressive minjung theology, and liberal Protestantism deepened, producing hostile pamphleteering, protests, and institutional schisms. These conflicts, though internal, spilled into the public sphere, undermining the church's moral unity and further inviting civic criticism.\n\nHowever, this period was not defined solely by hostility. Significant efforts were made by Christian organizations and leaders to bridge divisions and re-establish a positive role for Christianity in civil society. The Christian Ethics Movement of Korea and the Catholic Justice and Peace Committee engaged in advocacy on behalf of laborers, the urban poor, and human rights victims, often working in collaboration with secular NGOs and interfaith networks. The YWCA and YMCA, though Christian in origin, emphasized gender justice, environmental stewardship, and civic education, helping rehabilitate the public image of Christianity as a socially responsible force.\n\nEfforts to integrate Christians into social institutions also took shape in the education sector and media. Christian-themed literature, theater, and film explored themes of redemption, social justice, and historical memory. Prominent Christians such as novelist Lee Mun-yeol, despite controversies, participated in public discourse on ethics and national identity. Moreover, the expansion of Christian colleges and universities such as Handong Global University represented attempts to harmonize faith and public service, forming leaders for a globalizing Korea.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1990s in South Korea were marked by a dual movement: on one hand, an intensification of civic hostility toward Christianity fueled by ideological, generational, and religious factors; on the other hand, sincere efforts by Christian individuals and institutions to re-engage society through service, reflection, and reform. This tension would shape the role of Christianity in the 21st century as both a contested and essential participant in Korean civil life.\n\n\n\nNo answer\n\n\n\n**Conflicts Between the Presbyterian Church and the Holy Church and True Jesus Church**\n\n長老教會與聖教會和真耶穌教會的衝突。\n\nDuring the Japanese colonial period, Taiwanese society did not exhibit significant hostility towards Christianity, and the anti-Christian movement in China did not directly impact Taiwan. However, the arrival of the Holy Church and True Jesus Church in Taiwan in the 1920s led to conflicts with the Presbyterian Church. The most sensitive issue, aside from doctrinal differences, was the \"sheep stealing\" problem. Lai Ren-sheng, who once converted from the Presbyterian Church to the Holy Church, criticized the True Jesus Church and the Holy Church. He identified three common issues with these two churches: 1. Evangelizing to existing believers, causing confusion in their faith; 2. Re-baptizing those who were already believers; 3. Emphasizing \"divine healing\" as a condition for salvation. All three issues pointed to \"sheep stealing.\" Lai Ren-sheng also criticized the internal splits within the two denominations from the perspective of church unity. He criticized the True Jesus Church for splitting into factions such as \"Shin'yaso Kyokai\" and \"Makoto Yasokureja,\" which were hostile to each other. He also criticized the Holy Church for splitting into the \"Bishop faction\" supporting Chuta Nakata and the \"Committee faction\" supporting Shuji Kurata, particularly condemning Chuta Nakata as an extremist who supported nationalism and made false predictions about the second coming of Jesus. Lai Ren-sheng believed that denominations should cooperate and coexist but also asserted that the Presbyterian Church was the most stable and peaceful denomination (Lai Ren-sheng, October 1934: 3-4; November 1934: 5-6).\n\n日治時代的臺灣社會對基督教並無明顯敵意，中國的非基運動也無直接衝擊臺灣。然而，1920年代聖教會和真耶穌教會的入台，卻與長老教會發生衝突，除了教義方面，最敏感的莫過於「搶羊」。曾一度從長老教會轉信聖教會的賴仁聲曾對真耶穌教會、聖教會甚至發出批評，並指出這兩個教會有三項共同問題：1. 向已是信徒者傳教，混亂他人信仰；2.為已信者重新洗禮；3.重視「神聖醫治」，並視為得到救恩的條件。三項問題均指向「搶羊」。賴仁聲同時從教會合一的角度抨擊兩個教派的內部分裂問題。他批評真耶穌教會在台分出「シインヤソキヤウクヮイ」、「マコトヤソェクレヂヤ」等分支，且互相敵對；也批評聖教會分出支持中田重治的「監督派」以及支持車田秋次的「委員派」，尤其批評與中田重治為極端派，指其支持愛國主義，又錯誤預測耶穌將於某年某日再臨。賴仁聲認為教派之間應該合作、共存，但同時也主張長老教會是最為穩健、平和的宗派（賴仁聲 1934.10：3-4；賴仁聲 1934.11：5-6）。\n\nCompared to the Holy Church, the Presbyterian Church's criticism of the True Jesus Church was more severe. In the early years of the True Jesus Church in Taiwan, the \"Taiwan Church News\" published several critical articles in 1926, 1927, and 1929, such as \"My View on the True Jesus Church,\" \"Barnabas Chang Deceives People,\" \"Barnabas Chang's Methods,\" and \"Wang Jianxian,\" pointing out the doctrinal errors of the church and its leader, Barnabas Chang. These articles included personal attacks, accusing them of cheating people out of money and using witchcraft to harm others (Wu Xueming 2012: 119-120). These articles showed that the Presbyterian Church took the \"sheep stealing\" issue of the True Jesus Church very seriously.\n\n相較於聖教會，長老教會對真耶穌教會的抨擊更為嚴厲，在真耶穌教會入台初期，1926、1927、1929年的《臺灣教會報》更曾刊登數篇文章如〈真耶穌教的我見〉、〈張巴拿巴迷惑人〉、〈張巴拿巴的手段〉、〈王見現〉予以批判，指出該會和領袖張巴拿巴所傳教義錯誤，也涉及人身攻擊，包括騙人錢財、以巫術害人（吳學明2012：119-120）。前述文章顯示長老教會嚴正看待真耶穌教會「搶羊」問題。\n\nOn the other hand, figures like Huang Chengcong from the True Jesus Church criticized the Presbyterian Church for valuing those with power or wealth and trying to please the British. They also criticized the Presbyterian Church for \"resisting the true way\" and lacking the Holy Spirit, thereby justifying their evangelization efforts among Presbyterian Church members and encouraging conversion (Huang Elisha 1956: 33-35).\n\n而真耶穌教會方，如黃呈聰則批評長老教會內部看重有權勢或財富者、討英國人歡喜，並從教義層面指其「抗拒真道」、沒有聖靈，因此合理化其向長老教會信徒傳教並望改宗的踐行（黃以利沙1956：33-35）。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**(1) Repatriation of Missionaries**\n\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government tightened its control over foreigners. In 1939, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued Directive No. 6, \"Regarding the Entry, Stay, and Departure of Foreigners.\" The Taiwan Governor-General's Office promptly announced this directive through Official Ordinance No. 50. The directive required that foreigners traveling or staying in various parts of Japan must report to the local police authorities within the specified time frame. In August 1939, after the German invasion of Poland ignited war in Europe, and in September 1940, after Japan formed a military alliance with Germany and Italy, the Japanese government issued a series of decrees to repatriate missionaries and reorganize theological schools.\n\n（1）宣教師的遣返\n\n中日戰爭爆發後，日本政府對外國人的管制趨於嚴格，1939年內務省公布省令第6號〈外国人ノ入国、滞在及退去ニ関スル件〉，臺灣總督府隨即以府令第50號公布該省令，內容係要求外國人在日本各地旅行、宿泊都必須在規定時間內向當地的警察機關報備。1939年8月，德軍入侵波蘭，歐洲燃起戰火，1940年9月與德、義合組軸心國軍事同盟，日本政府頒佈一連串的法令遣返宣教師以及神學校改組。\n\n\nIn December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, triggering the Pacific War and declaring war on the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia. The Japanese cabinet immediately revised and promulgated Ministry of Home Affairs Directive No. 32, \"Regarding the Entry, Stay, and Departure of Foreigners,\" and the \"Guidelines for the Treatment of Enemy Nationals.\" The Taiwan Governor-General's Office promptly announced these directives through Official Ordinance No. 153. These directives required all foreign nationals residing in fortress areas and around military bases to leave. Clergy from neutral countries, such as Spain, were given more lenient treatment. However, missionaries from enemy countries were subjected to harsh measures, including forced detention or expulsion. Many British and American missionaries still in Japan at the time were placed under house arrest or forcibly detained.\n\n1941年12月，日本攻擊珍珠港，太平洋戰爭爆發，日本向英、美、加與澳洲宣戰，內閣立刻修正公布內務省令第32號〈外国人ノ入国、滞在及退去ニ関スル件〉及〈敵国人取扱措置要領〉，臺灣總督府隨即以府令153號公布該省令。其內容規定所有居住在要塞地區與軍事基地周圍的外籍人士都必須離開，對西班牙等中立國的神職人員則較寬鬆。然而，對於敵國的宣教師則施以鐵腕，予以強制拘禁或命令驅逐。當時仍在日本本土的英、美宣教師多人被軟禁或強制拘留。\n\nFollowing this, the British Church received numerous reports of missionaries being expelled from various regions and issued notices to its mission districts, but the situation was already beyond their control. With Japan escalating the war, the global situation changed drastically within three months. British mission organizations across the Far East faced significant challenges, especially in South China and Malaysia. As previously mentioned, all missionaries in Taiwan had left by the end of 1940. They left behind detailed contingency plans, thereby avoiding many unpredictable dangers.\n\n緊接著，英國教會陸續接到各地宣教師被驅逐的消息，乃發信通知各個宣教區，但情勢已非掌控之中。隨著日本挑起戰爭，3個月內世界局勢丕變，英國在遠東各地的宣教機構都面臨接棒的問題，尤其是華南與馬來西亞等地最嚴峻。如前所述，臺灣的宣教師在1940年底即全數離開，不但留下周詳的配置計畫，也避免許多不可預測的危險。\n\n\n**(2) Training Sessions for Missionaries**\n\n\nFrom March 26 to April 1, 1943, the Education Bureau of the Governor-General's Office held the \"Training Sessions for Core Teachers\" at the National Spirit Training Center in Dazhi under the name of the \"Taiwan Christian Service Group.\" The first session had 47 participants, while the second and third sessions, held on June 10 and 24 respectively, each had 57 participants and lasted for a week.\n\n（2）傳教師鍊成會\n\n1943年3月26日至4月1日，總督府文教局以「臺灣基督教奉公團」名義，於大直國民精神研修所召開「中堅教師鍊成會」，第一回共47人；第二、三回分別於6月10、24日舉行，各回57人，為期一週。\n\n\nThe training sessions emphasized \"ideological transformation\" for clergy, with the goal of instilling the principles of Shinto and national spirit. Each session began at 9 a.m. on the first morning, with participants gathering at Meiji Bridge in Taipei (now around Zhongshan Bridge) and then visiting the Taiwan Shrine. The opening ceremony was held in front of the Amaterasu Omikami. The instructor, Nakanishi Asahi, an authority on Japanese Shinto who was well-versed in the Bible, emphasized that the Japanese Emperor was a \"living god,\" equating his divinity to that of Jesus Christ as an incarnation of God. His teachings forcefully interpreted Christian doctrines. The practical training focused on \"rigorous practice\" to understand the \"Japanese spirit\" and the \"true essence of the national body.\" This included cold-water immersion in the early morning, known as \"misogi,\" followed by meditation, recitation of Shinto prayers (norito), meetings, group discussions, self-reflection, and bonfire ceremonies (kagaribi), as well as writing and singing poems.\n\n教師鍊成會強調對神職人員的「思想改造」，目的在於灌輸神道宗旨和國民精神。鍊成會第二、三回分別從6月10、24日開始，時間長達一週，各有57人參加。每回鍊成會首日上午九時，成員均集合於臺北的明治橋（今中山橋一帶），接著參拜臺灣神社，在「天照大神之御前」舉行開會式。指導官中西旭*為日本神道權威，他熟稔聖經，強調日本天皇為「現人神」，神格宛如耶穌基督，乃是現實的神明「道成肉身」，授課內容穿鑿附會基督教教義。術科方面以「苦鍊修行」為主，體會「日本精神」與「國體本義」，清晨浸冷水，是為「禊」（みそぎ），接著靜坐，念神道之祝詞（のりと），尚有開會、分班討論、自我檢討、篝火（かがりび）儀式等，還要撰寫詩詞謳歌。\n\n\nMost missionaries strongly resisted this forced \"brainwashing session,\" viewing it as \"the most distressing brainwashing event encountered during the war.\" Some expressed that \"it was a 'brainwashing session' completely contrary to Christian beliefs, and not being able to refuse at the time remains a lifelong regret, deeply feeling unworthy before the Lord.\" Only a few missionaries managed to escape using excuses of illness or other reasons.\n\n絕大多數的傳教師非常排斥這種強迫式的「洗腦會」，認為「此鍊成會乃是在戰時我們所遇到的最痛心之洗腦事件。」也有人表示：「這是一種完全違背基督教信仰的『洗腦會』，當時未能拒絕，至今每次回憶至此，深感愧對上主，成為終身憾事。」僅有少數傳教師藉口身體病痛或其他理由而得以脫身。\n\nConsidering the content of the training sessions, there was undoubtedly a significant conflict with Christian beliefs. However, through the Education Bureau, the Governor-General's Office conducted comprehensive spiritual indoctrination under the guise of the \"Christian Service Group,\" leaving individual clergy with little room to object. The speakers were polite and courteous, not forcing the participants to worship Shinto, but attempting to merge religious doctrines by emphasizing that \"Christianity and Shinto do not conflict; the concept of God in Shinto is also a Trinity. The greatest God is called 'Tenchu Omikami,' whom the Japanese do not worship but leave an empty seat for in the center. This God is the 'Yahweh' of Christianity; 'Amaterasu Omikami' came to earth as a human and bestowed the Japanese imperial lineage, and there is another God equivalent to the 'Holy Spirit' in Christianity.\" This arbitrary misinterpretation was difficult for Taiwanese Christians to accept.\n\n從鍊成會的項目觀之，無疑的大大抵觸基督教信仰，但總督府透過文教局，以「基督教奉公團」的名義進行全面的精神教化，個別神職人員的確很難有置喙的餘地。鍊成會的講者斯文、有禮、客氣，不強迫學員敬拜神道，但企圖將宗教的義理加以揉合，強調「基督教和神道並不衝突，神道的神觀也是三位一體的神；最大的神叫做『天中御主神』，這位神，日本人並不敬拜祂，只是留著祂的空位在中間，這位神就是基督教所稱的『耶和華』；而『天照大神』是來到世上成為人，傳賜日本皇統的神，另外尚有一位神，是等於基督教所說的『聖靈』。」此一任意曲解，臺灣基督徒難以接受。\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial hostility towards Christians was very real, but not necessarily anti-Christian as much as an amalgam of unfocused anti-foreignism, which also came to include those who associated with foreigners. Missionaries reported a constant drumbeat of low-level hostility from all quarters, being refused a ride in wagon carts, landlords being unwilling to rent, etc. It is hard to know how much of this is attributable to the behavior of the Christians, especially the Protestants, who prized the tactic of street corner preaching. The depiction as simple anti-foreignism does ring true, given that people didn’t seem to distinguish between types or nationalities of foreigners. Fears of a Russian invasion during the 1880s prompted rumors of a massacre of all foreigners (reported across missionary sources), supposedly to be sanctioned by the emperor. (Ross 1903)\n\n\nChinese Christians were targeted, both as a matter of principle, and because their refusal to participate in village rites and village activities such as temple building cast them as a divisive presence withing the community. Equally so for individual families, which violently turned against members who converted. \n\n\nThis sentiment was often led by individual scholars or officials, but in the end, it was the response of the Boxers that brought it to a mass movement. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe period started with the Boxers, which is a fairly clear indication of social hostility. However, it is worth qualifying that despite their anti-Christian/anti-foreign rhetoric, there were many motivations behind actual violence. There are numerous reports of people using the occasion to settle grudges against neighbors and employers. One of a late-Qing coal mine being destroyed by Boxers sounds like a typical case of luddite anti-technology violence, except for the fact that the perpetrators were themselves former miners, most likely motivated by a grudge against a former employer. I suspect that this sort of occurrence was behind a great deal of violence that on the surface looks like straightforward anti-Christianity.\n\n\nWith the suppression of the Boxers, social hostility no doubt remained, but it was no longer as easily expressed, especially through violence. There are occasional cases of former Boxers attacking or being mobilized to attack Christians, but in the latter case, the impetus came from a disaffected local official who used them as his personal goon squad. \n\n\nOn the contrary, the growth of Christian numbers and the Protestant “Manchurian revival” attest to a much greater acceptance, or at least to the new acceptability of expressing support in public. (DuBois 2017) This support extended beyond the religion itself to greater willingness to make use of allied institutions such as pharmacies and schools.\n\n\nAs with officials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous decade, social hostility was muted in this decade. Reports of official hostility were rare, as were cases of individuated violence towards Christians. Local officials continued to either publicly support the missions (making appearances or offering police protection for activities, etc.) or simply treat them with neglect. There was one report of a local officials mobilizing former Boxers to attack a Catholic village, but such instances were rare. My impression is that the higher up the chain of officialdom, the friendlier the reception. Besides not wanting to antagonize the foreign powers, the medical mission, especially of the Protestants, had been instrumental in combatting the outbreak of pneumonic plague that had run through Manchuria in 1910-1912. (DuBois 2014; Wu 1959)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking specifically about the Manchukuo period, the beginning of the decade saw Japan actively courting the foreign powers in an attempt to raise international support. The unequivocal condemnation of the state by the League of Nations Lytton Commission (which was British-led) came as a genuine surprise to many, and prompted a radical change in attitude, resulting in the state’s increasing isolation and turn to extremism. \n\n\nThis would manifest as a desire to contain the missions, if not expel them. The problem was rarely stated as an ideological clash with Christianity, which the official ideology of the state did not oppose. Indeed, it promoted an ideal of ‘patriotic churches’ under the leadership of the Concordia Association (xiehe hui/kyōwa kai). The guiding myth of the state that its founding was a spontaneous expression by the people of Manchuria was replicated in the ideal that its component pieces would all be drawn to a new patriotic participation. (Chou 1996; Duara 2003) Thus, it was important that religious leaders be shown (in the press and elsewhere) as voluntarily seeking to serve that state as Christian (or other) leaders. It was not a matter of rejecting the religious identity as sublimating it to a corporatist vision. Indeed, the state projected itself as a protector of religion, in contrast to the forced atheism of the Soviet Union or (as they depicted it) Sun Yat-sen’s “communism.” (DuBois 2017; Wiest 1988)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do not see any social hostility from the Chinese population either before or after the defeat of Japan. If anything, my sense is that the Christians (both missionary and Chinese) rode out the storm as best they could. Both the Catholics who stayed and the Protestants who returned were met with gratitude for being wartime allies, and for remaining friends during the worst of the occupation. There was however strong and universal agreement that the era of mission was definitively over. Neither missionaries nor the local church had any doubt on this question. \n\n\nThe hostility that was evident was imported with the Communist movement, and anticipated with their takeover. The final years of the decade saw Christians who had remained steadfast under the Japanese now apostatizing or keeping a distance from the missions in anticipation of what might happen after the widely anticipated Communist takeover. This was reported in both Catholic and Protestant sources.  Simply by virtue of having remained intact under the Manchukuo regime, the Christians were regarded as particularly suspect and de facto traitors by the Communists.\n\n\n \n\n### Section: Geopolitical dynamics and International Relationships\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, South Korea’s diplomatic, religious, and national identity evolved in dynamic and often turbulent ways, with Christianity playing a central role in shaping both domestic and international relationships. During this time, the country’s interactions with neighboring Asian-Pacific states, particularly North Korea, China, and Japan, and with Christian-majority nations such as the United States and Canada, were deeply influenced by religious, political, and ideological factors. Concurrently, expressions of nationalism and patriotism emerged in complex forms, often interwoven with Christian sentiment, public rituals, and anti-communist ideology.\n\nAfter liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, South Korea’s relationship with North Korea quickly devolved into ideological opposition that culminated in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The war marked a defining moment in the South’s assertion of identity, with Christianity positioned as a moral and spiritual force against atheistic communism. In the North, Christian churches were suppressed and believers persecuted; pastors were arrested, churches were closed, and many Christians fled to the South. Estimates suggest that two-thirds of the clergy in North Korea relocated southward, where they contributed to the growth of the Christian community. For missionaries and South Korean leaders alike, the war was not merely a military conflict but also a religious and civilizational struggle. The perceived clash between a Christian South and a communist North elevated the role of Christianity in state ideology and contributed to the consolidation of national unity under the banner of anti-communism. \n\nSouth Korea’s postwar stance toward Japan was largely shaped by historical resentment stemming from its colonial past. While diplomatic ties remained limited during this period, Christian institutions benefited from this estrangement. American and Canadian missionaries, in particular, were viewed as symbols of non-colonial benevolence in contrast to Japanese imperial oppression. This perception bolstered the legitimacy and influence of Christian missions in Korea, especially in rural and war-torn regions. During the war, Japan also functioned as a logistical and temporary humanitarian base for missionaries who were evacuated from the peninsula. Canadian and American missionaries stationed in Seoul and other cities fled to Japan in the early days of the conflict, only to return later to continue relief and evangelistic work.\n\nChina’s involvement in the Korean War further complicated South Korea’s regional relationships. Before the Chinese entry into the war in late 1950, some missionaries held out hope that Christian work might continue on the mainland. However, China’s intervention dashed such expectations, positioning the Chinese Communist regime as a clear adversary of South Korean Christianity. American and Canadian missionaries interpreted China’s actions not just as military aggression but as part of a broader communist threat to the Christian presence in Asia. As China became more closely aligned with North Korea, the ideological and theological divide in East Asia became more pronounced.\n\nSouth Korea’s relationship with the United States during this period was marked by deep military, political, and religious cooperation. American Protestant missionaries had laid the groundwork for Christianity in Korea since the late 19th century, establishing schools, hospitals, and churches that became pivotal institutions in Korean society. During the Korean War, this relationship deepened. The United States, through the United Nations Command, became South Korea’s primary military protector. Simultaneously, American churches, missionaries, and Christian organizations mobilized spiritual and material support for Korea, presenting the conflict as a defense of Christian civilization. The World Council of Churches formally condemned North Korea’s aggression and endorsed the UN military action, reinforcing the belief that the war was a moral as well as political battle. American missionaries often served as chaplains to Korean troops and civilians, helping to interpret the war through a Christian lens and providing essential humanitarian aid in the midst of destruction.\n\nCanada also maintained significant missionary and theological ties with Korea. Canadian missionaries had been active in northern Korea since the early 20th century, especially in Hamheung and the surrounding provinces. Following the division of Korea and the rise of communism in the North, Canadian missionaries hoped to return to their former mission fields, but the war and political changes made that impossible. Nevertheless, Canadian missionaries continued to support Korean Christians through their work in Seoul and southern regions, often ministering to northern refugees. Figures such as Florence Murray played leading roles in wartime medical and relief work, while others maintained educational and theological ministries despite repeated evacuations. These missionaries saw in Korea not only a spiritual calling but also a strategic battleground in the fight against communism, echoing broader Cold War sentiments prevalent in Western churches.\n\nExpressions of nationalism and patriotism during this era were deeply intertwined with Christian ideology. After liberation, the growth of Christian schools, hospitals, and churches was not only a matter of religious development but also a nationalistic endeavor. Mission schools like Ewha Girls’ School and Pai Chai Haktang became centers of civic awakening and national pride. Their curricula emphasized not just religious instruction but also liberal arts education, physical training, and public speaking, all intended to develop leaders for an independent Korean nation. Students participated in national ceremonies and were often involved in pro-independence movements. Christianity thus played a formative role in shaping a modern, educated, and politically conscious Korean identity.\n\nDuring the Korean War, nationalism was often expressed through religious symbols and rituals. Revival meetings, mass prayer gatherings, and public confessions of sin took on patriotic overtones. The church became both a refuge from war and a space for the cultivation of national spirit. Sermons often fused biblical narratives with themes of national suffering and redemption. Christian leaders emphasized that faith in Christ and loyalty to the nation were mutually reinforcing commitments. Public mourning for the war dead, prayers for national survival, and acts of charity were seen not only as Christian duties but as patriotic acts. In this context, the border between religious devotion and civic nationalism became increasingly blurred. The press and public discourse during this decade also reflected these sentiments. Newspapers and Christian publications described Korea as a “chosen nation” destined to resist communism and lead Asia in spiritual renewal. Anti-communist propaganda often relied on religious metaphors, and many church leaders were celebrated as national heroes. Christianity, especially Protestantism, was portrayed as a modernizing force capable of saving Korea from both its feudal past and the threat of totalitarianism. Even secular leaders like President Syngman Rhee, himself a devout Christian, invoked Christian rhetoric to frame national policy and foreign relations.\n\nIn summary, between 1945 and 1960, South Korea’s relationships with neighboring countries and Christian-majority nations were shaped not only by military and political factors but also by deep religious convictions. Christianity provided a framework through which Koreans interpreted war, occupation, independence, and national purpose. American and Canadian missionaries were more than religious figures; they were builders of civil society, allies in ideological warfare, and participants in Korea’s national drama. In return, Korean Christians embraced faith as both a spiritual refuge and a patriotic duty, contributing to the remarkable expansion of Christianity during a time of national trauma and transformation.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nIn the 1950s, Christianity in North Korea was not merely perceived as a religious practice but rather as a fundamental threat to the regime. This perception was deeply shaped by North Korea's diplomatic relations with neighboring countries and the broader international climate. Following liberation, North Korea, under the strong influence of the Soviet Union, quickly adopted a socialist system and embraced an atheistic ideology, which fundamentally rejected religion as antithetical to state ideology. Christianity, particularly, was seen as a symbol of Western civilization tied to the United States, which led North Korean authorities to brand it as an extension of imperialism and a tool of counterrevolution.\n\nThe relationship with the Soviet Union played a foundational role in shaping North Korea’s religious policies. As the North modeled its state apparatus on Stalinist socialism, religion was completely rejected and categorized as superstition. To ensure ideological conformity and social unity, churches were shut down and Christians were labeled as spies or reactionaries. Clergy and believers often ended up in labor camps or faced public execution. This ideological alignment with the Soviet model provided the justification for systemic religious persecution.\n\nNorth Korea's relations with China also significantly impacted its policy toward religion. During the Korean War, China's military intervention through the People's Volunteer Army was pivotal to North Korea's survival. This event led to closer strategic cooperation between the two nations. At the same time, China was suppressing Christianity as a remnant of bourgeois influence, especially during the lead-up to the Cultural Revolution. North Korea and China thus shared a common stance on religion and coordinated their efforts to eliminate Christianity, treating it as a hindrance to the construction of socialist ideology.\n\nHostility toward the United States further intensified the repression of Christianity. As North Korea's most prominent adversary, the U.S. was viewed not only as a military threat but also as a cultural and ideological one. Christianity, associated with American influence, was treated as a subversive force. Christians were accused of being collaborators with U.S. forces or South Korean intelligence, and religious activities were treated as acts of treason. Churches were closed, Bibles were burned, and many believers went underground. Persecution was not solely due to religious beliefs, but because Christianity was framed as a tool of American imperialism.\n\nIn relation to Japan, North Korea kept a close watch on Korean Christian communities among Zainichi Koreans. Many of these communities were centered around churches in Japan. However, the North saw Christian churches as a threat to ideological unity and attempted to control religious activity through pro-Pyongyang organizations like Chongryon. Religious organizations were sidelined in favor of ideological education through Korean schools, reflecting Pyongyang’s effort to neutralize Christianity’s influence among the diasporas.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea began diplomatic outreach to neutral or non-aligned countries in the late 1950s. In doing so, it treated international criticism of religious repression as an imperialist attack and an interference in domestic affairs. North Korea strategically ignored or downplayed religious freedom issues on the global stage while reinforcing domestic repression. The support of fellow socialist states enabled North Korea to justify its severe treatment of Christians as a necessary measure to protect its regime from ideological threats.\n\nIn sum, religious persecution in North Korea during the 1950s was not just a matter of internal policy but a calculated response to its international environment. Its relationships with the Soviet Union and China encouraged anti-religious campaigns, while antagonism toward the U.S. fueled its portrayal of Christianity as an enemy ideology. Even interactions with Japan and neutral states played a role in shaping how the North Korean regime isolated and suppressed Christianity. The repression of religion during this decade was deeply interwoven with North Korea’s broader foreign policy and survival strategy.\n\n\nTable 2.

The 1965 normalization of diplomatic relations through the Korea–Japan Basic Treaty triggered massive Christian backlash. Protestant and Catholic leaders—including Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and Kang Won-yong—publicly opposed the treaty, criticizing Japan’s lack of repentance and viewing the agreement as “a new form of economic colonialism.” This church-led protest marked the first major confrontation between Korean Christianity and the Park Chung Hee regime.\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThough militarily and ideologically hostile to the South, North Korea remained a spiritual concern for many churches. The division of Korea after 1945 and the Korean War (1950–1953) framed North Korea as a “mission field of suffering.” Evangelical Christians in the South engaged in balloon leaflet campaigns, underground missionary networks, and prayers for reunification. However, these spiritual actions often heightened inter-Korean tensions.\n\n\nVietnam\n\nKorean churches largely supported the Vietnam War, echoing anti-communist theology. Protestant denominations sent military chaplains and morally sanctioned South Korea’s intervention. Yet some theologians later criticized this as a betrayal of Christian pacifism.\n\n\nRelationships with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\n\nUnited States\n\nThe U.S.–Korea alliance was not only military but spiritual. American missionaries, especially Presbyterians and Methodists, had laid the groundwork for Protestant growth. In the 1960s, conservative American evangelicals—like Billy Graham—forged deep ties with Korean revivalists such as Cho Yong-gi and Kim Jun-gon, supporting massive evangelistic rallies. Meanwhile, U.S.-based churches and Congressmen like Donald Fraser pressured the Park regime on human rights abuses, especially after the Inhyukdang and Mincheonghakryeon cases.\n\n\nGermany\n\nWest Germany offered asylum and scholarship to many dissident theologians during Park’s authoritarian era. The Basel Mission and German churches became important allies for Korean ecumenical movements. German Christian NGOs also financially supported urban and labor missions, especially in Yeongdeungpo’s urban ministry, linking church resistance to global civil society.\n\n\nCanada and Others\n\nCanadian Presbyterians supported theological education and sent missionaries, especially to rural areas. Christian ties also expanded to Australia, the Philippines, and Taiwan through ecumenical networks like CCA (Christian Conference of Asia).\n\n\nState of Patriotism and Nationalism in the 1960s\n\n\nThe 1960s were a paradoxical period for Korean nationalism—marked by state-led developmental patriotism, anti-communist nationalism, and growing civil resistance, with Christianity playing both cooperative and oppositional roles.\n\n\nState-Orchestrated Nationalism\n\nThe Park Chung Hee regime promoted a highly disciplined, anti-communist nationalism that relied on slogans like “anti-communism is our national policy” and “national reconstruction.” Through public rituals, such as anti-communist rallies, patriotic commemorations, and military parades, the state fostered a collective identity rooted in Cold War binaries. Churches, especially conservative ones, were compelled or persuaded to cooperate in these rituals.\n\nPress: Government-controlled media praised the regime’s development agenda, and Christian newspapers that questioned it (e.g., Christian Thought) were monitored or censored.\n\nPublic Rituals: The Presidential Prayer Breakfast, launched with cooperation from Kim Jun-gon and supported by Billy Graham’s team, became a state-sponsored display of pious nationalism, aligning Christianity with national reconstruction.\n\nYouth and Civic Engagement: State-funded groups like the Korean Christian Anti-Communist League encouraged Christian youth to partake in patriotic education and military service as divine duty.\n\n\nChurch-Based Nationalism and Civil Dissent\n\nDespite widespread conformity, progressive Christian networks provided a platform for alternative national visions:\n\nThe opposition to the 1965 Japan treaty, Korean involvement in the Vietnam War, and Park’s 1969 constitutional amendment (for a third term) all witnessed resistance led by ecumenical and student groups.\n\nNationalism took on a theological dimension in the form of Minjung theology (from the late 1960s onward), advocating for “a people-centered, justice-oriented nation” in contrast to militarized nationalism.\n\nChristian professors and students—especially through Christian Academy, Urban Industrial Missions, and KSCF (Korean Student Christian Federation)—articulated alternative patriotic narratives rooted in justice, human rights, and reunification.\n\n\n\nKorea’s Diplomatic Relations with Asian-pacific Neighbors\n\n\nThe 1970s were marked by shifting diplomatic realignments in East and Southeast Asia, particularly as Cold War pressures intensified. These dynamics were reflected in how Christianity in Korea intersected with foreign policy—particularly with Japan, Vietnam, China, and North Korea.\n\nKorea’s relationship with Japan remained strained due to lingering colonial memories, many of which were deeply etched in the Korean Christian conscience. The Japanese colonial government’s imposition of Shinto shrine worship on Christians during the 1930s and 40s created long-lasting wounds, and even in the 1970s, these historical scars complicated efforts at religious reconciliation. As one historian notes, “Korean Christianity’s nationalism was in large part shaped by its resistance to Japanese assimilation policies, with pastors and believers martyred or imprisoned for rejecting shrine worship” . During the 1970s, no formal religious reconciliation occurred, but Korean churches periodically raised concerns about Japanese textbook revisions and war crime denial.\n\nIn contrast, Vietnam became a site of active Korean military and Christian involvement during the Vietnam War. South Korea, under President Park Chung Hee, dispatched over 300,000 troops between 1965 and 1973. Korean churches generally supported the war effort as a struggle against communism. According to the article Korea Churches’ Attitude toward the Vietnam war, “most Korean Protestant leaders justified participation in the Vietnam War as part of a sacred anti-communist mission” . The Presbyterian Church and the Korean Methodist Church even interpreted military service as an extension of evangelistic duty .\n\nYet this alignment with U.S. and South Vietnamese forces isolated Korean churches from the international Christian peace movement. Korean Protestant leaders defended their government’s role and rebuked foreign theologians for lacking understanding of communism’s threat .\n\nMeanwhile, China and North Korea remained diplomatically closed to South Korea, but were referenced in religious discourse. The ideological proximity of North Korea and China, particularly in their shared hostility toward Christianity, was repeatedly cited in Korean Protestant publications. One editorial warned that “China’s eradication of Christian churches shows the true face of Marxist atheism” .\n\nIn North Korea, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) made overtures such as applying for WCC membership, which were regarded as propaganda by the South. As Kim Heung-soo explains, the KCF’s gestures were part of “a diplomatic strategy to present the DPRK as a religiously tolerant nation,” though it was tightly state-controlled .\n\n\nKorea’s Relations with Major Christian-Majority Countries\n\n\nThe 1970s witnessed dynamic interactions between Korea and Christian-majority nations, especially the United States and West Germany.\n\nThe United States remained Korea’s closest ally both politically and religiously. Many Korean church leaders had been educated in American seminaries. Billy Graham’s 1973 crusade in Seoul drew over a million people and was hailed as a national religious event. As one newspaper reported, “This is not only a religious awakening, but a reaffirmation of our alliance with Christian civilization” .\n\nWest Germany, in contrast, supported Korea’s democratization through Christian civil society. The German Protestant Church (EKD) partnered with NCCK and progressive Korean churches. As Kim Jin-ho writes, “West German churches were among the few international actors who stood with Korea’s democratization movement when others remained silent” . However, such alliances deepened domestic theological rifts. Conservative churches leaned toward U.S.-style anti-communist theology, while progressives aligned with the WCC and CCA. Foreign relations thus fed into theological and political polarization within Korean Christianity.\n\n\nPatriotism and Nationalism\n\n\nThe 1970s were defined by state-led nationalism under Park Chung Hee’s Yushin regime. Nationalism was expressed in public rituals, press narratives, and ideological education—and churches were both collaborators and critics.\n\nKey to this agenda was anti-communism as civic religion. The National Education Charter was recited even in churches, and religious groups were expected to promote loyalty and national discipline. Park stated, “Religions must help the people cultivate spiritual power to serve the nation and fight against the Red tide” .\n\nConservative churches embraced this model. The Minjok Bogeumhwa Movement (Evangelization of the Nation) aimed to convert the Korean people by 1980 with government support. According to Kim Seong-han, “The movement fused evangelism with nationalism, presenting Christianity as the moral engine of Korea’s modernization and anti-communist struggle” .\n\nProgressive Christians, however, resisted. The NCCK’s 1974 declaration stated that “true faith cannot serve political idolatry,” opposing the merging of faith with state propaganda . This caused backlash from conservative denominations and the press, who saw it as undermining national unity.\n\n\n\nRelations with Neighboring Asian-Pacific Countries: Christianity in the Shadow of Diplomacy\n\nIn the 1980s, Korea’s diplomatic engagement with its regional neighbors was largely shaped by the Cold War order. Among these relationships, those with Japan and China were particularly significant from the standpoint of Christianity.\n\nWith Japan, formal diplomatic relations between the two countries had been normalized since 1965, yet societal resentment toward colonial-era atrocities remained deeply rooted. Despite this, Christian organizations in Japan, such as the Korean Christian Church in Japan (KCCJ), played an outsized role in fostering reconciliation and supporting Korean democratization movements. The KCCJ, consisting largely of Zainichi Korean Christians, hosted forums on human rights abuses in South Korea and provided platforms for exiled Korean pastors and intellectuals. These activities served as an informal bridge for transnational Christian solidarity at a time when official diplomatic relations remained politically cautious.\n\nChina’s case was more complex. Although South Korea and the People’s Republic of China did not establish formal diplomatic ties until 1992, informal religious exchanges emerged in the border regions, particularly among ethnic Korean Christians in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. These communities maintained historical Christian traditions dating back to early Protestant missions and served as a cultural reservoir of Christianity across the Sino-Korean frontier. Due to strict control of religion under the Chinese Communist Party, such Christian activities were limited in scale and typically disconnected from formal diplomacy, yet their significance lies in their quiet endurance and the symbolic imagination of pan-Korean Christian identity.\n\nWhile other Asia-Pacific countries such as the Philippines or Indonesia had Christian populations, their relevance to Korean Christianity in the 1980s remained minimal in terms of diplomatic or missionary engagement. Likewise, explicit state-level missionary diplomacy was limited during this period and will be more fully addressed in our forthcoming analysis of 1990s Christian foreign policy strategies.\n\n\nRelations with Christian-Majority Countries: Democratization and Diasporic Churches\n\nAmong Christian-majority countries, the United States and West Germany were most influential in shaping the religious and political landscape of 1980s Korean Christianity. In both cases, the impact was not primarily diplomatic but rather rooted in missionary legacy, ecumenical solidarity, and diaspora church activism.\n\nIn the United States, long-time mission partners such as the Presbyterian Church (PCUSA), the United Methodist Church, and the National Council of Churches became vocal critics of South Korea’s military dictatorship. They collaborated with Korean-American churches and civic organizations to raise awareness of political repression and support human rights. Korean Christian leaders such as Moon Ik-hwan and Kim Jae-jun leveraged these networks during their overseas visits, using them to amplify demands for democratization and religious freedom.\n\nIn West Germany, the presence of Korean labor migrants—especially nurses and miners—laid the foundation for a politically conscious diaspora church network. Leaders such as Rev. Jang Sung-hwan transformed Bible studies into spaces of political education, drawing parallels between biblical justice and Korean democratization. German missionaries like Dorothea Schweizer and Dietrich Richter actively supported these movements, often facing surveillance or expulsion for their involvement. Their activism illustrated how Christian solidarity could extend beyond theological dialogue into concrete resistance against authoritarianism.\n\nRelations with other Christian-majority nations such as Canada, Australia, or Latin American countries remained relatively limited in this decade. The Vatican’s engagement with Korean Catholicism also remained primarily ecclesiastical rather than diplomatic, although Catholic solidarity with democratization efforts was notably strong within Korea itself.\n\nAgain, more comprehensive missionary cooperation—especially institutionally driven mission strategies—emerged in the 1990s and will be analyzed separately in the next stage of this project.\n\n\nNationalism and Patriotic Culture in the 1980s: A Divided Christianity\n\nUnder the Chun Doo-hwan regime, the South Korean government aggressively promoted a form of state-centered nationalism that emphasized anti-communism, Confucian loyalty, and national development. Patriotism was embedded into the daily rhythms of life through public rituals, mandatory flag ceremonies, broadcast patriotic music, and school recitations of the National Education Charter. This nationalism was instrumental in justifying authoritarian rule and suppressing dissent, framed as threats to national unity.\n\nChristian responses to this nationalism were divided. Conservative churches—especially those aligned with large denominations and megachurches—often supported the regime, equating anti-communism with faithfulness to God and country. Prominent pastors such as Han Kyung-jik maintained cooperative relationships with the state, reinforcing the image of Protestantism as a guardian of the republic.\n\nIn contrast, progressive Christian movements—centered around minjung theology and the Korean Christian Student Federation (KSCF)—rejected this narrow nationalism. They articulated a theology of the oppressed that viewed the true nation not as the authoritarian state, but as the suffering people. Public statements, liturgies, and martyr commemorations often blurred the line between worship and protest. For these communities, nationalism was not inherently wrong—but it needed to be redeemed from state manipulation and returned to its ethical and prophetic roots.\n\nThus, nationalism in 1980s Korea cannot be understood apart from Christianity. It was not merely a secular ideology but a site of deep theological contestation. The split between accommodationist and resistance-oriented churches reveals how the Christian community itself became a microcosm of the nation’s fractured identity.\n\n\n\n\nRelations with Japan and China\n\n\nThroughout the 1990s, diplomatic tensions between South Korea and Japan intensified due to unresolved historical issues stemming from Japan’s colonial rule over Korea from 1910 to 1945. South Korean civil society responded with protests whenever the Japanese government approved controversial history textbooks. For instance, in the early 1990s and again in 2001, large-scale demonstrations erupted in Seoul against newly authorized Japanese history textbooks that were accused of minimizing or distorting atrocities committed during World War II. Public outrage centered particularly on Japan’s treatment of issues like “comfort women” and forced labor, demanding not only apologies but concrete reparative actions. In 1995, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued an official statement of apology regarding colonial rule and wartime aggression. However, many Koreans viewed the apology as insufficient due to the lack of follow-through or policy change.\n\nIn contrast, South Korea’s normalization of diplomatic relations with China in August 1992 marked a historic turning point. South Korea was the last major East Asian country to formalize ties with Beijing, and the move fundamentally shifted regional geopolitics. The two countries launched broad economic cooperation, with bilateral trade expanding from $6.4 billion in 1992 to over $145 billion by 2007. This rapid economic interdependence encouraged China to view its relationship with South Korea as more important than its historical alliance with North Korea. The shift also reflected a broader strategic transition in South Korean foreign policy from Cold War ideology to pragmatic economic diplomacy. The normalization of relations had religious and cultural implications as well. With increased Korean migration and business activity in China, Korean Christian missionaries and churches expanded their presence in major Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai. The South Korean government supported cultural diplomacy and overseas missions as part of its soft power strategy. Although religious activity in China remained restricted, Korean Christian networks played a growing role in cultural and spiritual exchanges between the two countries.\n\n\nRelations with the U.S. \n\n\nSince the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty, the United States has been South Korea’s principal military and diplomatic ally. During the 1990s, the alliance remained robust despite limited troop reductions and discussions about base relocation. U.S. forces continued to play a key role in the defense of the Korean Peninsula. The Clinton administration and South Korean government launched the Land Partnership Plan (LPP) to rationalize the footprint of U.S. military installations in Korea. Despite these changes, the majority of South Koreans continued to view the alliance as central to national security.\n\nAmerican missionaries, who had first arrived in the late 19th century, had already left a profound legacy in Korea through the establishment of hospitals, schools, and churches. Institutions such as Yonsei University and Ewha Womans University originated from missionary initiatives that integrated Christian ethics with modern education and healthcare. In the 1990s, as South Korean Protestantism reached its peak, Korea emerged as one of the world’s leading missionary-sending countries, second only to the United States. Korean missionaries were dispatched globally, including to China, Central Asia, and Africa, further reinforcing the transnational Christian network.\n\nThe influence of Christian values shaped both civic life and foreign policy discourse. Many conservative Protestant groups supported pro-American and anti-communist positions, viewing the U.S. not only as a military ally but also as a spiritual and moral partner. The perception of shared values between Korean Protestantism and American evangelicalism helped sustain strong diplomatic sentiment toward the U.S. during this decade.\n\n\nNationalism and Patriotic Sentiments\n\n\nNationalist sentiment surged in 1990s South Korea, especially through public discourse on unresolved historical injustices and territorial issues with Japan and China. Both the government and mass media actively promoted narratives of Korean ethnic unity and historical suffering. History textbooks and televised documentaries increasingly focused on the Japanese colonial period, independence movements, and comfort women, fostering collective memory and patriotic education. Symbolic national holidays such as Independence Movement Day (March 1) and Liberation Day (August 15) became focal points for public commemoration and national pride.\n\nOne of the most significant civic innovations of the late 1990s was the emergence of candlelight vigils as a peaceful form of mass protest. The earliest candlelight demonstrations began in 1992 in response to rising internet fees, but the most notable early example occurred in 2002, after a U.S. military vehicle killed two Korean schoolgirls in the Yangju incident. Thousands of South Koreans gathered peacefully in Gwanghwamun Square, holding candles to mourn the victims and demand justice. Although the protests were triggered by anger toward U.S. military impunity, they symbolized a larger desire for dignity, national autonomy, and democratic expression.\n\nCandlelight vigils soon became a hallmark of Korean civic identity. They were widely adopted in subsequent protests, such as the 2004 impeachment protests, the 2008 Mad Cow Disease demonstrations, and most prominently, the 2016–2017 candlelight revolution that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Thus, the late 1990s witnessed not only the intensification of patriotic sentiment, but also the birth of a new, nonviolent form of collective identity grounded in democratic participation.\n\n\n\n\n### (1) General International Diplomatic Relations: European War\n\n（1）一般國際外交關係：歐戰\n\n\n### (2) Diplomatic Relations of Christian Nations: Ecumenical Movement\n\n（2）基督教國家外交關係：普世合一運動\n\n\nThe Ecumenical Movement refers to the trend of church cooperation that began in the mid-19th century, especially evident in the 20th century. Its belief is that the churches of the world are essentially one and should work together to promote affairs, enhance church connections, and transcend denominational or traditional barriers, ultimately seeking \"the unity of humanity.\"\n\n\n普世合一運動（Ecumenical Movement）係指十九世紀中葉以降，尤其廿世紀所呈現的教會合作趨勢，其信念認為世上的教會本為一體，理應共同推動事務，促進教會連結，跨越教派或傳統的藩籬，最終謀求「人類的合一」。\n\n\nChristians place great importance on \"unity\" for a reason. Biblical doctrine holds that there is only one Jesus Christ, so all churches collectively are like Christ's singular \"bride.\" At the same time, the body of Jesus Christ is one, symbolizing that the fundamental meaning of the church lies in its reunification. The church, therefore, possesses both explicit and hidden characteristics, making the unity of all believers representative of the friendship between the church and the world.\n\n\n基督徒重視「合一」其來有自，因為聖經義理認為耶穌基督只有一位，所以全體教會就像是基督唯一的「新婦」；同時，耶穌基督的身體只有一個，象徵教會的根本意義在於歸復一體，教會因而兼有外顯與隱藏的特質，使得全體信徒的合一代表教會與世界的友誼。\n\n\nIn modern times, due to the active spread of the gospel by Christianity, various denominations gradually formed united, interdenominational missionary organizations. From a Christian perspective on the trends of the times: the 16th century was the era of the Reformation, the 17th century the era of denominationalism, the 18th century the era of immigrant dissemination, the 19th century the era of overseas missions, and the 20th century the era of the Ecumenical Movement.\n\n近代，由於基督教積極傳播福音，各個宗派漸漸成立聯合性、超越宗派的宣教組織。若以基督教的觀點來看時代思潮，十六世紀為宗教改革時代，十七世紀為宗派主義時代，十八世紀為移民傳播時代，十九世紀為海外宣教時代，廿世紀則為合一運動時代。\n\n\nIn 1910, the Edinburgh Conference was held, regarded as the starting point of the Ecumenical Movement. The missionary achievements in Taiwan were included in the conference's report, which explicitly stated, \"Everything is favorable for active progress in Taiwan. On such a small land, there are so few obstacles, and the conditions are so conducive to rapid and thorough evangelization.\" Later, the \"World Council of Churches\" (WCC), established in 1948, has long been the world's largest international Christian organization. By the early 21st century, it had over 200 denominations and organizations and 40 million member churches worldwide. Taiwan is notably an active member. Clearly, the Ecumenical Movement is indeed a significant issue in the history of modern Christian development.\n\n\n1910年，愛丁堡大會召開，被稱為普世合一運動的起點，臺灣的宣教成果名列大會的報告書內容中，明揭「一切都有利於在臺灣積極進取。在不大的土地上，障礙如此之少，而且條件如此有利於迅速而徹底的傳福音。」之後，1948年成立的「普世教會協會」（World Council of Churches, WCC，簡稱普世教協）長期以來都是世界最大的國際基督教組織，至廿一世紀初，全球有200多個宗派和團體、4000萬間成員教會。其中，臺灣更是甚為活躍的會員國。顯然的，合一運動實為近代基督教發展史的重要課題\n\n\n### (3) The Nationalist Situation in Our Society: Inland Extensionism\n\n（3）本國社會的民族主義狀況：內地延長主義\n\nIs there suppose to be something here???\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After 1895, Taiwan became a Japanese colony. However, it wasn't until 1919, following the revision of the judicial system, that the Governor-General of Taiwan demanded China transfer the judicial jurisdiction of Taiwan nationals across the strait to Taiwan. According to Law No. 25 of 1921, after preliminary trials by Japanese consulate officials stationed in Fujian, Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces in southern China, the judicial authority over Taiwanese criminals was transferred to the Taipei District Court under the Governor-General of Taiwan (Matsuhiro Kinya 2012: 260; Wang Shiqing 1961: 110).\n\n1895年以後，臺灣成為日本殖民地。不過，時至1919年，臺灣總督府順著司法制度的修訂，才要求中國把海峽對岸臺灣籍人民的司法裁判權歸屬臺灣。1921年依法律第二十五號規定，先經駐福建、廣東、雲南的中國南部各省的日本領事館官員預審裁判後，臺灣籍犯罪者的裁判權由臺灣總督府台北地方法院管轄（末光欣也2012：260；王世慶1961：110）。\n\n\nAt that time, Taiwan was politically and geographically associated with Korea and Manchuria (Northeast China). Among them, Taiwan and China had a special and deep relationship, with China becoming an important overseas development area for Taiwanese people. Japan targeted China for expansion and aggression, using medical services to enter China as a means of non-military expansion. Hence, Japan sent Taiwanese doctors to China to implement this goal of medical expansion. For example, between 1918 and 1924, the Governor-General's Office established Pok Oi Hospitals in Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and Shantou. These hospitals' staff comprised individuals from Japan, Taiwan, and China. The establishment of Pok Oi Hospitals posed a threat to the local medical ecosystem, leading to opposition from doctors within the British and American Christian medical systems (Chen Lihang 2012: 29).\n\n此外，當時臺灣與韓國、滿州（中國東北）置於同一政治地緣關係。其中以中國與臺灣人民具有特殊且深厚的關係，中國也成臺灣人重要的海外發展地；而日本當時以中國為擴張和侵略的目標，以醫療進入中國一度是日本進行非武力擴張的媒介，因此也派遣臺灣人醫師到中國落實其以醫療在中國進行擴張的目標。例如1918-1924年間總督府在福州、廣州、汕頭成立博愛會醫院，各地博愛會成員以日、台、中三方人士組成。博愛會醫院的成立為當地醫療生態造成威脅，英美基督教醫療體系的醫師因而發起反對聲浪（陳力航2012：29）。\n\nTo achieve the aforementioned goals, the Governor-General of Taiwan encouraged Taiwanese doctors to work in China by offering higher salaries. After the establishment of Pok Oi Hospitals across South China, many Taiwanese doctors took up positions there. Some Taiwanese doctors also set up their own practices in South China. Among the Taiwanese doctors practicing in China, some were Christians. Lee Mok (Lee Bing-wen), who graduated from Tainan Presbyterian Middle School, worked as an assistant at Gangshan Jian'an Hospital, established by Gao Zaizhu, son of Gao Zhang. His wife, Gao Xiuli, was the third daughter of Gao Zhang and sister of Gao Zaizhu. In 1925, Lee obtained his medical practice qualification and in 1929 went to Xiamen to manage Fuan Hospital. He also served as the school doctor for Xiamen Xuying Academy, Zhonghua Elementary School, and Quanmin New Daily Newspaper. Being a Christian, he actively participated in local church activities (Chen Lihang 2012: 40, 105).\n\n臺灣總督府基於前述目的，以提高薪資的方式鼓勵臺灣醫師到中國任職，博愛會在華南各地成立後，許多人即到此任職。但也有一些臺灣醫師在華南自行開業。前往中國行醫的臺灣醫師中，也有部分基督徒，李墨（李秉文）在台南長老教中學畢業後，在高長之子高再祝開設的岡山建安醫院擔任助手，其妻高秀理是高長三女，是高再祝之妹。1925年取得醫師開業資格，1929年西渡廈門經營扶安醫院，並在廈門旭瀛書院校醫、中華小學校校醫、全閩新日報社社醫。由於是基督徒，也積極參與當地教會活動（陳力航2012：40，105）。\n\n\nFrom the beginning of Japanese rule in Taiwan until the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japan maintained good relations with Western countries, primarily those with a Christian influence. Countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States had consulates in Taiwan, fostering close and harmonious interactions. Foreigners were also allowed to establish corporations and obtain land ownership. In September 1925, Shinichi Mori, the head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, announced in a reply to the British Consul in Tamsui, P.D. Butler, that foreigners in Taiwan could apply for corporate status under Japanese law, and that there were no current regulations prohibiting corporations from owning land. This followed the implementation of the \"Foreign Land Law\" (Law No. 42) in April of the same year.\n\n從開始領台至太平洋戰爭爆發前，日本與基督教為主的西方國家關係尚佳，英美等國均派任領事駐台，互動密切且融洽，外國人也可設立法人並取得土地所有權。1925年9月，臺灣總督府外事股長森新一在回覆駐淡水英國領事蒲脫勒（P.D. Bulter）時宣布，在臺灣之外國人得依照日本法律申請法人，且現行法規並無禁止法人擁有土地，同年4月以法律四十二號公布之「外國人土地法」將付諸實行。\n\n\nIn June 1923, the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, through Executive Order No. 54, announced the \"Regulations on Mutual Recognition of Ship Tonnage\" agreed upon by the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom. It stipulated that, after 1895, British ships holding tonnage measurement certificates issued by relevant British authorities would not need to measure their tonnage at Taiwan ports. The tonnage recorded on these certificates would be recognized as equivalent to that of Japanese ships. During the 1920s and 1930s, British Embassy personnel in Japan and Far East consuls visited Taiwan several times.\n\n1923年6月，臺灣總督府以府令五十四號公布日英兩國政府商訂之「關於船舶搭載量互認之規約」，謂1895年後，持有英國相關機關發給之船舶搭載量測量證明書之英國船舶，在臺灣各港口不需測量其搭載量，並承認其證明書記載之噸數與同樣之日本船舶噸數相同。1920年-1930年這段期間內，駐日的英國使館人員、遠東領事也數次訪台。\n\nAdditionally, during this period, various foreign warships docked at Taiwanese ports such as Keelung and Kaohsiung. For instance, in 1928, four British warships, including the HMS Bulrush, and the French Far East Fleet's Jules Michelet, visited Taiwan. In 1929, the Italian warship RM Magenta docked, and in 1930, the British warships HMS Colombo and HMS Marazion visited. These interactions indicate that the relationship between the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan and predominantly Christian Western countries was normal and positive at that time (Wang Shiqing 1961: 110-114).\n\n此外，這段期間也有各國軍艦停靠臺灣基隆和高雄等各港，例如1928年有英國布爾斯號等四艘軍艦、法國遠東艦隊朱爾密細愛勒號；1929年有義大利軍艦莫熱雅號；1930年有英國軍艦剛夫拉哇號和馬拉治翁號。由前述的往來關係可見，當時臺灣總督府與基督教為主的西方國家關係正常且良好（王世慶1961：110-114）。\n\n\nAfter Japan's takeover of Taiwan, there were two phases of armed resistance against Japanese rule: 1895-1902 and 1907-1915. By 1920, anti-Japanese actions had shifted towards non-violent resistance initiated by intellectuals, focusing on cultural enlightenment and the struggle for autonomy. From the 1910s, Taiwanese students studying in Japan and China began forming various organizations advocating for liberation. Most Taiwanese students in Tokyo were inclined towards the principle of national self-determination that emerged during World War I. Three major entities, *Taiwan Youth*, the \"Taiwan Parliament Petition Movement,\" and the \"Taiwan Cultural Association,\" became the primary forces advocating for self-determination.\n\n日本領台之後，臺灣曾有兩個階段的武裝抗日：1895-1902、1907-1915。1920年的抗日行動開始轉向由知識份子發起在文化啟蒙、爭取自治方面的非武力抵抗途徑。從1910年代起，在日本和中國的臺灣留學生就已相繼成立各種社團鼓吹解放，其中，東京大部分的臺灣留學生傾向一戰時期民族自決的路線，由其創設的《臺灣青年》、「臺灣議會設置請願運動」、「臺灣文化協會」三大系統是為自決派的主要力量。\n\n\nIn 1920, the leaders of the Tokyo Taiwan Youth Association made the abolition of the \"Law 63\" their central mission for national self-determination. In 1921, Lin Hsien-tang and others submitted a \"Petition for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament.\" However, the following year, the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan proposed extending the \"Law 63,\" which was passed by the Japanese Diet and continued to be enforced in Taiwan as \"Law No. 3.\" The petition for establishing a parliament was rejected. This result heightened the determination of young intellectuals to seek equality and autonomy. From 1921 to 1934, they submitted 15 petitions, all of which were unsuccessful.\n\n1920年，東京臺灣青年會諸幹部即把要求廢除「六三法」作為民族自決中心任務，並在1921年由林獻堂等人提出「臺灣議會設置請願申請書」，然而隔年臺灣總督府提出延長「六三法」的議案在日本國會通過，以「法律第三號」繼續在臺灣施行；而議會設置請願卻遭否決。此結果讓青年知識份子尋求平權、自治的決心更為高漲，從1921-1934提出15次的請願，但均未果。\n\nShi Ming divides the petition efforts into three periods:\n\n1. **Unified Front Era**: During this time, Taiwanese students in Tokyo, within Taiwan, and in China all supported the petitions in unity.\n\n2. **Era of Divided Fronts**: In 1927, the Taiwan Cultural Association and the Taiwan Youth Association in Japan were taken over by leftist factions advocating for socialist revolution. The right-wing of the Taiwan Cultural Association subsequently established the \"Taiwan Parliament Formation Alliance\" in 1923 and the \"Taiwan People's Party\" in 1927, adhering to the nationalist movement seeking autonomy.\n\n3. **Era of Decline**: There was internal conflict within the Taiwan People's Party between the leftist faction led by Chiang Wei-shui and the rightist faction led by Tsai Pei-huo.\n\n史明將請願分為三個時期：1.統一戰線時代。東京、島內、中國的臺灣留學生各派均為支持請願而求得一致；2. 戰線分裂時代。1927年島內臺灣文化協會和日本臺灣青年會皆由左派取得主導權，支持社會主義革命；臺灣文化協會的右派則另外先後在1923年成立「臺灣議會期成同盟會」，1927年成立「臺灣民眾黨」，固守尋求自治的民族運動路線；3. 沒落時代。臺灣民眾黨的蔣渭水派（左派）和蔡培火派（右派）對立。\n\n\nDespite the petitions being rejected, some Japanese politicians and scholars expressed support. In response to the political backlash from Taiwanese and their demand for political participation, the Governor-General's Office established the \"Taiwan Governor-General's Advisory Council\" in 1921. This council included nine Taiwanese members out of 25. However, the council was merely an advisory body providing opinions on bills and important matters, often under official guidance, which was significantly misaligned with the demands of the Taiwanese people (Shi Ming 2014: 468-510; Matsuhiro Kinya 2012: 256-260; Jian Houcong 2002: 608; Chou Wan-Yao 2011: 9-30).\n\n雖然請願運動被駁回，但日本有若干政治家、學者表達支持。此外，為因應臺灣人的政治反彈以及要求參政權的自治動向，總督府在1921年設置「臺灣總督府評議會」，允許於25名會員中有9名臺灣人參加。然而評議會在法案和重要事項方面只是陳述參考意見的諮詢機關，許多討論是在官方主導下完成，與臺灣人的訴求存在極大落差（史明2014：468-510；末光欣也2012：256-260；簡後聰2002：608；周婉窈2011：9-30）。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**(1) General International Diplomatic Relations**\n\n\nA. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident: In 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out. In response, the Japanese government sought to consolidate national power, launching a series of national policies such as the \"National Spiritual Mobilization Movement\" and the \"New Order Movement,\" based on social indoctrination. The Governor-General's religious policy evolved from initial \"indulgent tolerance,\" through mid-term \"systematic improvement,\" to \"religious control\" during the wartime period. As militarism rose, Japan's attitude towards Christian countries and Christians became increasingly hostile. Western religions in both Japan and Taiwan were introduced by foreigners, thus when the Japanese government formulated laws, they considered both diplomatic and religious aspects. \n\n\nDuring the expansion of the war in 1941, the Japanese government adopted a \"diplomacy first, religion second\" approach in handling the presence of foreigners. Spain, due to its neutral stance, saw its Dominican clergy not deported but still monitored, with restrictions on their residence and requirements to support the war effort and align with national policies. In Taiwan, most foreign Christian personnel from \"enemy countries\" such as Britain and the United States were expelled, forcing Taiwanese Christians to become self-reliant and autonomous.\n\n（1）一般國際外交關係\n\nA.盧溝橋事變：1937年，盧溝橋事變爆發，日本政府為集結國力，遂以社會教化為基礎，推展一系列的「國民精神總動員運動」、「新體制運動」等國策。總督府的宗教政策也從初期「放任溫存」、中期「制度整備」進入戰爭時期的「宗教統制」。軍國主義抬頭時，日本對基督教國家及基督徒的態度漸漸轉為敵對。日本國內與臺灣的西方宗教均係外籍人士引入，因此日本政府制訂法令時乃同時考量外交與宗教的層面。1941年戰事擴大之際，日本政府採取「先外交後宗教」的順序處理外籍人士的去留。其中，西班牙因保持中立，所屬的天主教道明會的神職人員未遭遣返，但仍被監視、限制住居，被要求協力戰爭、配合國策。在臺灣，屬於「敵國」英、美的外籍基督教人士絕大多數遭到驅逐出境，臺灣基督徒不得不自立自治。\n\n\n**(2) Diplomatic Relations with Christian Countries**\n\n\nThe term \"Manchuria\" refers to the Kwantung Leased Territory established in 1905 (later known as the Kwantung Bureau) and the territory of Manchukuo established in 1932, following the Mukden Incident in 1931. In other words, it encompasses the three northeastern provinces during the Qing Dynasty or the nine northeastern provinces in early Republican China. Due to colonial rule, Taiwan had connections with Manchuria, which is about 2,000 kilometers away. According to statistics, there were approximately 5,000 Taiwanese people in Manchuria, and the life stories of nearly one-fifth of them are gradually being uncovered, shedding light on this obscure piece of history.\n\n\n（2）基督教國家外交關係\n\n所謂「滿洲」係指1905 年成立的關東州（後稱關東廳）、1931 年九一八事變隔年（1932）成立的滿洲國之疆域。換言之，即清代的東三省或民初的東北九省。臺灣因殖民統治之故，乃與2,000 公里之遙的滿洲有所關聯。根據統計，在滿的臺人約有5,000，其中近五分之一的生命故事漸被知曉，使這段隱晦的歷史露出一線曙光。\n\nSome of the Taiwanese people who had experiences in Manchuria had church backgrounds. The development of Christianity in Manchuria was similar to that in Taiwan, with both being influenced by 19th-century overseas missions and initially facing the clash between Western culture and local traditions. In Manchuria, the Presbyterian Church was predominant. British missionary William C. Burns arrived in 1867, followed by the Irish Presbyterian Church in 1869, and the Free Church of Scotland in 1872. In 1891, these two missions merged to expand their work, establishing presbyteries and synods by 1907. By 1925, they had joined the National Assembly, and by 1941, the Manchurian Presbyterian Church had nearly 300 churches with over 30,000 believers, making up about half of the total Christian population in the region.\n\n曾有滿洲經驗的臺灣人，其中不少具有教會背景。而滿洲的基督教淵源和臺灣發展類似，時間接近，背景都是19 世紀的海外宣教，初期也都面臨西方文化與本地傳統的碰撞。滿洲以長老教會為主，1867 年英國宣教師賓惠廉（William C. Burns）的足跡抵達，1869 年愛爾蘭長老教會入滿，1872 年蘇格蘭自由教會繼之，1891 年兩差會合併開拓，1907 年陸續設立中會和大會，1925 年加入全國總會，到1941 年滿洲長老教會已近300 間，信徒三萬多人，約佔整體基督教之半。\n\nTaiwanese Christians who went to develop in Manchuria were mostly middle-class individuals, particularly in the medical field, as well as in business and academia. This phenomenon was related to colonial policy. At that time, Japan actively recruited professional and technical personnel to develop new territories, and Taiwanese people possessed a pioneering spirit. In Manchuria, they ranked just below the Japanese, above the Manchu, Han, Mongolians, and Koreans, and faced fewer restrictions than they did in Taiwan. Notably, despite their upward social mobility, Taiwanese Christians did not become arrogant or self-important. Instead, they practiced their faith and used their professional skills, especially medical knowledge, to help the local people. As a result, Taiwanese doctors gained a high reputation in Manchuria, earning Taiwan the nickname \"Island of Doctors\" and \"Great Immortals Island.\" This was in stark contrast to the Japanese colonizers, and it earned the respect and recognition of Manchurian society.\n\n赴滿洲發展的臺灣基督徒，大多是中產階級人士，尤其是醫學領域，還有實業、學術界人士，此一現象與殖民政策相關。是時，日本積極招募專業技術人員前往新天地發展，而臺人也甚具拓荒奮鬥之精神，在滿洲僅次日人，位階在滿、漢、蒙、朝鮮之上，受到的箝制比在臺島為少。可貴的是，臺灣基督徒雖有社會階層的上升流動，但不因此而驕矜，極少自視甚高，反而實踐信仰，用專業技術尤其醫學知識來幫助當地人，使得滿洲的臺灣醫師的聲譽極高，臺灣還因此被稱為醫師島、大仙島，受到滿洲社會的肯定，與日本殖民者形成鮮明對比。\n\nHowever, after the war, Taiwanese Christians with experience in Manchuria faced significant challenges. Their years of service were not recognized, and they faced the threat of being judged as \"traitors.\" Consequently, most people concealed this part of their past, and related information is sparse and difficult to find. Even those fortunate enough to return to their homeland encountered a hostile political environment. The stigma of being associated with \"Manchukuo\" was not politically acceptable. In summary, the unique temporal and spatial circumstances profoundly influenced the life stories of these Christians, leaving a deep imprint from their Manchurian experiences and the legacy of colonialism.\n\n然而，戰後有滿洲經驗的臺灣基督徒，非但年資不得列計，還要面對「漢奸」審判的威脅，故大多數人都隱藏這段過去，相關資料也零散難尋。縱使幸運回到故鄉，但等待他們的，卻是險惡的政治環境，因為「滿洲國」的烙印，並非政治正確的一端。要之，在特殊的時空處境，基督徒的滿洲經驗和殖民遺緒深刻影響他們的生命故事。\n\n\n**(3) Nationalist Conditions in Domestic Society**\n\n\nDuring the Japanese colonial period, the Governor-General's Office consistently employed discriminatory and unequal policies. However, it is undeniable that under their administration, Taiwan gradually transformed from a traditional society, achieving relative stability in its political, economic, cultural, and educational environments. From the mid-1930s, Taiwanese Christians experienced a series of revival movements in both the southern and northern regions due to the expansion of the church, accumulating many achievements and forward-looking momentum. This led to a significant increase in faith identity. Influenced by this, Christians generally adopted a proactive mindset, believing they had a responsibility towards the development of both the church and society. They sought to advance both and began to learn from the Japanese experience in church governance. As a result, the church's advocated goals of self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance were achieved earlier than expected due to the changing times. The pursuit of \"evangelizing for the nation\" and realizing the ideals of the Kingdom of Heaven took a significant leap forward.\n\n（3）本國社會的民族主義狀況\n\n日治時期，總督府的殖民統治一貫採取差別、歧視的手段，但不可否認的，臺灣在其治理下，漸次從俗民社會脫胎換骨，政治、經濟、文化及教育環境相對穩定。自1930年代中期，臺灣基督徒由於教勢的拓展，南、北都經歷一連串的奮興運動，累積許多成果與前瞻的動力，信仰認同獲得一定程度的提高。受此影響，基督徒普遍秉持積極進取的思想，認為自身對教會與社會的發展負有責任，應同時謀求教會與社會的「進步」，並開始吸取日人治理教會的經驗。其結果，教會所提倡的自養、自傳、自治三大目標，因時局的轉變而提前實現。「傳道報國」實踐天國理想的腳步，向前大步跨越。\n\n\nDuring this period, as international relations changed and tensions rose, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office implemented a series of social indoctrination movements. These aimed to increase the productivity of rural communities, improve hygiene, promote the use of the Japanese language, foster reverence for the gods and the emperor, and enhance living conditions. The social indoctrination measures promoted by the government were in line with Japan's national policies, organizing, utilizing, and controlling the people. Besides advocating for industrial and economic revitalization, these measures also had a strong spiritual and lifestyle improvement aspect.\n\n此一時期，臺灣總督府隨著國際關係改變，局勢漸趨緊張、進而實施一連串社會教化運動，以提高農村聚落經濟體的生產力、改進衛生，加強普及日語、敬神尊皇、生活改善為項目。官方推動的社會教化措施係配合日本總體國策，對人民進行編組、利用與支配，除提倡產業經濟振興之外，更呈現出濃厚的精神運動與生活改善的性質。 \n\n\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Taiwan launched the \"Kominka Movement\" to align with Japan's \"National Spiritual Mobilization Movement.\" This movement inherited the essence of social indoctrination, representing a series of \"imperial citizenization\" measures implemented by Japan in colonial Taiwan. The Kominka Movement continued the key points of social indoctrination, emphasizing the frequent use of the Japanese language, mandatory shrine worship, family worship of the \"Jingu Taima,\" and the promotion of the Japanese lifestyle. From 1940, it further encouraged the \"changing of names\" to reinforce the cultivation of the Japanese spirit. In education and culture, it banned Chinese language courses in schools, abolished Chinese columns in newspapers, prohibited traditional operas, reorganized temples, and improved the main halls of Taiwanese households to eliminate Han Chinese influences. Governor Kobayashi Seizo explicitly declared \"imperial citizenization, industrialization, and the establishment of a southern advance base\" as his three principles for governing Taiwan.\n\n1937年中日戰爭爆發，為配合日本本土「國民精神總動員運動」，臺灣展開「皇民化運動」，承接社會教化運動的內涵，可謂日本在殖民地臺灣所推行一連串「皇國臣民化」的措施。皇民化運動延續社會教化的要項，加強日語常用、強制參拜神社、家庭奉祀「神宮大麻」、推行日本生活樣式，1940年起更鼓勵「改姓名」，強化日本精神涵養。文教方面，禁止學校漢文課程、廢止報紙漢文欄、禁止傳統戲曲、實施寺廟整理、臺人家庭正廳改善等，企圖去除漢民族色彩。小林躋造總督亦明白揭櫫「皇民化、工業化、南進基地化」為其治臺三原則。 \n\n\nThe Kominka Movement impacted all levels of society, covering various aspects of colonial life. The Sino-Japanese War brought colonial Taiwan into a wartime regime alongside the mother country. To secure Taiwan's strategic position, the Governor-General's Office sought to assimilate Taiwanese people into true \"imperial subjects,\" instilling in them Japanese patriotism and a spirit of sacrifice. Clearly, the Kominka Movement had a profound impact on the daily lives of Taiwanese people, including Christians.\n\n皇民化運動幾乎影響社會各個階層，涵蓋面之大，觸及殖民地生活的大小細節， 而中日戰爭使殖民地臺灣隨著母國進入戰時體制，為扼守臺島重要戰略位置，總督府試圖同化臺人成為真正的「皇國臣民」，使臺人具有日本國民之愛國心和犧牲精神。 顯然的，皇民化對臺人的日常生活影響甚大，基督徒亦不例外。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy far the most important dynamic was the decline of the mediated power of the Qing to the growing but yet informal influence of foreign powers.  During the late 19th century, the Qing had brought the region under increasingly direct administration, but at the time it was still ruled as military commanderies, creating a relative power vacuum that was easily exploited by neighboring Russia and Japan, and to a far lesser extent by other powers who had an interest in Yingkou.\n\n\nInformal foreign influence coexisted with actual declining Chinese power for some decades, until the outbreak of war with Japan in 1894. This war revealed the complete ineptitude of China’s modernizing military and further destabilized the region with waves of deserting soldiers.\n\n\nThe result was that Japan would make the first land grab of the foreign powers in China, anticipating later war with Russia, and ushering in a new era of direct foreign enclave administration.\n\n\nIt should be noted that Japanese Catholics and the Catholic missionaries in Japan were supportive of this war effort. Japanese Catholics served with unusual valor in the military, and MEP priests blessed troops on the way to the front.\n\n\nChinese nationalism was present but inchoate, consisting largely of aimless antiforeignism and vague hope for reform.\n\n\n\n\nThe military defeat of the Qing, followed by the disaster of the Boxer uprising (and the need for foreign troops to help put it down) made clear the state of the power vacuum in the country, notably in Manchuria, where Russia and Japan fought for supremacy in 1904-5. \n\n\nNotably, although Russia was a Christian country, missionaries were anything but optimistic about what Russian victory would mean for the missions. Missionaries praised the orderly behavior of the Japanese side’s troops, and were more confident in the place of Christianity in a modern, Japanese run or administered Manchuria.\n\n\nThe rise and fall of the Boxers also ushered in a new era of common purpose among certain levels of the foreign community, at least in Manchuria.\n\n\nSomewhat ironically, as the Qing had now displayed its loss of de facto control over the region, it was during this period that Manchuria was finally brought under direct central control, with the three former commanderies now being made into provinces.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wars of the previous years, combined with the fall of the Qing had created a vacuum in the region that Japan was starting to fill. Both economically and culturally, Japan was still a minor influence of Manchuria’s life, but that role was growing, and notably it was the one most associated with progress. During these years, Japan’s interest in Dalian (Kanto) began to develop, and from there, to reach northward through the South Manchuria Railway, over which it maintained suzerainty that extended to a buffer region a few kilometers along the length of the track. This effectively gave Japan an exclusive development zone reaching from Dalian to Changchun, and Japanese developmental investment, especially through the railway itself, began in earnest. \n\n\nJapan had directly annexed Korea in 1910, marking it as a new form of expansionist power within the region. While this event did not itself prompt migration from Korea, the relative poverty of the North would increasingly do so. While Korean Protestants were particularly prominent the 1919 nationalist conflict with Japan, most overland migrants were motivated by poverty, rather than ideology. Christians were relatively few, and missions regarded the new arrivals as an opportunity.\n\n\nRussia had been effectively sidelined from the region after 1905, and this influence was removed entirely following the revolution of 1917. This event prompted a flood of refugees from across the Russian Empire, including not only ethnic Russians, but also Catholic Ukrainians and Poles. These refugees increased the population of Harbin and became a major feature of that city’s cultural and economic life, but unlike the Christian missions, did not interact significantly with the city as a religious force. (Bakich 2001; Carter 2002; Chernolutskaya 2001)\n\n\nWestern powers were largely on the sidelines, other than as observers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should be remembered is that until Japan’s 1931 invasion, and to some degree even thereafter, Japan was widely viewed by most foreigners and even many Chinese as the progressive force in the region. Only with the 1935 report of the Lytton Commission, which unequivocally stated that the Manchukuo state was a puppet of Japan, was this reputational coffin finally closed. From that point, Anglo-American sentiment would turn decisively against Japan and against the Manchukuo project. This would further foster a mutually hostile atmosphere for Protestant missions in the region. \n\n\nPatriotism is hard to gauge, because the creation of Manchukuo prompted an exodus of the most patriotic Chinese elements, including the relocation of Northeast University. (Wang 1988) There was little organized underground activity, as these elements preferred to regroup in areas under Chinese control, first behind the Great Wall, and later to the Southeast. Manchukuo did have its nationalist element, especially the ideologues who arrived from elsewhere in the Japanese Empire. (Duara 2003) The growing thought surveillance amongst intellectuals at the (new) Manchukuo Foundation University and the social engineering projects that picked up speed after the Lytton Report did have boosters, but the direction was less anti-Christian than an increasingly paranoiac mix of anti-Western, anti-Communist, and anti-Chinese. Towards the end of the decade, Protestants were particularly caught up in charges of anti-Japanese sentiment (but were not deported). Especially after the French surrender to the Nazis, the French Catholics were much better able to weather this storm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious political dynamic was the Pacific War, which cast the Anglo-American Protestants as enemies of Japan and subsequently as friends of China. Catholics, including American Maryknollers were somewhat better viewed, especially given that the Church itself had (through Pluries instanterque) now definitively cast itself as a non-political actor. (Wiest 1988)\n\n\nWartime Japan itself was not to my knowledge viewed by the Allies as an enemy of Christianity so much as an enemy of civilization. The association with the other Axis powers, and behavior of Japan in Southeast Asia further solidified this image. \n\n\nThe Christian nations of Europe viewed the Communist movement with trepidation, based less on experience than on experience with the Soviet Union. Any guarded optimism that remained at the close of the 1940s quickly dissipated in the first years after the actual takeover.\n\n\n \n\n### Section: Bibliography\n\n\nHaga, Kai Yin Allison.
