Initially, it started under the guise of a religious uprising but later evolved into a large-scale peasant revolt against the government's exploitation of forests and lands. During this time, the Tapani Church (the predecessor of the Yujing Church) experienced significant upheaval. Twenty-two local believers were arrested, with seven sentenced to death, twelve to life imprisonment, and only three released. The church was occupied by officials for several months, causing considerable disruption. Fortunately, the label of a \"religious uprising\" gradually faded, and the incident eventually came to an end.\n\n\n1915年，余清芳等人發起抗日運動，史稱西來庵事件（噍吧哖事件）。初期以宗教之名起事，但後來則演變成農民對政府山林園野收奪的大規模抗爭。當時，噍吧哖教會（玉井教會前身）曾歷經震盪，當地有22名信徒被捕，其中7人極刑、12人無期徒刑，僅3人獲釋，教堂亦被官方佔用數月，造成很大的困擾。幸而「宗教起義」之名已經淡化，事件也漸漸落幕。\n\n\n### Religious Investigation\n\n\n#### Post-Xilai An Incident Religious Investigation\n\n\nAfter the Xilai An Incident, the Governor-General's Office conducted three religious investigations between 1915 and 1918 to \"improve religious superstitions, identify conspiratorial groups, and maintain social order.\" In 1919, the project leader Marui Keijiro 丸井圭治郎, based on the investigation reports from the six departments and temple ledgers, proposed the \"Taiwan Religious Investigation Report (Volume One).\"\n\n\n**(2) Religious Investigation**\n\n\nAfter the Xilai An Incident, the Governor-General's Office conducted three religious investigations from 1915 to 1918 to \"improve religious superstitions, expose conspiracy groups, and maintain social order.\" In 1919, the project leader, Keiichiro Marui, based on investigation reports from the six bureaus and temple registers, presented the *Taiwan Religious Investigation Report (Volume One)*.\n\n\n（2）宗教調查\n\n西來庵事件後，總督府為「改善宗教迷信、糾舉陰謀團體、維護社會治安」，於1915-1918年進行三次宗教調查。1919年，計畫主持者丸井圭治郎根據六廳之調查報告與寺廟臺帳，提出《臺灣宗教調查報告書（第一卷）》。\n\n\nDue to relatively amicable relations between the authorities and missionaries, Christianity seldom incited the populace, and church records were easy to obtain, posing less of a threat to the government. Therefore, the investigation mainly focused on \"traditional beliefs.\" In March 1917, influenced by the religious investigation, the southern churches, led by Liu Junchen and others, began to establish a \"foundation.\" In December, Kono Masayoshi, Liu Xiwu, Liu Ruishan, and Yan Zhensheng jointly submitted an application, including documents such as the act of donation, property list, transfer deeds, and church constitution. The Governor-General's Office approved it in July 1918. In other words, the southern churches had completed their own statistical overview of church affairs before the government's religious investigation.\n\n\n由於當局和宣教師關係不惡，基督教少有「煽動」百姓的情事，教會的文書名冊也容易掌握，對政府較無威脅，因此調查的重點主要在於「舊慣信仰」。直到1917年3月，受到宗教調查的影響，南部教會託劉俊臣等籌設「財團法人」，12月由河野政喜、劉錫五、劉瑞山、顏振聲聯名提出申請書，附件有寄附行為、財產目錄、承讓書、教會憲法等文件，旋於1918年7月獲得總督府許可，換言之，南部教會已經先於政府的宗教調查，完成本身的教勢概況統計。\n\n\nThe southern churches, initially passively accepting official regulations, gained practical experience through several property and tax disputes. The early Japanese colonial religious investigations provided the Governor-General's Office with a better understanding and control of Christianity. The \"temple ledgers\" already recorded the numbers of \"church offices, preaching places, and missionaries,\" with detailed records of missionary activities and the rise and fall of religions. The Governor-General's Office also recognized the development potential of Christianity.\n\n\n南部教會從被動接受官方規章，而在數次產權、租稅爭議協調中獲得實務經驗。日治初期的宗教調查使總督府對基督教更為瞭解、掌握，「寺廟臺帳」已有記載「教務所、說教所、布教師」等數字，尤其是布教情形與宗教消長，都有詳細的紀錄。總督府也認為基督教具有發展潛力。\n\n\nFor local churches, the \"Evangelical Society,\" which expanded church affairs in various regions, was integrated into the \"Missionary Charity Society,\" unifying the previously disorganized and incoherent system, enhancing the efficiency of evangelism and relief efforts, and ensuring proper use of donations. The 1915 Xilai An Incident prompted the Governor-General's Office to commission Marui Keijiro to conduct a religious investigation, but its primary focus was on traditional religious practices and the psychological impact of folk beliefs on the Taiwanese people, with less emphasis on Christianity. Triggered by the religious investigation, the southern churches simultaneously carried out internal integration, established a \"foundation,\" and obtained legal recognition. Evidently, church-state relations entered a new phase.\n\n\n對地方教會而言，各地拓展教務的「宣道會」整合成為「佈教慈善會」，更能統一紊亂缺乏條理的制度，增進布教賑濟效率，使募款能妥善利用。1915年的西來庵事件爆發，促使總督府委任丸井圭治郎展開宗教調查，但是其主要目標偏向舊慣宗教的調查以及民間信仰對臺灣人心理層面的影響，較少討論基督教的部分。在宗教調查的觸動下，南部教會同時進行內部整合，設立「財團法人」，獲得法律上的確認。顯然的，政教關係步入新的階段。 \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nNo answer \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\n### (1) General International Diplomatic Relations: European War\n\n（1）一般國際外交關係：歐戰\n\n\n### (2) Diplomatic Relations of Christian Nations: Ecumenical Movement\n\n（2）基督教國家外交關係：普世合一運動\n\n\nThe Ecumenical Movement refers to the trend of church cooperation that began in the mid-19th century, especially evident in the 20th century. Its belief is that the churches of the world are essentially one and should work together to promote affairs, enhance church connections, and transcend denominational or traditional barriers, ultimately seeking \"the unity of humanity.\"\n\n\n普世合一運動（Ecumenical Movement）係指十九世紀中葉以降，尤其廿世紀所呈現的教會合作趨勢，其信念認為世上的教會本為一體，理應共同推動事務，促進教會連結，跨越教派或傳統的藩籬，最終謀求「人類的合一」。\n\n\nChristians place great importance on \"unity\" for a reason. Biblical doctrine holds that there is only one Jesus Christ, so all churches collectively are like Christ's singular \"bride.\" At the same time, the body of Jesus Christ is one, symbolizing that the fundamental meaning of the church lies in its reunification. The church, therefore, possesses both explicit and hidden characteristics, making the unity of all believers representative of the friendship between the church and the world.\n\n\n基督徒重視「合一」其來有自，因為聖經義理認為耶穌基督只有一位，所以全體教會就像是基督唯一的「新婦」；同時，耶穌基督的身體只有一個，象徵教會的根本意義在於歸復一體，教會因而兼有外顯與隱藏的特質，使得全體信徒的合一代表教會與世界的友誼。\n\n\nIn modern times, due to the active spread of the gospel by Christianity, various denominations gradually formed united, interdenominational missionary organizations. From a Christian perspective on the trends of the times: the 16th century was the era of the Reformation, the 17th century the era of denominationalism, the 18th century the era of immigrant dissemination, the 19th century the era of overseas missions, and the 20th century the era of the Ecumenical Movement.\n\n近代，由於基督教積極傳播福音，各個宗派漸漸成立聯合性、超越宗派的宣教組織。若以基督教的觀點來看時代思潮，十六世紀為宗教改革時代，十七世紀為宗派主義時代，十八世紀為移民傳播時代，十九世紀為海外宣教時代，廿世紀則為合一運動時代。\n\n\nIn 1910, the Edinburgh Conference was held, regarded as the starting point of the Ecumenical Movement. The missionary achievements in Taiwan were included in the conference's report, which explicitly stated, \"Everything is favorable for active progress in Taiwan. On such a small land, there are so few obstacles, and the conditions are so conducive to rapid and thorough evangelization.\" Later, the \"World Council of Churches\" (WCC), established in 1948, has long been the world's largest international Christian organization. By the early 21st century, it had over 200 denominations and organizations and 40 million member churches worldwide. Taiwan is notably an active member. Clearly, the Ecumenical Movement is indeed a significant issue in the history of modern Christian development.\n\n\n1910年，愛丁堡大會召開，被稱為普世合一運動的起點，臺灣的宣教成果名列大會的報告書內容中，明揭「一切都有利於在臺灣積極進取。在不大的土地上，障礙如此之少，而且條件如此有利於迅速而徹底的傳福音。」之後，1948年成立的「普世教會協會」（World Council of Churches, WCC，簡稱普世教協）長期以來都是世界最大的國際基督教組織，至廿一世紀初，全球有200多個宗派和團體、4000萬間成員教會。其中，臺灣更是甚為活躍的會員國。顯然的，合一運動實為近代基督教發展史的重要課題\n\n\n### (3) The Nationalist Situation in Our Society: Inland Extensionism\n\n（3）本國社會的民族主義狀況：內地延長主義\n\nIs there suppose to be something here???
