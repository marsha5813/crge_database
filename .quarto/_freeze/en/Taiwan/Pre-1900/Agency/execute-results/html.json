He graduated from the Medical School of the University of Edinburgh in 1858 and served at the General Hospital in Birmingham, England, qualifying as a doctor. In 1860, under the suggestion of Carstairs Douglas, a missionary of the English Presbyterian Church stationed in Xiamen, Maxwell was assigned to learn Minnan (Hokkien) Chinese. In the autumn of the same year, Maxwell and Douglas came to Taiwan for inspection. In May of the following year, they, along with Alexander Wylie and Chinese assistants Chen Zilu, Wu Jiazhi, and Wu Wenshui, went to Tainan to establish a church. Initially, they conducted medical missionary work in West Street in Tainan. However, they faced opposition from local gentry who incited attacks by the masses, accusing foreign doctors of killing Chinese people to extract brains and eyes for making opium. They then moved to Dagou (modern-day Kaohsiung) and established the first Presbyterian church in southern Taiwan. In 1865, Maxwell and William A. Pickering, a British customs officer in Anping, went to Tainan and Kaohsiung to evangelize to the Plains Indigenous people. Maxwell found that the Plains Indigenous people were more receptive to Christianity than the Han Chinese.\n\n馬雅各（James Laidlaw Maxwell，1836.3.18-1921.3.6）。宣教士，蘇格蘭人，1858年畢業於愛丁堡大學醫學院，並曾在英國伯明罕總醫院（General Hospital, Birmingham）服務，有醫生資格。1860年在廈門傳教的英國長老教會宣教士杜嘉德（Carstairs Douglas）1864年來到台灣滬尾（今淡水）考察，認為台灣既通行閩南語，應由駐廈門的教會前來設教，於是鼓吹母會差遣宣教士前去（賴永祥1990：273-274）。同年初，馬雅各受派到廈門，在此學習閩南語，並在秋天與杜嘉德來台考察，隔年5月與杜嘉德、魏理（Alexander Wylie）以及華人助手陳子路、吳嘉智、吳文水到台南開教。最初他們在台南看西街進行醫療傳教，但遭仕紳慫恿群眾攻擊，稱洋醫生殺害漢人取腦挖眼晴製造鴉片，後轉向打狗（今高雄）的旗後並在此設立南部首間長老教會（賴永祥1992：7-16；潘稀棋2004：57-61）。1865年他和安平海關官員英商必麒麟（W.A. Pickering）前往台南、高雄平埔族宣教，他發現平埔族較漢人容易接受基督教，\n\nAfter the uprising of Han Chinese communities in 1868, the focus of missionary work shifted to the Plains Indigenous peoples (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 20-21; Lin Jinshui, 118-112). Apart from pioneering the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, James Laidlaw Maxwell made two significant contributions: 1. Medical missionary work. Initially adopting a \"chapel cum clinic\" model in Dagou, he later opened medical clinics in Dagou, Fengshan, and Tainan, which eventually became the predecessors of the present-day Sin-Lau Hospital. Maxwell's medical skills at the time were truly remarkable, making him the pioneer of modern Western medicine in Taiwan (Lai Yongxiang, 1995: 1-4). Regarding medical missionary work, Maxwell put forward several perspectives: (1) Medical missions could promote scientific thinking and dispel superstitions; (2) They could demonstrate the integration of Christian action and doctrine; (3) They could be highly effective in spreading \"truth\"; (4) Work in pharmacies and hospitals was crucial in winning souls. Thus, he vigorously advocated for the combination of medicine and evangelism as the most powerful approach to missionary work (Maxwell, 1869: 112-113); 2. Translation and publication of the Vernacular Bible. In 1873, Maxwell and other missionaries translated and supervised the printing of the first Vernacular New Testament, titled *Lán ê Kiù-chú Iâ-so͘ Ki-tok ê sin-iok* (Our Savior Jesus Christ's New Testament), published in Glasgow. In 1884, the Old Testament was published under the title *Kü Iok ê Sèng Keng* (The Bible of the Old Testament) by the British Bible Society (Lai Yongxiang, 25). Vernacular script was educational at the time, enabling many illiterate individuals to learn to read within a short period, facilitating the reading of the Bible and other new knowledge. In 1880, he donated a set of Roman type printing presses to promote the use of the Vernacular script (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 73).\n\n1868年漢人群體教案四起後更是將宣教重點放在平埔族宣教（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：20-21；林金水118-112）。馬雅各的貢獻除了在於為英國長老教會開拓台灣傳教區以外，尚有兩項重點：1. 醫療傳道。初期他在旗後採「禮拜堂兼診所」模式，後陸續在此地、鳳山、府城（台南）開設醫館，即為今日新樓醫院前身。而馬雅各當時行醫的療效確實令時人震驚，可謂台灣近代西洋醫學鼻祖（賴永祥1995：1-4）。關於醫療傳道，馬雅各曾提出幾點看法：(1)醫療宣教能增進科學思維，打破迷信；(2) 能展示基督教行動與教義的結合；(3) 對傳播「真理」有莫大功效；(4) 在藥局和醫院的工作，是贏得靈魂的重要禾場。因此他大力鼓吹醫藥和傳道的結合是宣教工作最有力的途徑（Maxwell 1869: 112-113）；2. 翻譯與出版白話字聖經。1873年，馬雅各和其他宣教士譯妥並監印第一本閩南語白話字新約全書，名為Lán ê Kiù- chú Iâ-so͘ Ki-tok ê sin-iok（咱的救主耶穌基督的新約），在格拉斯哥出版；1884年則出版舊約，名為Kü Iok ê Sèng Keng（舊約的聖經），由英國聖經公會出版（賴永祥25）。白話字當時具教育功能，讓許多不識漢字的文盲能在短期內學會，以利閱讀聖經和其他新知，他在1880年捐贈一套羅馬字印刷機以推廣白話字的使用（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：73）。\n\n\n2)George Leslie Mackay (1844.3.21-1901.6.2), a missionary also known as Mackay Ruiru in Chinese, was of Scottish descent, born in Ontario, Canada, and passed away in Danshui, Taiwan. Inspired by William C. Burns during his childhood, he aspired to become a missionary. After studying theology at the University of Toronto and Princeton Theological Seminary, he returned to Canada for pastoral ministry. In September 1870, he applied to the Overseas Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada to become a missionary. The following year, he was ordained and arrived in Dagou (modern-day Kaohsiung), Taiwan, at the end of the year. Shortly after, he began his ministry in Danshui, expanding the church through itinerant evangelism. Over 29 years of missionary work in Taiwan, he established approximately 60 churches, many of which were in the Kavalan tribal areas of the Lanyang Plain, with 38 established by 1888 (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 86-90; Mackay, 2007: 3-14). Many descendants of the Kavalan tribe adopted the Chinese surname \"偕\" (Xie), in memory of Mackay, highlighting his significant influence at the time. Mackay made significant contributions to the Presbyterian Church in Canada's missions in Taiwan and the development of Presbyterian churches in northern Taiwan. He also laid down principles of localization and contextualization, particularly by actively nurturing local evangelists (Lin Jinshui, 163; Xie Dali, 303-313).\n\n馬偕（George Leslie Mackay，1844.3.21-1901.6.2），宣教士，漢名偕叡理，蘇格蘭裔，生於加拿大安大略省，卒於淡水。幼時受賓威廉（William C. Burns）感召，立志成為宣教士。先後在多倫多大學和普林斯頓神學院修習神學，後返回加拿大牧會，1870年9月向加拿大長老會海外宣道會申請成為海外宣教士，隔年被按立，年底從汕頭抵達打狗，稍後到淡水開教，並以巡迴宣教的方式拓展教會，其在台宣教29年總共建立約60間教會，其中不少是蘭陽平原噶瑪蘭族地區的教會，至1888年有38間（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：86-90；馬偕2007：3-14）。不少噶瑪蘭族後裔取漢姓「偕」，以紀念馬偕，足見其當時影響力。馬偕對加拿大長老教會在台宣教以及北台灣長老教會的發展貢獻甚鉅，也立下本土化和處境化的原則，尤其積極培養本地傳道人員（林金水163；謝大立303-313）。\n\nIn addition, Mackay made pioneering contributions in three areas that were groundbreaking for northern Taiwan and the church at that time:\n\n\n1. **Medical Evangelism and Introduction of Western Medicine**: Mackay not only laid the precedent of using medical care as a means of evangelism but also advocated for the study of Western medicine among his students. He collaborated with British Consulate physician Ringer, who supplied medications and raised funds. They rented a house next to Mackay's residence for medical practice. Later, they were joined by Jacob W. K. Fraser and C. H. Johansen in medical work. In 1880, with donations received, Mackay established the Hu-wei Clinic (formerly known as Danshui) next to the Danshui Church, the first Western clinic in the northern region. By 1890, it had treated 3,696 patients, ceasing operation after Mackay's death in 1901 (Taiwan Presbyterian Church History Committee, 1965: 49-53).\n\n\n此外，馬偕還在三方面對當時北台灣和教會而言為創舉且帶來貢獻：1. 醫療傳道和引進西醫。他除了奠定以醫療為傳教途徑的先例，也在學生當中鼓吹學習西方醫學。此外他與英國領事侍醫林格（Ringer）合作，由其供應藥品並募捐基金，在馬偕寓所旁租屋行醫，後來又得華雅各（J.B. Fraser）和約翰生（C.H. Johansen）加入醫療工作。1880年馬偕得到捐款，在淡水教會旁開設滬尾（淡水舊名）偕醫館，是北部第一間西醫診所，1890當年達到3696名患者，至1901年馬偕過世後停止運作（台灣基督長老教會歷史委員會1965：49-53）；\n\n2. **Establishment of the \"Academy\" (later called Oxford College)**: In 1882, Mackay founded the \"Academy\" to provide education for the local people. The curriculum was not limited to theology and biblical knowledge but also included natural sciences, music, physical education, and other subjects, continuing the spirit of the Scottish Enlightenment movement embedded in Mackay's earlier mobile education initiative, the \"Roaming Academy.\"\n\n\n2. 1882年建立「理學堂大書院」（後稱牛津學堂）提供本地人教育，課程不限於神學和聖經知識，也包含自然科學、音樂、體育等科，延續稍早馬偕流動教育「逍遙學院」蘊含的蘇格蘭啟蒙運動精神；\n\n3. **Women's Education**: In 1884, the Danshui Girls' School was established. Besides practical considerations for missionary work, it had revolutionary significance for the advancement of women's knowledge and social status at that time.\n\n\n3. 女子教育。1884年設立淡水女學堂，除了有宣教工作的實際考量，但是對當時女性知識以及社會地位的提升而言具革命性的意義。\n\n\n3) Gao Chang (1837 - 1912.9.16). Born in Jinjiang County, Quanzhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, he passed away in the Tai Ping Jing Church in 1912. In 1864, he came to Tainan seeking employment. He later attended services at the Kanxi Street Chapel (now the Kanxi Street Church of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan) where he heard sermons and became acquainted with George Leslie Mackay. In 1866, he was baptized, becoming one of the first baptized believers of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan. After baptism, he studied under Wu Wenshui, an assistant to George Leslie Mackay, and soon aspired to become a preacher. He received training in the \"Believers' Training Class\" or \"Preachers' Training Class\" (the predecessor of Tainan Theological College) established by George Leslie Mackay to nurture local preachers. The classes were conducted in vernacular script (Romanized Hokkien) (Gao Junming, 2001:). In July 1867, Wu Wenshui and Gao Chang served as the first ministers of the Bitou Church. On April 11 of the following year, they were assaulted and injured by mobs in the \"Bitou Persecution Incident.\" They sought help from the authorities but were detained for fifty days. With the assistance of the British Consul in Hong Kong, sought by George Leslie Mackay, they were eventually released (Gao Junming, 2001: 26-36; Lai Yongxiang, 1992: 47-50).\n\n高長（1837 -1912.9.16）。生於福建省泉州府晉江縣，1912年卒於太平境教會。1864年到台南謀職，後在看西街禮拜堂（今台灣基督長老教會看西街教會）聽道並與馬雅各相識，於1866年受洗，為長老教會在台第一批受洗信徒之一。受洗後，向馬雅各的助手吳文水學道，未久立志傳道。他在馬雅各為培育本地籍傳道者而設立的「信徒造就班」或稱「傳道者養成班」（即台南神學院前身）接受訓練課，均是以白話字（閩南語羅馬字）進行（高俊明，2001：）。1867年7月，吳文水與高長擔任埤頭教會首任傳道師，隔年4月11日因教案「埤頭迫害事件」遭暴徒打受傷，向官府求助，反被關押五十天。在馬雅各尋求英國駐香港領事的協助下，才得以釋放（高俊明2001：26-36；賴永祥1992：47-50）。\n\n\nBetween 1870 and 1886, Gao Chang went to indigenous Paiwan tribes in Muzha, Kaohsiung (now Neimen District), Nantou, and other places to lead churches. In 1886, he and William Campbell went to Penghu for missionary work, becoming pioneers of Protestantism in Penghu. In 1889, Gao Chang returned to the Muzha Church for a period of 8 years. From early 1891 to the end of 1892, he was stationed at the Shihpai Chapel in the eastern region (now the Fuli Church of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan), crossing the Central Mountain Range at an advanced age. Among Gao Chang's descendants, five sons and three daughters, the eldest son (adopted) Gao Jinsheng (the fifth locally ordained pastor) and the second son Gao Duxing were both pastors. The third son, Gao Zaidé (the father of the renowned pastor Gao Junming), the fourth son Gao Zaiju (the father of Gao Yaodong, an early leader of the Assemblies of God in Taiwan), and the fifth son Gao Zaifu were all doctors. The eldest daughter, Gao Ajin, was the wife of a missionary, while the second daughter, Gao Xiuyuan, and the third daughter, Gao Xiuli, were both married to doctors (Gao Junming, 2001: 36). Gao Chang, besides being one of the first baptized members of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, was also the first local Protestant missionary. He was an early church pioneer for the Taiwan Presbyterian Church, and the network of believers formed by his descendants was of significant importance to the Taiwanese church.\n\n\n1870年到1886年期間，高長前往高雄木柵（今內門區）、南投等平埔族原住民部落帶領教會。1886年與甘為霖（William Campbell）到澎湖傳道，兩人為新教在澎湖開展的先驅。1889年，高長再駐木柵教會長達8年; 1891年初至1892年底，則駐於東部的石牌禮拜堂（今台灣基督長老教會富里教會），當時是以耳順之齡跨越中央山脈赴任。高長後代5男3女之中，長男（養子）高金聲（第5位被設立的本地籍牧師）與次男高篤行都是牧師；三男高再得（即是名牧高俊明之父）、四男高再祝（神召會在台早期領袖高耀東之父）、五男高再福都是醫師。長女高阿金為傳道之妻，次女高秀圓、三女高秀理均嫁予醫師（高俊明2001：36）。高長除了是台灣首批受洗長老教會信徒，也是首位本地新教傳道者，對台灣基督長老教會而言是早期教會開拓者，其後代構成的信徒家族網絡對台灣教會而言亦是意義非凡。\n\n\nWilliam Campbell (1841.4.11-1921.9.7) was a missionary born in Glasgow, Scotland, in the United Kingdom. After graduating from the University of Glasgow, he pursued theological studies at the Glasgow branch of the Free Church College, Glasgow (Campbell 2009: 1-4). In 1871, he arrived in Taiwan and soon began touring the indigenous Paiwan mission areas in Kaohsiung and Tainan, and in 1886, he expanded his work to Penghu (Pan Xiqi 2004: 53-57; Campbell 1874: 410-412). His main contributions include:\n\n\n甘為霖（William Campbell，1841.4.11-1921.9.7）。宣教士，生於英國蘇格蘭格拉斯哥，格拉斯哥大學畢業後，在蘇格蘭自由教會神學院格拉斯哥分校（Free Church College, Glasgow）修讀神學課程（甘為霖 2009：1-4）。1871年他抵達台灣，未久就進入高雄、台南平埔族宣教區巡視，1886年更是到澎湖開拓（潘稀棋2004：53-57；Campbell 1874: 410-412）。他的主要貢獻在於：\n\n1. Advancing special education for the visually impaired, earning him the title of \"Father of Blind Education in Taiwan.\" In 1884, he encountered a blind seeker in Yanqian, Tainan, who had been blinded by assailants, which inspired his concern for the visually impaired. He introduced the Romanized Braille system and produced several Braille books, including the Gospel of Matthew and catechism manuals, primarily sponsored by the British and Foreign Bible Society. He raised £525 for blind ministry through the Free Church Student Missionary Society in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n\n1.推動視障特殊教育，有台灣盲人教育之父稱譽。1884年他在台南岩前遇到被暴徒挖眼致盲的慕道者，啟發其對視障人士的關注。他引入羅馬拼音點字系統，並完成好些點字書籍，包含聖經馬太福音、教理問答手冊等，主要由英國及海外聖經公會（British  and Foreign Bible Society）負責。他向蘇格蘭格拉斯哥自由教會學徒傳道會（Free Church Student Missionary Society）籌募盲人事工款項525英鎊。\n\nIn 1891, he began renting Honggong Temple (Tainan Wen Chang Temple) as a blind school, named \"Xungu Tang,\" with a lease term of 5 years and an annual rent of 60 yuan. However, after Japan took over Taiwan, in 1900, Taiwan Governor-General Goto Shimpei ordered the establishment of the \"Tainan Benevolent Institute,\" with an attached education department to continue its work (Pan Xiqi 2004: 70-79; Lai Yongxiang 1990: 213-215; Campbell 2009: 246-251).\n\n\n1891年他開始租用洪公祠（台南文昌廟）為盲校，名為訓瞽堂，租期5年，每年租金60元。但日本領台後，1900年台灣總督兒玉源太郎命令指定「台南慈惠院」附設教育部門接續其工作（潘稀棋2004：70-79；賴永祥 1990：213-215；甘為霖 2009：246-251）；\n\nHe also compiled and translated documents and historical materials from the Dutch colonial period and organized the missionary history of Taiwan during the Dutch colonial period. This includes works like \"The Gospel of Matthew in Sinkang-Formosan, Dutch and English\" (1888), \"An Account of Missionary Success in Formosa\" (1889), \"The Article of Christian Instruction in Favorlang-English, Dutch and English\" (1896), \"Formosa Under the Dutch\" (1903), among others. Additionally, he authored other books such as \"Sketches From Formosa\" (1915), which was translated into Chinese as \"Sketches of Formosa: William Campbell's Taiwan Notes.\" William Campbell's contributions were substantial, and in 1915, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Theology degree by Knox College in Canada (Lai Yongxiang 1990: 108-113).\n\n\n2.編譯荷治時期文獻、史料和整理荷治時期台灣宣教歷史。包括《新港腔馬太福音傳》（The Gospel of Matthew in Sinkang-Formosan, Dutch and English, 1888）、《台灣佈教之成功》（An Account of Missionary Success in Formosa ,1889）、《法波蘭語信仰個條書》（The Article of Christian Instruction in Favorlang-English, Dutch and English, 1896）、《荷蘭統治下的福爾摩沙》（Formosa Under the Dutch, 1903）等。此外，他還著有其他書籍如《台灣素描》（ Sketches From Formosa, 1915，中文譯本《素描福爾摩沙：甘為霖台灣筆記》）。甘為霖著作等身，1915年獲加拿大諾克斯學院（Knox College）頒贈榮譽神學博士（賴永祥 1990：108-113）；\n\n\nHe also compiled a dictionary of Minnan Romanized script and promoted its use. Campbell compiled the \"Xiamen Phonetic New Dictionary,\" which drew information from the \"Kangxi Dictionary,\" \"Shiwuyin,\" \"English and Chinese Extempore,\" etc. Although it was named after Xiamen phonetics, it included a wide range of pronunciations from Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Taiwanese common dialects. Because his local assistants were Lin Jinsheng and Chen Daluo, it leaned closer to the Tainan accent (Lai Yongxiang 1990: 95-97; Pan Xiqi 2004: 141).\n\n\n3. 編纂閩南語白話字字典，推行白話字。甘為霖編纂《廈門音新字典》，資料來自《康熙字典》、《十五音》、《英華口才集》等，雖曰廈門音，但音廣泛取自漳泉台通用土音，並因本地助手為林錦生與陳大鑼，故較靠近台南腔調（賴永祥 1990：95-97；潘稀棋2004：141）。\n\n\n5) Thomas Barclay (1849.11.21-1935.10.5). Missionary, born in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, the Scottish Free Church Theological College, and Leipzig University in Germany. During his junior year, Barclay collaborated with John Campbell Gibson, who later also became a missionary, to measure the special dielectric induction of solvents. Their findings were included in William Thompson's thesis, leading to Barclay's name being published in the Encyclopedia Britannica. He arrived in Taiwan in 1875 and in 1877 merged the training classes for missionaries in Takao (modern-day Kaohsiung) and Tainan, calling it \"The University,\" which later became the precursor to Tainan Theological College, officially opening in 1880. Barclay served as its first principal (Pan Xiqi, 2003: 13-18, 29, 36-37).\n\n巴克禮（Thomas Barclay, 1849.11.21-1935.10.5）。宣教士，生於英國蘇格蘭格拉斯哥，在格拉斯哥大學、蘇格蘭自由教會神學院、德國萊比錫大學接受教育。巴克禮在大三時與日後亦成為宣教士的汲約翰（John Campbell Gibson）進行電介體（Dielectics）之特殊電感應溶量之測量，成果被列入William Thompson論文中，使其姓名被刊登在大英百科全書。1875年抵台，1877年將打狗和台南兩地的傳道者養成班合併，稱為「大學」，為台南神學院前身，於1880年正式開學，巴克禮擔任首任校長（潘稀棋2003：13-18、29、36-37）。\n\n\nHis contributions extended beyond education to include translating the Bible, promoting vernacular script, and publishing educational materials. He believed that Christians needed to study the Bible. Despite the success of Dutch missions in Taiwan in the 17th century, the loss of Christian faith after changes in political power occurred because the Bible had not been translated into the local language (only the Gospel of Matthew existed at that time). Recognizing that using Chinese characters would not be effective given the prevalence of illiteracy, he advocated for the use of vernacular script. Using Jacob May's donated printing press, Barclay personally traveled to England to study typesetting and printing. In 1884, he established the \"Gathered Treasures Hall,\" the origin of printing in Tainan. In 1894, the Presbyterian Church of England donated funds for the expansion of the printing press, which became a printing factory. In 1885, Barclay founded the first newspaper in Taiwan using vernacular script, the \"Taiwan Fucheng Church News,\" which was the precursor to the \"Taiwan Church News\" (Lai Yongxiang, 1990: 17-18, 59-60; Pan Xiqi, 2003: 64-65; Barclay, 2022: 180-181, 283-286). Additionally, in October 1895, during the Japanese army's preparations to besiege Tainan, Barclay and others, including Duncan Ferguson, met with General Nogi Maresuke to prevent bloodshed. As a result, Barclay was awarded the Fifth Class Order of the Rising Sun by Emperor Meiji in 1897, and the citizens of Tainan presented him with a scroll in gratitude (Pan Xiqi, 2003: 70-72; Barclay, 2022: 236-237).\n\n\n其貢獻除了教育，還在於翻譯聖經、推行白話字、文教出版。他認為基督徒需要研讀聖經，17世紀荷蘭在台宣教雖稱成功，但在政權交替後，基督教信仰流失，即是因為未將聖經譯為本地語言（當時僅有馬太福音）。他認為若以眼下文盲為眾的情況，使用漢字將無法達成目標，只有白話字可以。他以馬雅各奉獻的印刷機為器具，並自行赴英學習檢字、印刷，在1884年成立「聚珍堂」，為台南印刷業濫觴，1894年英國長老教會再為台灣教會印刷工作捐款，擴建為印刷廠。巴克禮在1885年創立以白話字印行的報紙《台灣府城教會報》，是台灣首份報紙，即是《台灣教會公報》前身（賴永祥1990：17-18、59-60；潘稀棋2003：64-65；巴克禮2022：180-181、283-286）。此外，他在1895年10月日軍準備圍攻台南府城之際，與宋忠堅（Duncan Ferguson）等人前往軍營會見乃木希典以避免流血事件發生，1897年他因此獲明治天皇頒五等旭日勳章，台南市民亦贈與卷軸以表感謝（潘稀棋2003：70-72；巴克禮 2022：236-237）。 \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nPromotion of Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) romanization and establishment of Taiwan Prefectural City Church News\n\nMissionaries such as George Leslie Mackay, William Gauld, and Thomas Barclay vigorously promoted the use of the Minnan language Pe̍h-ōe-jī romanization system established in Xiamen. Barclay advocated that for the church to be strong, every member, regardless of gender, should be able to read the Bible independently, a feat unattainable through Chinese characters but achievable through Romanized Vernacular. He claimed that ordinary people could learn to read a whole Bible in Romanized Vernacular within 4 to 5 weeks, far more efficiently than with Chinese characters. He cited Dr. Bonfield of the British and Foreign Bible Society, who observed that church believers in Taiwan could read the Bible better than believers in other Chinese churches, attributing this to Pe̍h-ōe-jī. He believed that Chinese characters and Romanization were not in opposition but could be seen as complementary means of learning. In 1885, Barclay issued the inaugural edition of the Taiwan Prefectural City Church News, Taiwan's first newspaper, which became a crucial medium for promoting Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Earlier, he organized a large meeting in Tainan where believers freely expressed themselves. He later excerpted these speeches and published them in the Taiwan Prefectural City Church News. People were delighted to see their speeches printed in typeface, leading to an increase in circulation, from 500 copies shortly after its launch to 670 copies within two years, and reaching 700 copies by 1897. Issues one to three of the newspaper reported on the earlier essay contest titled \"The Benefits of Pe̍h-ōe-jī\" held in Xiamen, extensively reprinting the articles of the top four contestants: Yeh Hanzhang (Zhangzhou Xiaoxi), Liu Maoqing (Taiwan Prefectural City), Li Chalai (Gulangyu), Huang Deshan (Xiamen), and Lu Sanyuan (Gulangyu), to promote Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Especially, Taiwanese contestant Liu Maoqing highlighted the benefits of Pe̍h-ōe-jī from the perspective of social equality, emphasizing its accessibility to those who couldn't receive Chinese character education, allowing them to acquire knowledge through Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Pe̍h-ōe-jī wasn't limited to religious texts but also encompassed linguistics, medicine, literature education, Chinese history, applied literature, and fiction. It not only fulfilled the missionaries' expectation of enhancing faith knowledge but also served as a vehicle for accessing modern knowledge (Chen Muzhen 2015: 73).\n\n\n推行白話字以及《台灣府城教會報》的創刊（Promotion of Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) romanization and establishment of Taiwan Prefectural City Church News）。馬雅各、甘為霖、巴克禮等宣教士來台後戮力推行宣教士在廈門創立的閩南語白話字書寫系統，巴克禮主張若教會要健全，無論男女每一位會友都要能自己閱讀聖經，但這點不能藉助漢字達成，只有羅馬字（Romanized Vernacular）可以。他表示一般人能在4到5週學會閱讀整本羅馬字聖經，效率遠勝漢字。他指出大英聖書公會文顯理博士（Dr. Bonfield）觀察到，台灣教會信徒比其他中國教會信徒更能閱讀聖經，巴克禮歸功於白話字。他認為漢字和羅馬字並非對立，而可以理解為學習漢字的手段。1885年巴克禮發行首期《台灣府城教會報》，是台灣第一份報紙，即成推行白話字的重要媒介。在此稍早他在台南辦了一場大會，讓信徒暢所欲言，過後他將這些發言摘錄，刊於《台灣府城教會報》，人們初次見到自己的發言被印成鉛字而感到欣喜，也促使該報發行量攀升，創刊不到兩年即從500份升至670份，1897年到700份之譜（巴克禮181-182、283-286；陳慕真2015：63-65、70）。該報一至三期更是報導稍早廈門舉辦的「白話字的利益」徵文比賽，並大幅轉刊前四名參賽作者葉漢章（漳州小溪）、劉茂清（台灣府城）、李插來（鼓浪嶼）、黃德善（廈門）、盧三源（鼓浪嶼）的文章，以推行白話字。尤其台籍劉茂清更是由階級平等的觀點提出白話字的益處，即普羅大眾性，當時無法接受漢字教育者均能透過白話字吸收知識。而白話字不限於印行宗教文獻，還包含語言學、醫學、文學教育、中國歷史、應用文、小說，不僅達致宣教士期望的增進信仰知識，也是接觸現代新知的載體（陳慕真2015：73）。 \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\nWorship of \"Shénzhǔ\" (Ancestral Tablets) Issue\n\nDuring that time, Protestant churches in Taiwan were predominantly of the Presbyterian system, and thus, there were no significant controversies in terms of structure, doctrine, or translational names. The use of the Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) romanization system, primarily translated by George Leslie Mackay, for the Bible was widely accepted, and there were no discussions regarding translation. The primary faith issue faced within the church was related to the \"Ritual Controversy\" during the process of conversion, with a focus on the worship of \"Shénzhǔ\" (ancestral tablets).\n\n\nBritish missionaries recognized the significance of this issue and openly called for essays in both Taiwanese and Mandarin regions. From 23 submitted essays, those by Wensanyuan, Lichalai, Yeh Hanzhang, Li Jiji, and Cai Tianshang were selected. Between 1886 and 1888, these articles were serialized under the title \"Debate on Shénzhǔ\" in the Taiwan Prefectural City Church News, with Yeh Hanzhang having the most contributions. The discussions in these articles often began with the historical origin and motivations behind setting up ancestral tablets. They tended to affirm the original intention of paying respects to ancestors and commemorating their virtues, with the secondary aim of hoping for blessings from the ancestors' spirits. However, contemporary perspectives leaned more towards the latter.\n\n\nFurthermore, the articles critiqued the irrational aspects of ancient practices such as \"Shīzhǔ\" (the deceased descendant sitting to receive sacrifices on behalf of the dead) and \"Mùzhǔ\" (ancestral tablets). For example, having a junior family member act as \"Shīzhǔ\" receiving sacrifices from senior family members was seen as contradicting the principles of filial piety. The use of \"Mùzhǔ\" was historically restricted to emperors and princes, not to be used by officials below the rank of ministers. The widespread use of \"Mùzhǔ\" by the general public was considered an inappropriate emulation of imperial practices. Critics argued that the ancestral spirits did not reside in the wooden tablets, and people were essentially worshipping the craftsmanship of the tablet makers.\n\n\nMoreover, treating wood as if it were one's ancestors was seen as a violation of filial piety, contrary to the teachings of the Ten Commandments. Authors quoted Confucius's teachings on filial piety, urging people to be filial to their parents but to also obey the will of God. They listed exemplary filial children throughout history and biblical figures, encouraging believers to follow their examples. Christians were reminded to mourn their parents with a sorrowful heart but advised against sacrificing or worshipping ancestors. The authors quoted the Fifth Commandment from the Ten Commandments to argue that filial children would receive blessings and that ancient filial children had already received blessings from God.\n\n\nThese articles condemned the worship of ancestral tablets as foolish and erroneous, urging people to believe in the one true God, adhere to the teachings of \"Honoring your father and mother\" in the Ten Commandments, and fulfill the \"true path of filial piety\" (Taiwan Presbyterian Church General Assembly History Committee 1965: 16; Wang Zhengwen 2012: 10; Li Chalai 1888: 38; Yeh Hanzhang 1887: 23; Yeh Hanzhang 1887.5: 35).\n\n祭祀「神主」議題。當時台灣的新教教會均為長老教會體系，因此在制度、教義、譯名方面並未出現明顯爭議，而當時普遍使用馬雅各主譯的白話字聖經，也未出現翻譯方面的討論。教內主要面對的信仰議題是改宗過程中「禮儀之爭」的問題，尤以祭祀「神主」為要。英國宣教士發現此議題的重要性，於是在台閩兩地公開徵文，在23篇來文中選出溫三源、李插來、葉漢章、李記際、蔡天賞五人的文章，1886年到1888年間以「辯神主論」為題《台灣府城教會報》連載，對於祭祀祖先之神主牌位的問題進行討論，以葉漢章連載次數最多。這些文章多從設立神主的歷史起源和動機論起，傾向肯定原初慎終追遠、紀念祖先德行的動機，其次才是盼望祖先的靈降福，但今人卻全然傾向後者。此外，文章評論古時「尸主」（由死者孫輩端坐，代替死者接受家族獻祭跪拜）和「木主」（神主牌位）的不合理之處，例如，若由晚輩擔任「尸主」接受長輩獻祭跪拜，豈非有違五倫？而「木主」在古代只有帝王諸侯能夠設立木主，從卿大夫以下均不得設立。現時眾人廣設木主，實乃是僭權行帝王諸侯之禮。古時帝王設立木主，只到7代，諸侯5代，大夫3代，現在卻到10代以上，並不合宜。論者並指出排位只是木頭，祖宗的靈魂不會在此居住；人花錢向製作牌位的師傅購買，向牌位跪拜，實則拜的是創作牌位的師傅；此外，將木頭當作先人其實是干犯不孝之罪，違背十誡孝敬父母的教導。有作者引用孔子對孝的教訓，勸人孝順父母，但更要服從上帝的旨意。其列出歷代著名孝子和聖經內的偉人，勸信徒比照仿效，更要基督徒以悲傷的心追悼父母，但不要獻祭或膜拜祖先。並引用十誡中的第五誡論證孝子能得福氣，而古代的孝子已經得到上帝的祝福。這些文章指責拜神主為愚昧和錯誤之舉，並勸人相信獨一真神，順從十誡中「孝敬父母」的教訓，以盡「真實的孝道」（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：16；王政文2012：10；李插來 1888：38；葉漢章1887：23；葉漢章1887.5：35）。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nWu Chi-kau (Ngô Chì-ko), born on January 3, 1827, with the milk name Qiang and the courtesy name Yuping, was born in Tan Di, Fenchihu, Chiayi County, Taiwan (now in Hedong Village, Baihe District, Tainan City). In his early years, he defeated local tycoon Wu Zhenkun and constructed irrigation systems such as the Baishui River Canal, the Touqian River Canal, and the Machouhou Canal. In addition, for his contributions to quelling the Taichōshun Incident in 1863, he was awarded the title of magistrate of Douliu. He also built the Magistrate's Office, restored the Dianzai Kou Wen Shrine, established the Yushan Academy, and donated funds for temple construction. All these endeavors helped him establish a solid local power base.\n\n\nHowever, he harbored hostility towards Christians. In 1875, under the pretext that the church built by George Leslie Mackay in Baishui River would disrupt the feng shui of the Wu family's ancestral tombs, he sent people to burn down the church and Mackay's residence. After the court trial, Wu Chi-kau was acquitted but had to bear compensation costs. Nevertheless, he did not stop there; he continued to gather supporters to attack Christians in the Baishui River area.\n\n\nIn 1876, conflicts arose between church member Wen Wang and Wu Chi-kau and his allies, including Zhang Xing. Wen Wang was first blinded by Wu Chi-kau's henchmen, and in April 1877, he was killed by Wu Chi-kau at the head of Niuchou. Wen Wang's son, Wen Mu, and Xiang Maochun were also injured by Zhang Xing and others with knives. In November of the same year, Wu Chi-kau's followers again burned down the Jibei Church. Mackay sought the intervention of British Consul A. Frater, and the Chiayi County government held a public trial in front of Yanqian, where Wu Chi-kau, realizing his wrongdoings, built a new church as compensation.\n\n\nIn local records and historical materials, Wu Chi-kau's image appears positive due to his significant contributions to local development. However, he realized that the presence of the church challenged his dominance in the Baishui River area as the church began to influence the local residents. The church's continued expansion beyond his control would undoubtedly undermine his dominant position. Thus, he resorted to violent means to prevent the uncontrolled presence of Christians within his sphere of influence.\n\n\n吳志高（Wu Chi-kau[Ngô Chì-ko], 1827.1.3-1880）。乳名墻，字玉屏，生於台灣府嘉義縣糞箕湖莊潭底（今台南市白河區河東里），早年因打敗地方土豪吳振坤，在地方上修築白水溪圳、頭前溪圳、馬稠後圳，加上1863年平定戴潮春事件有功而受賞斗六都司銜。此外，他興建都司府、修復店仔口文祠、創立玉山書院，並捐款興建廟宇。凡此種種，讓他建立穩固的地方勢力。但是他偏惡基督徒，1875年藉口甘為霖在白水溪建立教堂會破壞吳家祖墳風水，遂派人燒毀教堂以及甘為霖住所。對簿公堂後吳志高被判無罪，但須負擔賠償。然而吳志高並未罷手，仍然糾集黨羽攻擊白水溪一帶的基督徒。1876年吉貝耍教會信徒溫旺與吳志高及同黨章興發生衝突。溫旺先遭兩人的黨徒挖眼，1877年4月更在牛稠埔頭遭吳志高殺害，同行的兒子溫木和向茂春被章興等人持刀砍傷。同年11月吳志高黨羽又燒毀吉貝耍教會，甘為霖請英國領事福雷特（A. Frater）出面，嘉義縣府在岩前公審，吳志高自知理屈，新建仙草埔岩前禮拜堂以賠償。在地方志和文史資料中，吳志高形象正面，對地方開發貢獻良多。然而他意識到教會的存在讓其在白水溪的地位受到挑戰，因教會已對當地居民產生影響；教會繼續擴張，超越他的掌控，勢必影響到他的霸主地位。遂以暴力威脅之手段，防止其勢力範圍內不受控制的教徒存在（王政文 2014：118-121；洪波浪、吳新榮 1980：100-101；賴永祥 1990：210）。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nThe government must, on the surface, uphold the right to propagate religion. However, in order to appease the anti-Christian sentiments of the populace and the gentry or to accommodate popular sentiment, it may cooperate. Moreover, some missionaries extend consular jurisdiction to their followers or intervene in cases related to their followers, challenging the prestige and authority of the government. For example, in 1876, after the conversion of teacher Li Xiandeng and his father Li Dongmian in Zhouli (now Luzhou District, New Taipei City), their relatives believed that they no longer participated in ancestral worship, thus forfeiting the right to the land left by their ancestors, i.e., encroaching on their land. When the two and other believers filed a complaint at the yamen, the yamen officials arrested the believers and rebuked them, saying, \"Abandoning one's ancestors and religion to follow those 'barbarians' is unfilial and disloyal.\" The believers were then shackled and imprisoned. They were later subjected to whipping and other tortures and were escorted to Taiwan Prefecture. The Li father and son were subsequently beheaded, their heads were placed in baskets labeled \"heads of converts,\" and they were brought back to Mengjia, where they were hung at the city gate as a warning. The remaining believers were detained again, and two of them died from torture and hunger. However, Fujian Governor Ding Rirang reported that the Li father and son were usually despised in their hometown and relied on religion for self-preservation. He also reported that when Magistrate Chen Xingju of Danshui Hall presided over the trial in Mengjia, Li Dongmian brandished a knife and caused public outrage, leading to his immediate arrest. However, George Leslie Mackay opposed the government's account and pointed out years later that officials and gentry admitted this was a scheme, and the believers were innocent victims. The government and gentry's purpose was to proclaim to the masses that those who joined the \"evil religion\" would eventually meet this fate. （馬偕2007：102；王政文2012：10-11；王政文2014：123；蔡蔚群2000：241；中央研究院近代史研究所1975：1510；林金水2003：226）。As the church's influence gradually spread to the grassroots level, the officials and gentry felt threatened and spread rumors, leading to the initiation of religious cases. On the one hand, some people relied on religion for self-preservation or exoneration, leading to a negative impression of \"relying on barbarian power\" (khò hoan-á-sè), allowing the officials and gentry to find opportunities, such as wars, to vent their emotions on the church or believers.\n\n\n官府。官府表面上必須維護傳教權利，但為了迎合、平息民眾和仕紳的反教情緒或因民氣可用而予以配合。而且，有些宣教士運用領事裁判權延伸到教民身上，或干涉與教民相關的案件，挑戰官府的威望和權威。例如1876年洲裡（今新北市蘆洲區）教師李先登與其父李東面在改宗後，宗族的族人認為他們不再參與宗族祭祀，因此已無權利繼續擁有祖先所遺留下來的土地，即佔去其田地。兩人與馬偕和其他教徒在衙門申告時，衙吏抓住眾教徒，官吏斥之「把自己的祖宗和宗教丟棄而去跟隨那個『番仔』，是不孝和不忠義的。」遂將教徒銬上鎖鍊並下監。之後受到鞭笞和其他酷刑，又被押解到台灣府，李氏父子先後遭斬首，頭顱被置於籃子，寫上「入教的人頭」，再帶回艋舺，懸掛於城門示眾，其餘教徒再被下獄拘留，其中兩人死於酷刑與飢餓。然而，福建巡撫丁日昌奏報李氏父子等人平素魚肉鄉里，因而恃教自保，又報告稱淡水廳同知陳星聚在艋舺審案時，李東面持刀鬨堂，引起仕紳公憤而當堂拘捕。然而馬偕反對官府上述陳述，並指多年後官紳承認此為計謀，教徒乃無辜受害，官府和仕紳的目的是為向群眾宣告凡入「邪教」者終有此命運（馬偕2007：102；王政文2012：10-11；王政文2014：123；蔡蔚群2000：241；中央研究院近代史研究所1975：1510；林金水2003：226）。當教會勢力逐漸蔓延至底層社會，官紳感到威脅，進而散佈謠言，發動教案。一方面某些民眾恃教自保或脫罪，出現「靠番仔勢」（khò hoan-á-sè）的負面印象，讓官紳找到諸如戰爭等機會，將情緒發洩在教會或教徒身上（王政文2014：126）。\n\n\nLocal temples serve as the focal point of folk beliefs and represent the primary network of unofficial local power. Through temples, local authorities establish power relations with the masses. Additionally, local temples serve as channels for communication between the government and society, while also serving as places for the government and local leadership to establish authority and social mobility. Local gentry who have achieved fame and local elites possessing official stamps often take on the responsibility of organizing rituals or celebrations. These gentry or elites compete for resources and support for temple rituals based on their local networks, accumulating social capital through activities such as rituals, donations or fundraising, temple construction, inscriptions, and plaques. In Taiwanese Han society, ethnic and religious relationships are closely intertwined, making it difficult to separate local ritual alliances from administrative alliances. Local landlords or heads of cultivation areas include tenant farmers in a shared system of communal rituals, forming mechanisms for regional alliance groups. The case of Wu Zhigao illustrates how he leveraged participation in local construction and temple activities to establish local power. Wu Zhigao and other anti-Christian gentry and local elites are embedded in temple networks, mutually influencing each other. Although it cannot be conclusively stated that temples are direct bases for anti-Christian forces, these anti-Christian individuals use their relationships with temples to gain resources and support against Christianity. In contrast to temples, churches and missionaries symbolize Western forces opposed to local traditional power and pose challenges to local traditional power. The cases of Wen Wang and Li Dongmian's persecution clearly reflect the rejection of Christianity by local power, illustrating how those in positions of authority attempt to maintain the existing order dominated by folk beliefs in the social context (Wang Zhengwen 2014: 123-124).\n\n\n地方廟宇。宮廟是民間信仰的祭祀中心，亦為地方勢力非官方主要網絡，地方勢力亦透過廟宇達成與群眾之間的權力關係。此外，地方廟宇是政權與社會之間溝通意見的管道，同時扮演政府和地方領導階層建立權威與社會流動的場所。取得功名的地方仕紳等鄉治代理者以及領有官方牌戳的地方菁英，往往也擔負舉辦祭祀或慶典之責。仕紳或菁英按其地方的關係網絡爭取廟宇舉辦祭祀的資源和支持，再透過祭祀活動、捐款或募款、建廟、題字、獻匾等善行累積社會資本。在台灣漢人社會族群和宗教關係密切，地方的祭祀聯庄和行政聯庄幾乎難以分割，地方墾首或地主在共同的拓墾地區內，將佃戶納入共同祭典的體系中，成為地區聯庄組合的機制。由吳志高的案例可見，他藉參與地方建設和廟宇活動，建立地方勢力。吳志高和其他反教仕紳、地方菁英鑲嵌在廟宇網絡關係中，或可說互為表裡，雖然不能斷言廟宇是反教勢力的直接基地，但這些反教人士卻是藉著與廟宇的關係建立勢力，因而獲得反教的人力和聲量資源。相對於廟宇而言，教堂及宣教士在宗教和社會意義上象徵與之對立的西方勢力，且對地方傳統勢力而言也是挑戰。從溫旺和李東面遭害的案例，即明顯反映地方勢力對基督教的排斥，也說明社會脈絡中有權者為維護既有勢力而企圖穩住以民間信仰為主的既有秩序（王政文2014：123-124）。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nThe Mwatau Massacre (麻豆事件, 1895) is related to the Sino-Japanese War and the Yì Wèi Anti-Japanese Movement. Local militia in Yunlin Douliu and Chiayi heard rumors that missionaries were acting as guides for the Japanese army. Enraged by this, they attacked churches in both areas. Churches in Shanlun, Dounan, and other places were also destroyed by angry mobs, and believers were besieged. In Damao (modern-day Jia Yi), a believer named Lin Tianding, along with two seekers and one Catholic, were falsely accused of assisting the Japanese army and were publicly executed by decapitation.\n\n\nOn October 9th, Japanese troops captured Chiayi, causing the militia to retreat to the Tainan area. The defeated militia informed the villagers of Mwatau in Tainan about the events near Chiayi, inciting them to take similar action. The villagers had long harbored resentment towards local missionaries, forcing them to flee to the mountains and leading to wanted posters being put up seeking information on their whereabouts. On October 14th, 20 Christians in Mwatau were killed for refusing to join the militia, falsely accused of colluding with the Japanese. According to the account of Reverend Barclay, 19 men and women were murdered by the mob, of which 4 were not Christians. The October edition of the \"Taiwan Prefectural City Church News\" listed the names of 21 deceased individuals, but two were later found to be alive and the list was corrected.\n\n\nAfter investigations, it was found that Liu Yongfu, a member of the Black Flag Army, was the mastermind behind the incident. He even wrote to the Tainan Prefecture and posted notices around the city urging the extermination of Christians to prevent future trouble.\n\n\nAfter Japan established its rule in Taiwan, relatives of the victims filed lawsuits seeking compensation. However, the Japanese authorities did not handle the matter properly, citing that the incident occurred before their formal rule over Taiwan. The Mwatau Incident not only stirred up anti-foreign sentiments in neighboring cities but also spread rumors in eastern churches about Christians colluding with the Japanese, leading to attacks on churches and believers.\n\n\nChristian communities not only faced incitement from militia forces but also suffered from false accusations by the Japanese army after they occupied various parts of Taiwan. Many Christians were arrested, detained, tortured, and killed, while churches in the northern regions were occupied by the Japanese army. The total number of killed and missing believers amounted to 735. Southern churches like the Dagou Church were also destroyed or burnt down by the Japanese army, leading the Tainan Missionary Association to seek compensation from the Japanese government.\n\n\n麻豆事件（Mwatau Massacre, 1895）。與甲午戰爭和乙未抗日運動有關，雲林斗六和嘉義地方義軍聽到傳聞宣教士為日軍作嚮導，因此憤而襲擊兩地教堂，沙崙、斗南等地教堂也被當地憤怒群眾搗毀，信徒遭到圍攻。打貓（今嘉義民雄）一名信徒林添丁和兩名慕道者、一名天主教徒四人被誣陷為協助日軍，遭到斬首示眾。日軍10月9日攻陷嘉義，義軍撤往台南地區。敗逃的義軍告知台南麻豆村民嘉義附近的事件，慫恿其起而效尤。村民早已仇視當地傳道人，迫使其躲進山區，以致村中張貼告示懸賞徵求通報其下落。10月14日，麻豆20名基督徒因不願參加義軍，被誣指暗通日軍而遭殺害，據巴克禮的說法，有19名男女被暴徒謀殺，其中4人不是基督徒，10月份128卷《台灣府城教會報》列出死者21人之名，但有兩人未死，後予以更正。經事後調查，事件主謀是劉永福黑旗軍部屬，其人甚至馳函台南府城並在城內四處張貼告示煽動剿滅基督徒以防後患（王政文2014：130-131；巴克禮2022：226-230）。日本在台統治確立後，受害者親屬提起告訴，要求賠償，但是日本政權似以此事件發生於其正式治台之前為由，並未妥善處理。麻豆事件不但激起鄰近的府城排外情緒，東部教會亦流傳基督徒與日本人勾結的傳言，而使教會和信徒受到攻擊（巴克禮2022：228）。基督徒不僅遭義軍煽動台人攻擊，日軍攻陷台灣各地後，又誣陷基督徒唆使暴徒反抗日軍，不少基督徒被捕、拘留、虐待、殘殺，禮拜堂被佔用，北部教會有20間禮拜堂被日軍佔用，信徒被殺和失蹤者共計735名（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會 1965：96）。而南部教會如打狗教會也被日軍破壞甚至焚燬，台南教士會因此向日本政府求償（甘為霖2004[1910]：605）。 ",
