The announcement required representatives from various sectors in Taiwan, including representatives of all religious sects, to attend the rituals held at the Taiwan Shrine (Wen Guoliang 2001: 198-199; Wen Guoliang 2000: 326-327).\n\n「即裕仁皇太子，後來之昭和天皇，於大正13年（1924年）1月26日與久邇宮邦彦王長女良子舉行結婚典禮，規定在台各界包括宗教各宗派總代表出席在臺灣神社的祭祀事宜（溫國良2001：198-199；溫國良2000：326-327）。\n\nOrdinance No. 74 on the Salary Regulations for Priests of Shrines Below Prefectural Shrines [Taisho 13, September 9] [A government order on the rules for stipends for clergy at shrines below the county level]\n\n縣社以下神社神職俸給規則府令案——府令第七十四號[縣社以下神社神職人員俸給規則府令案] 【大正13年9月9日】 \n\n\n**Salary Regulations for Priests of Shrines Below Prefectural Shrines**\n\n「縣社以下神社神職人員俸給規則\n\n\n**Article 1:** The salaries of priests of shrines below the prefectural level shall be paid by the shrine in accordance with the attached schedule.\n\n第一條 縣社以下神社神職人員之俸給應依附表由神社支給之。\n\n\n**Article 2:** Shrine priests (Shashi) and assistant priests (Shasho) shall not receive salary increases for less than one year of service in each rank, except for those receiving salaries of sixth rank or below.\n\n第二條 社司、社掌每級在職未滿一年以上，不得增給；但領六級俸以下者，不在此限。 \n\n\n**Article 3:** Shrine priests and assistant priests who have served for more than five years in one rank with outstanding performance may receive a special allowance of up to fifty yen per month.\n\n第三條 社司、社掌在職五年以上，職內領一級俸而成績優良者，得特別加給月額五十圓以內。\n\n\n**Article 4:** For shrine priests and assistant priests with salaries below the sixth rank, an appropriate amount may be set and paid regardless of rank; however, it shall not be less than the minimum salary amount set for each position.\n\n第四條 以社司、社掌之俸給在六級俸以下者為限，可不限級俸，訂定適當之金額支給之；但不得給與各所所定之最低俸給額。\n\n\n**Article 5:** In shrines with more than two assistant priests, some may be designated as honorary positions.

They therefore established the \"Taiwan Parliament Establishment Alliance\" and sought to apply for association registration with the police department. However, this application was rejected based on Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the \"Public Security Police Law\" announced on February 2 of the same year. Chiang Wei-shui moved the headquarters to Tokyo, with Lin Cheng-lu as the initiator, and applied for association registration with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The \"Taiwan Parliament Establishment Alliance,\" which had been banned in Taipei, was approved for establishment in Tokyo. \n\n1923年1月，蔣渭水等臺灣文化協會中的非左派人士感到臺灣議會設置請願運動的發展已見瓶頸，於是改立「臺灣議會期成同盟會」，擬向警察署提出結社申請。但這項申請被同年2月2日公布的「治安警察法」第八條第一項為由駁回。蔣渭水將總部移至東京，以林呈祿為發起人，向東京警察署提出結社申請，在台北被禁止的「臺灣議會期成同盟會」獲准成立。\n\nThis move angered the Police Department of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, and on December 16 of the same year, under the direction of Taipei District Court Prosecutor Miyoshi Ichihachi, Chiang Wei-shui and 49 others were prosecuted again under Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the \"Public Security Police Law.\" The following August, all were acquitted, but Chiang Wei-shui, Cai Peihuo, Chen Fengyuan, Cai Huiru, and 10 others were indicted again. Among them, Cai Peihuo was a Christian who had met Pastor Uemura Masahisa in 1917 and was baptized in 1920, joining Uemura's Fujimicho Church of the Japanese Christian Church. Uemura's connections allowed Cai to engage with Japanese political figures, and many of the \"introducing parliamentarians\" supporting the petition movement for the establishment of a Taiwanese parliament were connected through Uemura. Uemura not only lent the church for political speeches by Taiwanese but also introduced Lin Hsien-tang and Cai Peihuo to political figures.\n\n但此舉激怒臺灣總督府警務局，遂於同年12月16日在台北地方法院檢察官三好一八指揮下，再以「治安警察法」第八條第二項將蔣渭水在內49人檢舉起訴。隔年8月，全體人員獲判無罪，但蔣渭水、蔡培火、陳逢源、蔡惠如等14人再度被起訴。其中蔡培火是基督徒，他在1917年認識植村正久牧師，在1920年受洗，加入植村主持的日本基督教會富士見町教會，也因為植村的人脈，使他得以接觸日本政界人士，蔡培火所投入議會設置請願運動在日本表達支持的「介紹議員」大部分即是透過植村的關係。植村不但出借教會供臺灣人政治演講，更介紹林獻堂、蔡培火會晤政要。\n\nOn October 29, 1924, the aforementioned 14 individuals were convicted by the Taipei District Court of violating Article 23, Paragraph 2 of the \"Public Security Police Law.\" Cai Peihuo was sentenced to five months in prison but was actually sentenced to four months. He was imprisoned on February 21, 1925, and released on May 10. Among the 14, Han Shih-chuan later became a Christian in 1930, and he was only fined 100 yen at that time (Shi Ming 2014: 513, 517; Suehiro Shinya 2012: 257; Wang Zhaowen 2009: 94, 98-99; Chou Wan-yao 2011: 17-18).\n\n1924年10月29日，上述14人經台北地方法院判決，確定違反「治安警察法」第二十三條第二項，而被判有罪。蔡培火被求刑五個月，但被判四個月，1925年2月21日入監，5月10日出獄。14人當中韓石泉而後在1930年也成為基督徒，而他當時僅被判罰金百元（史明2014：513、517；末光欣也2012：257；王昭文2009：94、98-99；周婉窈2011：17-18）。 \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\n**Conflicts Between the Presbyterian Church and the Holy Church and True Jesus Church**\n\n長老教會與聖教會和真耶穌教會的衝突。\n\nDuring the Japanese colonial period, Taiwanese society did not exhibit significant hostility towards Christianity, and the anti-Christian movement in China did not directly impact Taiwan. However, the arrival of the Holy Church and True Jesus Church in Taiwan in the 1920s led to conflicts with the Presbyterian Church. The most sensitive issue, aside from doctrinal differences, was the \"sheep stealing\" problem. Lai Ren-sheng, who once converted from the Presbyterian Church to the Holy Church, criticized the True Jesus Church and the Holy Church. He identified three common issues with these two churches: 1. Evangelizing to existing believers, causing confusion in their faith; 2. Re-baptizing those who were already believers; 3. Emphasizing \"divine healing\" as a condition for salvation. All three issues pointed to \"sheep stealing.\" Lai Ren-sheng also criticized the internal splits within the two denominations from the perspective of church unity. He criticized the True Jesus Church for splitting into factions such as \"Shin'yaso Kyokai\" and \"Makoto Yasokureja,\" which were hostile to each other. He also criticized the Holy Church for splitting into the \"Bishop faction\" supporting Chuta Nakata and the \"Committee faction\" supporting Shuji Kurata, particularly condemning Chuta Nakata as an extremist who supported nationalism and made false predictions about the second coming of Jesus. Lai Ren-sheng believed that denominations should cooperate and coexist but also asserted that the Presbyterian Church was the most stable and peaceful denomination (Lai Ren-sheng, October 1934: 3-4; November 1934: 5-6).\n\n日治時代的臺灣社會對基督教並無明顯敵意，中國的非基運動也無直接衝擊臺灣。然而，1920年代聖教會和真耶穌教會的入台，卻與長老教會發生衝突，除了教義方面，最敏感的莫過於「搶羊」。曾一度從長老教會轉信聖教會的賴仁聲曾對真耶穌教會、聖教會甚至發出批評，並指出這兩個教會有三項共同問題：1. 向已是信徒者傳教，混亂他人信仰；2.為已信者重新洗禮；3.重視「神聖醫治」，並視為得到救恩的條件。三項問題均指向「搶羊」。賴仁聲同時從教會合一的角度抨擊兩個教派的內部分裂問題。他批評真耶穌教會在台分出「シインヤソキヤウクヮイ」、「マコトヤソェクレヂヤ」等分支，且互相敵對；也批評聖教會分出支持中田重治的「監督派」以及支持車田秋次的「委員派」，尤其批評與中田重治為極端派，指其支持愛國主義，又錯誤預測耶穌將於某年某日再臨。賴仁聲認為教派之間應該合作、共存，但同時也主張長老教會是最為穩健、平和的宗派（賴仁聲 1934.10：3-4；賴仁聲 1934.11：5-6）。\n\nCompared to the Holy Church, the Presbyterian Church's criticism of the True Jesus Church was more severe. In the early years of the True Jesus Church in Taiwan, the \"Taiwan Church News\" published several critical articles in 1926, 1927, and 1929, such as \"My View on the True Jesus Church,\" \"Barnabas Chang Deceives People,\" \"Barnabas Chang's Methods,\" and \"Wang Jianxian,\" pointing out the doctrinal errors of the church and its leader, Barnabas Chang. These articles included personal attacks, accusing them of cheating people out of money and using witchcraft to harm others (Wu Xueming 2012: 119-120). These articles showed that the Presbyterian Church took the \"sheep stealing\" issue of the True Jesus Church very seriously.\n\n相較於聖教會，長老教會對真耶穌教會的抨擊更為嚴厲，在真耶穌教會入台初期，1926、1927、1929年的《臺灣教會報》更曾刊登數篇文章如〈真耶穌教的我見〉、〈張巴拿巴迷惑人〉、〈張巴拿巴的手段〉、〈王見現〉予以批判，指出該會和領袖張巴拿巴所傳教義錯誤，也涉及人身攻擊，包括騙人錢財、以巫術害人（吳學明2012：119-120）。前述文章顯示長老教會嚴正看待真耶穌教會「搶羊」問題。\n\nOn the other hand, figures like Huang Chengcong from the True Jesus Church criticized the Presbyterian Church for valuing those with power or wealth and trying to please the British. They also criticized the Presbyterian Church for \"resisting the true way\" and lacking the Holy Spirit, thereby justifying their evangelization efforts among Presbyterian Church members and encouraging conversion (Huang Elisha 1956: 33-35).\n\n而真耶穌教會方，如黃呈聰則批評長老教會內部看重有權勢或財富者、討英國人歡喜，並從教義層面指其「抗拒真道」、沒有聖靈，因此合理化其向長老教會信徒傳教並望改宗的踐行（黃以利沙1956：33-35）。 \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nAfter 1895, Taiwan became a Japanese colony. However, it wasn't until 1919, following the revision of the judicial system, that the Governor-General of Taiwan demanded China transfer the judicial jurisdiction of Taiwan nationals across the strait to Taiwan. According to Law No. 25 of 1921, after preliminary trials by Japanese consulate officials stationed in Fujian, Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces in southern China, the judicial authority over Taiwanese criminals was transferred to the Taipei District Court under the Governor-General of Taiwan (Matsuhiro Kinya 2012: 260; Wang Shiqing 1961: 110).\n\n1895年以後，臺灣成為日本殖民地。不過，時至1919年，臺灣總督府順著司法制度的修訂，才要求中國把海峽對岸臺灣籍人民的司法裁判權歸屬臺灣。1921年依法律第二十五號規定，先經駐福建、廣東、雲南的中國南部各省的日本領事館官員預審裁判後，臺灣籍犯罪者的裁判權由臺灣總督府台北地方法院管轄（末光欣也2012：260；王世慶1961：110）。\n\n\nAt that time, Taiwan was politically and geographically associated with Korea and Manchuria (Northeast China). Among them, Taiwan and China had a special and deep relationship, with China becoming an important overseas development area for Taiwanese people. Japan targeted China for expansion and aggression, using medical services to enter China as a means of non-military expansion. Hence, Japan sent Taiwanese doctors to China to implement this goal of medical expansion. For example, between 1918 and 1924, the Governor-General's Office established Pok Oi Hospitals in Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and Shantou. These hospitals' staff comprised individuals from Japan, Taiwan, and China. The establishment of Pok Oi Hospitals posed a threat to the local medical ecosystem, leading to opposition from doctors within the British and American Christian medical systems (Chen Lihang 2012: 29).\n\n此外，當時臺灣與韓國、滿州（中國東北）置於同一政治地緣關係。其中以中國與臺灣人民具有特殊且深厚的關係，中國也成臺灣人重要的海外發展地；而日本當時以中國為擴張和侵略的目標，以醫療進入中國一度是日本進行非武力擴張的媒介，因此也派遣臺灣人醫師到中國落實其以醫療在中國進行擴張的目標。例如1918-1924年間總督府在福州、廣州、汕頭成立博愛會醫院，各地博愛會成員以日、台、中三方人士組成。博愛會醫院的成立為當地醫療生態造成威脅，英美基督教醫療體系的醫師因而發起反對聲浪（陳力航2012：29）。\n\nTo achieve the aforementioned goals, the Governor-General of Taiwan encouraged Taiwanese doctors to work in China by offering higher salaries. After the establishment of Pok Oi Hospitals across South China, many Taiwanese doctors took up positions there. Some Taiwanese doctors also set up their own practices in South China. Among the Taiwanese doctors practicing in China, some were Christians. Lee Mok (Lee Bing-wen), who graduated from Tainan Presbyterian Middle School, worked as an assistant at Gangshan Jian'an Hospital, established by Gao Zaizhu, son of Gao Zhang. His wife, Gao Xiuli, was the third daughter of Gao Zhang and sister of Gao Zaizhu. In 1925, Lee obtained his medical practice qualification and in 1929 went to Xiamen to manage Fuan Hospital. He also served as the school doctor for Xiamen Xuying Academy, Zhonghua Elementary School, and Quanmin New Daily Newspaper. Being a Christian, he actively participated in local church activities (Chen Lihang 2012: 40, 105).\n\n臺灣總督府基於前述目的，以提高薪資的方式鼓勵臺灣醫師到中國任職，博愛會在華南各地成立後，許多人即到此任職。但也有一些臺灣醫師在華南自行開業。前往中國行醫的臺灣醫師中，也有部分基督徒，李墨（李秉文）在台南長老教中學畢業後，在高長之子高再祝開設的岡山建安醫院擔任助手，其妻高秀理是高長三女，是高再祝之妹。1925年取得醫師開業資格，1929年西渡廈門經營扶安醫院，並在廈門旭瀛書院校醫、中華小學校校醫、全閩新日報社社醫。由於是基督徒，也積極參與當地教會活動（陳力航2012：40，105）。\n\n\nFrom the beginning of Japanese rule in Taiwan until the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japan maintained good relations with Western countries, primarily those with a Christian influence. Countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States had consulates in Taiwan, fostering close and harmonious interactions. Foreigners were also allowed to establish corporations and obtain land ownership. In September 1925, Shinichi Mori, the head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, announced in a reply to the British Consul in Tamsui, P.D. Butler, that foreigners in Taiwan could apply for corporate status under Japanese law, and that there were no current regulations prohibiting corporations from owning land. This followed the implementation of the \"Foreign Land Law\" (Law No. 42) in April of the same year.\n\n從開始領台至太平洋戰爭爆發前，日本與基督教為主的西方國家關係尚佳，英美等國均派任領事駐台，互動密切且融洽，外國人也可設立法人並取得土地所有權。1925年9月，臺灣總督府外事股長森新一在回覆駐淡水英國領事蒲脫勒（P.D. Bulter）時宣布，在臺灣之外國人得依照日本法律申請法人，且現行法規並無禁止法人擁有土地，同年4月以法律四十二號公布之「外國人土地法」將付諸實行。\n\n\nIn June 1923, the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, through Executive Order No. 54, announced the \"Regulations on Mutual Recognition of Ship Tonnage\" agreed upon by the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom. It stipulated that, after 1895, British ships holding tonnage measurement certificates issued by relevant British authorities would not need to measure their tonnage at Taiwan ports. The tonnage recorded on these certificates would be recognized as equivalent to that of Japanese ships. During the 1920s and 1930s, British Embassy personnel in Japan and Far East consuls visited Taiwan several times.\n\n1923年6月，臺灣總督府以府令五十四號公布日英兩國政府商訂之「關於船舶搭載量互認之規約」，謂1895年後，持有英國相關機關發給之船舶搭載量測量證明書之英國船舶，在臺灣各港口不需測量其搭載量，並承認其證明書記載之噸數與同樣之日本船舶噸數相同。1920年-1930年這段期間內，駐日的英國使館人員、遠東領事也數次訪台。\n\nAdditionally, during this period, various foreign warships docked at Taiwanese ports such as Keelung and Kaohsiung. For instance, in 1928, four British warships, including the HMS Bulrush, and the French Far East Fleet's Jules Michelet, visited Taiwan. In 1929, the Italian warship RM Magenta docked, and in 1930, the British warships HMS Colombo and HMS Marazion visited. These interactions indicate that the relationship between the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan and predominantly Christian Western countries was normal and positive at that time (Wang Shiqing 1961: 110-114).\n\n此外，這段期間也有各國軍艦停靠臺灣基隆和高雄等各港，例如1928年有英國布爾斯號等四艘軍艦、法國遠東艦隊朱爾密細愛勒號；1929年有義大利軍艦莫熱雅號；1930年有英國軍艦剛夫拉哇號和馬拉治翁號。由前述的往來關係可見，當時臺灣總督府與基督教為主的西方國家關係正常且良好（王世慶1961：110-114）。\n\n\nAfter Japan's takeover of Taiwan, there were two phases of armed resistance against Japanese rule: 1895-1902 and 1907-1915. By 1920, anti-Japanese actions had shifted towards non-violent resistance initiated by intellectuals, focusing on cultural enlightenment and the struggle for autonomy. From the 1910s, Taiwanese students studying in Japan and China began forming various organizations advocating for liberation. Most Taiwanese students in Tokyo were inclined towards the principle of national self-determination that emerged during World War I. Three major entities, *Taiwan Youth*, the \"Taiwan Parliament Petition Movement,\" and the \"Taiwan Cultural Association,\" became the primary forces advocating for self-determination.\n\n日本領台之後，臺灣曾有兩個階段的武裝抗日：1895-1902、1907-1915。1920年的抗日行動開始轉向由知識份子發起在文化啟蒙、爭取自治方面的非武力抵抗途徑。從1910年代起，在日本和中國的臺灣留學生就已相繼成立各種社團鼓吹解放，其中，東京大部分的臺灣留學生傾向一戰時期民族自決的路線，由其創設的《臺灣青年》、「臺灣議會設置請願運動」、「臺灣文化協會」三大系統是為自決派的主要力量。\n\n\nIn 1920, the leaders of the Tokyo Taiwan Youth Association made the abolition of the \"Law 63\" their central mission for national self-determination. In 1921, Lin Hsien-tang and others submitted a \"Petition for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament.\" However, the following year, the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan proposed extending the \"Law 63,\" which was passed by the Japanese Diet and continued to be enforced in Taiwan as \"Law No. 3.\" The petition for establishing a parliament was rejected. This result heightened the determination of young intellectuals to seek equality and autonomy. From 1921 to 1934, they submitted 15 petitions, all of which were unsuccessful.\n\n1920年，東京臺灣青年會諸幹部即把要求廢除「六三法」作為民族自決中心任務，並在1921年由林獻堂等人提出「臺灣議會設置請願申請書」，然而隔年臺灣總督府提出延長「六三法」的議案在日本國會通過，以「法律第三號」繼續在臺灣施行；而議會設置請願卻遭否決。此結果讓青年知識份子尋求平權、自治的決心更為高漲，從1921-1934提出15次的請願，但均未果。\n\nShi Ming divides the petition efforts into three periods:\n\n1. **Unified Front Era**: During this time, Taiwanese students in Tokyo, within Taiwan, and in China all supported the petitions in unity.\n\n2. **Era of Divided Fronts**: In 1927, the Taiwan Cultural Association and the Taiwan Youth Association in Japan were taken over by leftist factions advocating for socialist revolution. The right-wing of the Taiwan Cultural Association subsequently established the \"Taiwan Parliament Formation Alliance\" in 1923 and the \"Taiwan People's Party\" in 1927, adhering to the nationalist movement seeking autonomy.\n\n3. **Era of Decline**: There was internal conflict within the Taiwan People's Party between the leftist faction led by Chiang Wei-shui and the rightist faction led by Tsai Pei-huo.\n\n史明將請願分為三個時期：1.統一戰線時代。東京、島內、中國的臺灣留學生各派均為支持請願而求得一致；2. 戰線分裂時代。1927年島內臺灣文化協會和日本臺灣青年會皆由左派取得主導權，支持社會主義革命；臺灣文化協會的右派則另外先後在1923年成立「臺灣議會期成同盟會」，1927年成立「臺灣民眾黨」，固守尋求自治的民族運動路線；3. 沒落時代。臺灣民眾黨的蔣渭水派（左派）和蔡培火派（右派）對立。\n\n\nDespite the petitions being rejected, some Japanese politicians and scholars expressed support. In response to the political backlash from Taiwanese and their demand for political participation, the Governor-General's Office established the \"Taiwan Governor-General's Advisory Council\" in 1921. This council included nine Taiwanese members out of 25. However, the council was merely an advisory body providing opinions on bills and important matters, often under official guidance, which was significantly misaligned with the demands of the Taiwanese people (Shi Ming 2014: 468-510; Matsuhiro Kinya 2012: 256-260; Jian Houcong 2002: 608; Chou Wan-Yao 2011: 9-30).\n\n雖然請願運動被駁回，但日本有若干政治家、學者表達支持。此外，為因應臺灣人的政治反彈以及要求參政權的自治動向，總督府在1921年設置「臺灣總督府評議會」，允許於25名會員中有9名臺灣人參加。然而評議會在法案和重要事項方面只是陳述參考意見的諮詢機關，許多討論是在官方主導下完成，與臺灣人的訴求存在極大落差（史明2014：468-510；末光欣也2012：256-260；簡後聰2002：608；周婉窈2011：9-30）。 ",
