He graduated from Changhua First Public School in 1903 and from the National Language School of the Governor-General of Taiwan in 1907. From 1918 to 1923, he studied political economy at Waseda University in Japan. Huang actively participated in various social movements and was involved in the associations of Taiwanese students in Japan during his studies. In 1919, he joined the \"Enlightenment Society,\" which was reorganized into the \"New People's Society\" the following year, where he was elected as an officer. In 1921, he served as the General Affairs Officer of the \"Taiwan Youth Association\" and the General Affairs Director of the Tokyo headquarters of the \"Taiwan Magazine Company,\" the publishing organization for the association's magazine \"Taiwan Youth,\" which supported the petition movement for establishing the Taiwan Parliament.\n\n\n黃呈聰（1886.3.25-1963.7.20），字劍如，教名黃以利沙。社會運動者、商人、真耶穌教會在台奠基性角色之領袖。1903年彰化第一公學校畢業，1907年畢業於臺灣總督府國語學校，1918年至1923年赴日就讀早稻田大學政治經濟科。黃呈聰積極投身各項社會運動，在日求學期間活躍於台灣留日學生的結社活動，1919年加入「啟發會」，隔年啟發會改組為「新民會」，獲選為幹事，1921年任「臺灣青年會」總務幹事以及其機關刊物《台灣青年》的發行機構「臺灣雜誌社」東京本社總務主任，該組織乃支援臺灣議會設置請願運動。\n\n\nIn 1920, he was appointed the first village head of Xianxi Village in Taichung Prefecture. However, the following year, he co-signed a proposal with other village heads from Changhua, recommending to Governor-General Den Kenjiro to abolish the collective punishment system. Huang also expressed concerns about the social and economic issues under colonial rule in Taiwan and provided opinions on the cultural identity and future of Taiwan. Due to his active political involvement, his family was implicated, and his father, Huang Xiu, moved the entire family to Zhangzhou, Fujian (Deng Huien 2012: 17-37; Huang Songxian 2014: 47-54).\n\n1920年他被任命為台中州線西庄首任庄長，但隔年與彰化其他街庄長聯名，向總督田健次郎建議廢除實行連坐的保甲制度。此外，他也關心殖民統治下台灣社會、經濟問題，並對台灣文化定位以及台灣前途提出意見。由於黃呈聰積極參與政治，黃家人受到牽連，其父黃秀兩舉家遷至福建漳州（鄧慧恩2012：17-37；黃頌顯2014：47-54）。\n\n\nThe Huang family originally had a Presbyterian background, but during their time in China, Huang Chengchao converted to the True Jesus Church, influencing Huang Chengcong to also join the faith. In 1926, Huang Chengcong led eight people, including preachers from the church and Taiwanese who had converted in Fujian, to Taiwan to evangelize, resulting in the establishment of three churches. After converting to the True Jesus Church, Huang Chengcong frequently traveled between China and Taiwan, participated in the church's Nanjing Theological Seminary, and assisted with the 'Holy Spirit Times' newspaper. The sixth general assembly initiated a review of the church's origins, questioning the founding narrative of Zhang Barnabas, with Huang Chengcong being a key figure (Ye Xianqin, Cai Yanren 2020: 47).\n\n\n黃家原先為長老教會背景，但在中國期間，其弟黃呈超接受真耶穌教會信仰，黃呈聰受其影響而歸信。1926年黃呈聰率領該會傳道者以及在福建已歸信該會的台人加其共八人來台傳道，此行即建立三間教會。黃呈聰歸信真耶穌教會後不時往來兩岸，參加該會南京神學會，並曾協助《聖靈報》報務。第六次大會發起審查該會起源，對張巴拿巴的創會敘事提出質疑，黃呈聰亦為關鍵人物（葉先秦、蔡彥仁 2020：47）。\n\nFrom an external perspective, Huang Chengcong's contribution lies in promoting reform through participation in social and political movements, advocating a moderate cultural resistance to Japanese rule. Wakabayashi Masahiro pointed out that Huang Chengcong was a 'waiting faction' anti-Japanese activist of the local landlord bourgeoisie. The 'waiting faction' did not engage in direct combat with Japan but used modern knowledge to contribute to the construction of the 'motherland' (China), believing that once the 'motherland' became strong, the Taiwanese people would be liberated. This viewpoint expressed empathy for the negative situation in China at the time, temporarily setting aside expectations and waiting for changes in the circumstances (Wakabayashi Masahiro 1987: 41). From a religious perspective, he was a foundational figure in the evangelism of the True Jesus Church in Taiwan, playing significant roles in both its organization and theology.\n\n就教外角度而言，黃呈聰的貢獻在於藉著參與社會和政治運動推動改革，為溫和的文化抗日路線。若林正丈指出，黃呈聰是本地地主資產階級的「待機派」抗日份子，待機派意即不與日本直接戰鬥，而是用所學近代知識為「祖國」（中國）的建設效力，待「祖國」強大後，臺灣人才能得到解救。這種觀點對當時中國局勢的負面情況表示同理，暫時不予期待，等待時局變化（若林正丈1987：41）。就宗教角度而言，他是真耶穌教會在台傳教奠基者，在組織和神學上兼有之。\n\n\nIn 1949, due to the political situation, the True Jesus Church in Taiwan and mainland China lost contact. The True Jesus Church in Taiwan then took on a central and headquarters role, a foundational work significantly attributed to Huang Chengcong. He was also a key figure in the introduction of the True Jesus Church to Japan. For him, the establishment of the True Jesus Church by Chinese people was actually part of a national movement, symbolizing the restoration of the true faith in China. This meant that China would become the new center of global Christianity. He continued his spiritual longing for China through religious means (Deng Huien 2012: 44).\n\n\n1949年兩岸真耶穌教會因政治局勢失聯，台灣真耶穌教會得以隨即扮演中樞、總部角色，黃呈聰的奠基工作不可忽視。他也是真耶穌教會得以傳入日本的重要人物。而實際上，對其而言，中國人創立的真耶穌教會實為民族運動的一環，意即相信該會的創立象徵真道恢復於中國，因此中國成為世界基督教的新中心，他以宗教的方式延續心靈對中國的嚮往（鄧慧恩2012：44）。\n\nInosuke Inoue (1882.9.2-1966.6.20), whose Chinese name is Gao Tianming. Physician, evangelist, and early mountain evangelist in Taiwan. In 1900, he studied at the Evening Department of Daeseong Gakukan, and from 1905 to 1907, he studied at the Holy Book School of the Oriental Missionary Society. His father was killed by the Taroko aborigines in the Hualien Mountains of Taiwan in 1906. After a religious experience, he realized that \"the best way to get revenge is to use love to overcome evil\", and he determined to go to Taiwan to preach to the aborigines. However, the Japanese government's \"Libo Policy\" at that time was planning to \"Shintoize\" the religious beliefs of the indigenous peoples, and therefore prohibited any missionaries from entering the indigenous tribes to preach Christianity. Inoue decided to use medical treatment as a cover to facilitate his missionary work, so he entered Izu Toda Hoxuedo Hospital in 1910 to engage in medical research and internship. He obtained a medical certificate in 1911, arrived in Taiwan in the same year, and entered the Hsinchu Galapai tribe as a mountain entrustment. Returned home due to illness.\n\n\n井上伊之助（Inosuke Inoue, 1882.9.2-1966.6.20），漢名高天命。醫師、傳道者，台灣早期進行山地傳道者。1900年就讀大成學館夜間部，1905年至1907年就讀東洋宣教會聖書學院，。其父1906年在台灣花蓮山區被太魯閣族原住民殺害，後在一宗教經驗中體悟「最好的報復方式，就是用愛勝過惡」，遂立志到台灣向原住民宣教。惟當時日本政府的「理蕃政策」，正計畫將原住民的宗教信仰「神道化」，因此禁止任何傳道者進入原住民部落傳基督教。井上決定以醫療方式為掩護以利傳教，故此1910年入伊豆戶田寶血堂醫院從事醫學研究和實習，1911年取得醫師證，同年抵台，以山地囑託身份進入新竹加拉排部落，後因病回國。\n\nIn 1922, he returned to Taiwan and was appointed as a missionary for the Japanese Christian Church in Hsinchu City. He also went on itinerant missions in the mountain areas, entering indigenous tribes again in 1926 and 1931 (Inoue Inosuke 2016: 42-45, 324-328). During his time in Taiwan, Inoue continuously advocated for the evangelization and education of the indigenous people. For example, at the joint prayer meetings in Taipei in December 1923 and January 1924, he not only reaffirmed that he had come for the indigenous people but also argued that since the Japanese were good at imitation, they should learn from other countries' efforts to evangelize foreigners and different races. He criticized the fact that, despite Japan having several colonies at the time, Japanese Christians had never devised a plan to evangelize the people in those colonies (Inoue Inosuke 2016: 149-152).\n\n\n1922年再度來台，被任命為新竹市日本基督教會傳道，並前往山地巡迴傳道，1926年、1931年再次進入原住民部落（井上伊之助2016：42-45、324-328）。井上在台期間不斷呼籲以傳教教化原住民，例如在1923年12月和1924年1月的台北聯合祈禱會上，他不但重申自己乃為原住民而來，且主張日本人既然善於模仿，就應學習他國向外國人和不同種族傳教，並斥責日本今時已有幾處殖民地，日本基督徒卻不曾擬定向其人民傳道的計畫（井上伊之助2016：149-152）。\n\n\nAfter the war, he continued to stay in Taiwan until returning to Japan in 1947, where he worked as a university lecturer and engaged in missionary activities. Inoue Inosuke is known as the \"Father of Medical Care and Missionary Work for Taiwan's Indigenous People.\" His work \"Notes on the Savages\" serves as a primary resource for the study of indigenous people, especially valuable as an ethnographic account that documents the headhunting culture. It also reflects his differing views on Japan's policies towards the indigenous peoples—advocating against punitive expeditions, non-violence, religious assimilation, and the independence and autonomy of indigenous peoples. This marks him as a human rights activist with tendencies towards Christian socialism or cosmopolitanism (Liu Shu-chin 2019: 152). Starting in 1928, Inoue used book reviews in newspapers and the latest media, such as radio stations, to promote the ideas in \"Notes on the Savages.\" In April 1929, his long-term struggle at the fringes of the law ended when he was severely punished for broadcasting \"Notes on the Savages\" on the radio, resulting in his suspension and the cessation of his work in mountain regions (Liu Shu-chin 2019: 155).\n\n\n戰後他繼續留在台灣直到1947年始返日，擔任大學講師並進行傳道工作。井上伊之助被稱為「臺灣原住民醫療與宣教之父」，其著作《生蕃記》為原住民研究的第一手資料，尤為再現馘首文化的珍貴風俗誌，並反映對日本理蕃政策的不同意見──反討蕃、不流血、宗教同化、原住民族獨立自主主義，也表明其為基督教社會主義或世界主義傾向的人權運動者（柳書琴2019：152）。1928 年起，井上利用報紙書評或最新媒體電臺，宣揚《生蕃記》相關理念。1929 年4 月，他在法制邊緣的長期遊戰，終因在電臺廣播《生蕃記》一事遭嚴重處分，勒令停職，中止其山地事務（柳書琴2019：155）。\n\n\nKuniyuki Itō believes that Inoue Inosuke's representation of the indigenous people transcended the racist perspectives of his time. Inoue abolished the term \"savages\" and popularized the term \"Takasago tribe.\" He approached indigenous customs from a relatively objective standpoint, positively evaluating their principles of fair distribution, gender equality, and notions of chastity. Furthermore, he described Inoue Inosuke as a \"sacrificial offering\" to ease the animosity between the Chinese (including Taiwanese) and the Japanese (Inoue Inosuke 2016: 336-337, 341).\n\n\n伊藤邦幸認為井上伊之助對原住民的再現，跳脫當時的種族主義視角，他廢止「生蕃」一詞，普及「高砂族」之稱，並以相對客觀的立場看待原住民習俗，對於公平分配、男女平等、貞操觀念給予正面評價。他更形容井上伊之助為緩和中國人（包括臺灣人）和日本人之間仇怨的「祭品」（井上伊之助2016：336-337、341）。\n\n\n3) Juji Nakada (November 20, 1870 - September 24, 1939) was a pastor, businessman, journalist, and revivalist. From 1888 to 1892, he studied in the theology department at Tokyo Eiwa School (the predecessor of Aoyama Gakuin University). In 1896, he went to the United States to study at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. During his time in the U.S., he met Reverend Charles E. Cowman of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1901, the Cowmans and Nakada established the \"Central Gospel Mission\" in Tokyo, later founding the \"Tokyo Bible Institute\" and the \"Oriental Missionary Society.\" In 1917, Nakada founded the Japan Holiness Church. The Oriental Missionary Society was an overseas missionary organization with mission fields throughout East Asia, South Asia, Central America, South America, and Europe.\n\n\n中田重治（Juji Nakada, 1870.11.20- 1939.9.24），牧師、商人、新聞工作者、奮興主義者。1888年-1892年在東京英和學校（青山學院前身）神學部就讀，1896年負笈美國芝加哥慕迪聖經學院。在美期間在恩惠衛理公會衛理公會認識牧師高滿（Charles E. Cowman），1901年高滿夫婦與中田在日本東京建立「中央福音傳道館」，而後創設「東京聖經學院」、「遠東宣教會」，1917年創立日本聖潔教會。「遠東宣教會」為一海外宣教團體，宣教範圍遍及東亞、南亞、中美、南美、歐洲。\n\n\nIn January 1926, Nakada advocated at the Tokyo Bible Institute that the time was ripe for missionary work in Taiwan and called for efforts to pioneer the mission. On the 11th of the same month, he and Fujio Abe traveled from Tokyo to Kobe and then took a ship to Keelung, where they were greeted by Inoue Inosuke, Kameyama, Chen Fangben, and Chen Xizhen on the dock. They then embarked on a preaching tour of the entire western part of the island, holding meetings primarily in Presbyterian church chapels. Nakada's visit not only officially initiated the Holiness Church's work in Taiwan but also laid the foundation for its future development there (Chen Zhubei 1989). Nakada's main contribution was introducing the Japanese Holiness Church, which combined the Holiness Movement and the beliefs of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and establishing the Taiwan Holiness Church. This diversified the Protestant presence in Taiwan, which had previously been largely monopolized by the Japanese Anglican Church that mainly targeted Japanese believers.\n\n\n1926年1月中田在東京聖經學院主張台灣傳道時機已然成熟，呼籲前往開拓，同月11日他和安部藤夫從東京到神戶，再搭船到基隆，井上伊之助、龜山、陳芳本、陳溪圳在基隆岸上迎接，之後作全島西部巡迴佈道，聚會多在長老教會禮拜堂舉行。中田此行不但正式開拓聖教會在台灣的工作，也奠定該會日後在台灣發展的根基（陳主培1989）。中田的主要貢獻在於引進揉合聖潔運動和宣道會信仰的日本聖潔教會並設立台灣聖教會，讓台灣的新教市場不再一元，雖稍早有日本聖公會傳入，但以日人信徒為其對象。\n\nSince then, a denomination in Taiwan has upheld Amyraldism, enriching Taiwan's theological landscape and adding to its theological diversity. The \"Far Eastern Mission\" it established also founded Taiwan's first post-war seminary, the \"Central Taiwan Theological Seminary,\" which trained many local ministers. However, Nakada and the Holy Church's efforts to attract Presbyterian Church members led to friction between the two. Lai Ren-Sheng, a preacher who had joined the Holy Church and later returned to the Presbyterian Church, once wrote articles criticizing the Holy Church and Nakada (Lai Ren-Sheng 1934: 4-5; Lai Ren-Sheng 1934: 2-3).\n\n從此台灣存在持亞米念主義的宗派，無異豐富台灣的神學景觀，增添神學多元性。其創立的「遠東宣教會」也創立了台灣在戰後的第一間神學院「中台神學院」，培養許多本地傳道者。不過，中田和聖教會對長老教會信徒的拉攏，使得長老教會與其發生芥蒂，曾改入聖教會後回到長老教會的傳道者賴仁聲即曾撰文批評該會和中田（賴仁聲 1934：4-5；賴仁聲 1934：2-3）。\n\nThomas Barclay (1849-1935) was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in England in 1921. In 1925, the Bible Society decided to revise the Pe̍h-ōe-jī Old Testament in the Amoy dialect, considering Barclay's earlier success in translating the New Testament. He was appointed to undertake this task. Barclay first returned to his home country to rest, and in the spring of 1927, he arrived in Amoy to begin the revision. The work was completed on December 30, 1930, and handed over to the Commercial Press in Shanghai for printing. However, in 1932, the January 28 Incident occurred in Shanghai, and the Commercial Press was bombed by the Japanese, destroying all printed copies of the Old Testament, nullifying his efforts. Fortunately, Barclay had made an additional copy of the manuscript, thus avoiding a total loss of his work. After returning to Taiwan, Barclay continued to frequently correspond with Shanghai, inquiring about the resumption of printing.\n\n巴克禮（Thomas Barclay, 1849-1935），巴克禮1921年獲選英國長老教會總會議長。1925年聖經公會決定改譯廈門音舊約白話字聖經，因念及巴克禮稍早翻譯新約之成效，故聘其擔任此項工作。巴克禮先回國休息，1927年春到廈門著手改譯，至1930年12月30日完成改譯工作，交付上海商務印書館印刷。未料1932年上海發生一二八事變，商務印書館被日本轟炸，所印舊約悉數毀於戰火，其工作成果化為烏有。幸而巴克禮之前另抄一份原稿，始避免前功盡棄。巴克禮回台後，仍不時馳函上海打探消息，詢問復工時間。\n\n\nIn October 1932, Barclay personally traveled to Shanghai to seek a resolution, which ultimately succeeded. The printing work was completed on August 4, 1933, and on December 25, he received the printed Old Testament. With this, Barclay's revision of the Pe̍h-ōe-jī Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, was finally completed. This Bible was widely circulated among Hokkien speakers in Taiwan, Fujian, and Southeast Asia for a long time.\n\n\nIn addition, Barclay supplemented the \"Chinese-English Dictionary of the Amoy Vernacular\" edited by Carstairs Douglas. As fifty years had passed since its publication, many new characters and scientific terms were not included and needed supplementation. For this, Barclay requested the mission board to send preacher Yang Shiyang to Tainan to assist. In May 1922, the two went to Shanghai to work on the supplements and simultaneously proofread the printing manuscript. In 1923, the \"Supplement to Dictionary Amoy Vernacular\" was published by the Commercial Press (Taiwan Presbyterian Church General Assembly History Committee 1965: 136-137; Ikawa Naoya 1936: 81-85). Barclay's work in revising the Bible and editing the dictionary holds significance beyond the religious sphere, making important contributions to Taiwanese literature.\n\n\n1932年10月巴克禮親自前往上海尋求解決，終得順利進行，於1933年8月4日印刷工作告一段落，12月25日收到印妥之舊約聖經。至此，巴克禮從創世記到啟示錄的白話字聖經改譯工作終告完成，此本聖經在台灣、福建、東南亞閩南語使用者之中流通甚廣，時間亦久。此外，巴克禮亦增補杜嘉德（Carstairs Douglas）編著之《廈門音漢英大辭典》，乃因本辭典付梓經過五十年，其間許多新字和科學用詞未收其中，需要增補。巴克禮為此向傳道局請求派傳道師楊士養至台南協助。1922年5月兩人前往上海進行增補工作並同時校對印刷原稿，1923年《廈門音漢英大辭典增補版》（Supplement to Dictionary Amoy Vernacular）於商務印書館出版（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：136-137；井川直衛1936：81-85）。巴克禮改譯聖經、編修辭典，其意義不僅限於宗教層面，對台灣文學亦有重要貢獻。 \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\n1) The United Church of Canada. In the early 20th century, the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Methodist Church, and the Congregational Church discussed unification. The latter two denominations received majority support from their members, but many churches in the eastern part of the Presbyterian Church were skeptical of this unification movement. However, at the 1921 General Assembly, the motion to promote unification was passed by 414 votes to 107. The minority opposition argued that the supporters had effectively declared the abolition of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, thus losing their rights within the church, leading the General Assembly to be controlled by the minority. The supporters, on the other hand, argued that according to Article 112 of the Presbyterian Church Constitution, which states that \"the General Assembly is the highest authority of the church, and its decisions are final,\" the minority had no right to challenge the majority's decision. On July 19, 1924, the Canadian Parliament passed the United Church of Canada Act. At the General Assembly from June 3 to 9, 1925, the formation of the United Church of Canada was publicly announced, and the Presbyterian Church in Canada was dissolved. However, 79 members of the General Assembly insisted on preserving the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly and continued it.\n\n\nThe split in the Presbyterian Church of Canada affected the overseas mission areas of the northern Taiwan Presbyterian Church. At that time, apart from George William Mackay, the son of George Leslie Mackay, all the missionaries supported the United Church and attempted to convert northern Taiwan into a mission area of the United Church of Canada, and for a time in 1926, it was rebranded. However, in September 1926, the northern churches decided to affiliate with the Presbyterian Church, and the missionaries who belonged to the United Church subsequently left the north, with some relocating to southern churches. Consequently, the number of northern Presbyterian Church missionaries decreased from 25 to 5, resulting in the loss of many experienced senior missionaries and significantly impacting the development of the church (Taiwan Presbyterian Church General Assembly History Committee 1965: 200-203; Zheng Yang'en 2019: 22-23; Tiedemann 2009: 226).\n\n\n加拿大聯合教會（United Church of Canada）。二十世紀初加拿大長老教會、衛理公會、公理會研議合一，其餘兩會得到內部多數信徒贊成，然而長老教會東部許多教會對於此合一運動表示懷疑。但是到1921年的總會會議，卻以414票對107票通過推動聯合的議案。居於少數的反對派認為，贊成派實已表示廢止加拿大長老教會，故也表示失去在長老教會裡的權利，總會遂由少數派控制。贊成派則主張根據長老教會憲章112條載明「總會是教會的最高機構，其議決乃為最後的決定」，少數人對多數人通過的議決無權置喙，1924年7月19日加拿大國會又通過加拿大聯合教會的法案。1925年6月3日到9日總會中，公開宣佈加拿大聯合教會成立，並裁撤加拿大長老教會。然而有79名總會議員堅持保留長老教會總會，將之延續下去。加拿大長老教會的分裂影響到台灣北部長老教會的海外宣道區歸屬，當時宣教士當中除了馬偕之子偕叡廉（George William Mackay）以外都支持聯合教會，並企圖將台灣北部變更為加拿大聯合教會宣道區，並在1926年一度易幟。然而1926年9月北部教會決定歸屬長老教會，而歸屬聯合教會的宣教士遂紛紛離開北部，部分遷至南部教會。北部長老教會宣教士因而從25位減至5位，失去許多經驗豐富的資深宣教士，對該會發展帶來頗大衝擊（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：200-203；鄭仰恩2019：22-23；Tiedemann2009：226）。\n\nTrue Jesus Church. In the autumn of 1925, Huang Xiu-liang, the father of cultural anti-Japanese activist Huang Cheng-cong, brought the faith from Zhangzhou to his hometown in Xianxi, Changhua. On March 2, 1926, Huang Cheng-cong, along with Zhang Barnabas and six others, arrived in Taiwan to spread the True Jesus Church faith, preaching in Xianxi, Tainan, Chiayi Niutiaowan, Qingshui, and Taipei. Within forty days, they established three churches in Xianxi, Niutiaowan, and Qingshui, baptizing 62, 27, and 11 people respectively. In November of the same year, the Taiwan branch was established, and the first branch meeting was held at the Xianxi Church with over 100 participants (Huang Elisha 1956: 5-6).\n\n真耶穌教會（True Jesus Church）。1925年秋由文化抗日者黃呈聰之父黃秀兩從漳州傳回其家鄉彰化線西。1926年3月2日黃呈聰與張巴拿巴等共8人抵台傳真耶穌教會信仰，在線西、台南、嘉義牛挑灣、清水、台北傳道，四十天的時間內即建立線西、牛挑灣、清水三間教會，施洗人數分別為62人、27人、11名。同年11月隨即成立台灣支部，在線西教會召開第一次支部大會，與會者100多人（黃以利沙1956：5-6）。\n\n\nIn its early days, the True Jesus Church primarily evangelized to members of the Presbyterian Church, even converting existing Presbyterian congregations into True Jesus Church congregations. This caused the Presbyterian Church to feel a sense of competition and threat in the religious market for the first time. This attempt to \"reaffiliate\" believers led to backlash, resulting in long-term hostility and an inability to cooperate between the two churches (Wu Xue-ming 2012: 118-121).\n\n真耶穌教會初期傳道對象多是長老教會信徒，甚至連將原來長老教會的堂會轉變成真耶穌教會的會堂，使長老教會初次感受到宗教市場的競爭和威脅感，此般試圖讓信徒「改信」（reaffiliation）的行止引其反彈，雙方不但無法合作且自此長期敵對（吳學明2012：118-121）。\n\n\nAdditionally, the entry of the True Jesus Church into Taiwan inadvertently led to the establishment of the Japanese new religious sect \"Spirit of Jesus Church\" in 1941. This was due to Murai Ton, the superintendent of the Japanese Bible Church (the predecessor of the Japan Assemblies of God), accepting the True Jesus Church faith in Taiwan and later establishing a church based on this faith, adapting its nationalist discourse to a Japanese version.\n\n此外，真耶穌教會的入台，在1941年意外促成日本新興宗派「耶穌之御靈教會」建立，事乃出自日本聖書教會（日本神召會前身）監督村井屯在台接受真耶穌教會信仰，後在其信仰基礎上自立教會，尤其借用該會國族主義論述，轉為日本版本。\n\n\nThe True Jesus Church was the first denomination in Taiwan with Pentecostal roots, emphasizing healing, exorcism, and receiving the Holy Spirit, bringing a new option to Taiwan's Protestant market and attracting many new members. It was also the first indigenous Chinese independent church to be introduced to Taiwan, appealing to the local people. Huang Cheng-cong's introduction of the church was a blend of Christian faith and nationalistic spirit, providing Taiwanese people with an alternative to Western denominations, which may have been one of the main reasons for the church's rapid growth.\n\n\n真耶穌教會是台灣第一個有五旬節運動淵源而標榜醫病趕鬼、領受聖靈的教派，為台灣的新教市場帶來另一新興選項，因此被吸引入會者眾。同時，其也是第一個傳入台灣的華人本土自立教會，對本地人有親緣性，黃呈聰引入該會，即是出自基督教信仰和民族精神的揉合，提供臺灣人不同於西方教派的選項，或許亦為該會快速成長主因之一。\n\nJapan Holiness Church. This is the predecessor of the Taiwan Holiness Church. It emerged from the Holiness Movement and the missionary atmosphere of the early 20th century. In 1901, Juji Nakada and Charles E. Cowman established the \"Central Gospel Mission\" in Japan, traveling around to hold evangelistic meetings and engage in ministry among telegraph operators, prisoners, industrial workers, and leprosy patients. In 1911, they further promoted a nationwide evangelistic campaign in Japan, whose aggressive mission activities far surpassed other Japanese denominations, thus shocking the Japanese Christian community and garnering mixed reviews. Initially, they did not establish churches but \"mission halls.\" It wasn't until 1917 that the \"Japan Holiness Church\" was formed. Within ten years, the church had grown to over 100 congregations with more than 3,000 members. The church also expanded overseas, ministering to Japanese immigrants in South America and conducting missionary work in Korea, Taiwan, and other colonies.\n\n\n日本聖潔教會（Japan Holiness Church）。即日後之台灣聖教會前身。該會是二十世紀初聖潔運動和宣教運動氛圍下的產物，1901年中田重治和高滿（Charles E. Cowman）到日本開設「中央福音傳道館」，遊走各地舉行佈道會，並進行電信、監獄、工業、痲瘋病患傳道工作。1911年更推動日本全國逐家佈道運動，其傳教積極程度遠超日本其他教派，因此震撼日本教界且帶來褒貶不一的評價。初期不建立教會，而是「傳道館」，1917年才組成「日本聖潔教會」，十年內教會成長至100多間，信徒人數3000多人，同時往海外伸展，向南美洲日本移民宣教，也向韓國、台灣等殖民地宣教。\n\n\nIn 1921, the church organized the \"Tabernacle Evangelistic Team\" to evangelize in Taiwan. They returned in 1923 and, in 1926, Juji Nakada and Fujio Abe officially came to Taiwan to establish the church. Initially, they received assistance from several Presbyterian Church members, mainly targeting the Japanese in Taiwan. It wasn't until 1928, when Wang Jin-yuan established a church in Xigang, Tainan, that the first congregation primarily composed of Taiwanese was formed (Cai Ruifen 2007: 16; Chen Zhupei 1989: 57-58, 47-49; Tiedemann 2009: 173-174).\n\n\n該會1921年已組織「帳幕傳道隊」來台佈道，1923年再度來台，至1926年中田重治和安部藤夫正式來台設教，剛開始得幾位長老教會人士協助，對象主要是在台日人，直到1928年王錦源在台南西港立會始為首間臺灣人為主的堂會（蔡瑞芬2007：16；陳主培1989：57-58、47-49；Tiedemann2009：173-174）。\n\n\nThe Japan Holiness Church introduced new evangelistic methods and offered a faith distinct from the Presbyterian Church, including the \"Fourfold Gospel\" (regeneration, sanctification, divine healing, and the second coming). This brought a new option to Taiwan's Protestant market, adding to the diversity of Protestant beliefs and denominations, particularly with its advocacy of Amyraldism. However, it attracted many Presbyterian Church members, leading to friction between the two churches (Lai Ren-sheng 1934: 4-5; Lai Ren-sheng 1934: 2-3). By 1926, the church had 17 congregations, with 726 people baptized (Chen Zhupei 1989: 156).\n\n\n日本聖潔教會因其傳教方式新穎且提供有別於長老教會的信仰內容如「四重福音」（重生、成聖、神醫、再臨），為台灣新教市場帶來另一種選擇，亦使新教信仰和宗派更為多元，尤其帶入主張亞米念主義的信仰，其貢獻在於此。然而卻因吸引許多長老教會信徒改信該會，造成長老教會與其發生芥蒂（賴仁聲 1934：4-5；賴仁聲 1934：2-3）。該會1926年即有17間教會，726人接受洗禮（陳主培1989：156）。 \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nApostolic Nuncio Mario Giardini visited Taiwan. In 1913, the Catholic Church in Taiwan separated from the Apostolic Vicariate of Amoy and became the Apostolic Prefecture of Taiwan, starting to engage more with Spanish Dominicans from the Apostolic Vicariate of Shikoku in Japan and gradually reducing its ties to China. In the spring of 1923, the Apostolic Nuncio to Japan, Mario Giardini, visited Taiwan. He arrived in Keelung on January 15, where he was received by officials from the Governor-General's Office and met with consular officers from the UK, US, and Netherlands. He also visited the Dominican-established St. Joseph Technical High School for Girls.\n\n\n教廷使節Mario Giardini來台巡視（Apostolic Nuncio Mario Giardini visited Taiwan）。1913年台灣天主教會脫離廈門監牧區，獨立成台灣監牧區，開始與日本四國監牧區西班牙道明會士多有交流，逐漸去中國化。1923年春駐日教廷使節Mario Giardini來台巡視，1月15日抵達基隆，總督府人員予以接待，並與英、美、荷蘭領事等外國駐台官員會面，此外參觀道明會建立的靜修女中。\n\n\nGiardini then traveled to Taichung for further visits, proceeded to Kaohsiung in the south where he toured an orphanage, and went to Wanjin in Pingtung to meet indigenous Catholic converts. Returning to Kaohsiung, he donated 500 yen for the reconstruction of the Wuquai Church. He continued his tour to Tainan, where he attended a Taiwanese language evangelistic meeting, and then visited Pujianglun Church, passing through Douliu Church, hosted by Taiwan Sugar Corporation, and on to Tianzhong Church. He traveled from Tianzhong to Yuanlin Church and then to Luocuo Village, finally returning to Taipei via Yuanlin, departing from Keelung for Japan on February 1.\n\n\n後轉往台中，參觀，再往南部高雄，參觀孤兒院，又到屏東萬金，訪問原住民教友，再回高雄，並贈金五百元重建五塊厝教堂。後北上臺南，再參加台語佈道會；訪畢由台南前往埔羌崙教會，途中順便經過斗南教會，接受台糖公司接待，再到斗六教會，再赴田中教會，從田中到員林教會，再到羅厝莊，最後才取道員林返回臺北，2月1日從基隆返日。\n\n\nGiardini expressed being deeply impressed by the Dominican mission work in Taiwan. He was accompanied by Fr. Hisanobu Hayasaka, who documented the trip in a series of articles titled \"Taiwan Snippets: Accompanying the Nuncio,\" published in three installments in the Japanese Catholic magazine \"The Voice.\" These articles reflected the state of the Catholic Church in Taiwan to the Japanese Catholic community and included some personal interpretations of Taiwanese customs and social conditions, sometimes revealing a colonial or Orientalist perspective. This visit highlighted the globalization and localization of the Catholic Church in Taiwan, its independence from the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Chinese Catholic Church, and the establishment of its relationship with the Japanese Church (Ku Wei-ying 2008: 315-347; Ku Wei-ying 2008: 166).\n\n\nGiardini表示對道明會在台灣的傳教工作印象深刻。此次教廷使節巡視由秘書早坂久之助神父陪同，並就此行寫下〈台灣拾掇：伴隨使節記行〉，分為三次在日本天主教刊物《聲》刊登，向日本天主教界反映台灣天主教會實況。本文同時報導台灣風土民情，對此有一些個人詮釋，難免略有殖民者觀點或東方主義的再現。此次巡訪凸顯台灣天主教會的全球在地化，也凸顯其已脫離中國的天主教會教階制度體系而獨立，並與日本教會建立關係（古偉瀛2008：315-347；古偉瀛2008：166）。\n\n\n**Establishment of the United Church of Canada**\n\n\nThe parent church of the Northern Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Presbyterian Church in Canada, negotiated a union with the Methodist Church and the Congregational Church in the early 20th century. In September 1924, the church split into the \"United Church of Canada,\" which supported the union, and the \"Presbyterian Church in Canada,\" which opposed the union and advocated maintaining the original denomination. By June 10, 1925, the Methodist Church had 4,797 churches, the Congregational Church had 166 churches, and the Presbyterian Church had 3,728 churches, totaling 8,691 churches joining the \"United Church.\" There were 784 churches that did not join the \"United Church.\" Among the overseas missionaries of the three denominations, 655 joined the \"United Church,\" while only 17 did not.\n\n\n加拿大聯合教會成立（Establishment of the United Church of Canada）。北部長老教會的母會加拿大長老教會在二十世紀初協議與衛理公會、公理會聯合。1924年9月分裂為贊成聯合的「加拿大聯合教會」（United Church of Canada）和不贊成聯合而主張維持原來見制的「加拿大長老教會」（Presbyterian Church in Canada ）。至1925年6月10日，衛理公會有4797所教會，公理會有166所教會，長老教會有3728所教會，共8691所教會參加「聯合教會」 ，而未加入「聯合教會」的有784間。而三個教派駐在海外之傳教士，其加入「 聯合教會」者有655名，未加入者僅有17名。\n\n\nIn September 1925, when the \"Presbyterian Church in Canada\" delineated foreign mission areas, the northern Taiwan mission area remained under the \"Presbyterian Church.\" It was decided that from early 1927, the \"Presbyterian Church in Canada\" would assume the management of the northern Taiwan mission area. This caused issues for the missionaries of the \"United Church of Canada\" in northern Taiwan, leading some to leave and others to transfer to the south. As a result, the number of missionaries in the northern Presbyterian Church drastically decreased, losing many experienced senior missionaries, which significantly impacted the church's development (Huang Wudong & Xu Qianxin 1962: 174-175).\n\n\n「加拿大長老教會」於1925年9月在劃定異邦宣道區時，臺灣北部宣道區仍舊歸屬於「長老教會」，並訂於1927年初起「加拿大長老教會」擬承擔臺灣北部宣道區的管理。此事造成「加拿大聯合教會」之北部臺灣的宣教士的進退問題，而後有的離開，有的轉往南部。北部長老教會宣教士因而驟減，失去不少經驗豐富的資深宣教士，為該會發展帶來衝擊（黃武東、徐謙信1962：174-175）。 \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\n**Non-church Movement**\n\n\nThe Non-church Movement advocates that faith in Christ does not necessarily require institutional structures and rituals, meaning one does not need to participate in church activities to practice their faith. This theory was founded by Uchimura Kanzō. In 1891, while serving as a substitute teacher, Uchimura refused to bow to the Emperor's signature next to the Imperial Rescript on Education, leading to attacks from his colleagues and students. This incident made him acutely aware of the tension between being \"Japanese and a Christian.\"\n\n\nDuring the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, Uchimura began to reflect on the justification of war and resolved to follow Christ's principle of non-resistance. After continued contemplation on the relationship between Christian faith and Japan, he realized that simply understanding church independence as freedom from Western missionary control could often devolve into narrow nationalism, losing the capacity to independently think about the nation's direction with God at the center. Therefore, he concluded that it was also necessary to free oneself from the constraints of nationalism and patriotism within other Japanese churches.\n\n\nHe understood that the independence of faith was not isolation or loneliness but \"relying on the God within the heart.\" This was Uchimura's way of maintaining a relationship with society without being subordinated to it. He defined the church broadly, opposing narrow, institutionalized interpretations. In other words, he advocated that faith in Christ does not necessarily require institutional structures and rituals, and one does not need to attend church gatherings to practice their faith.\n\n\nSeveral Non-church Movement activists were active in Taiwan during the 1920s, such as Inoue Inosuke, Yanaihara Tadao, Masamichi Jin, and Matsumoto Takashi. Yanaihara Tadao had the most direct influence on the Non-church Movement in Taiwan. In 1929, centered around Wang Shoulu, Cai Ronghua, Huang Lü'ao, and Lin Tianshui, the first Non-church gatherings among Taiwanese began, with about forty people participating in the initial meeting. Other Taiwanese individuals such as Guo Fangqin (a Presbyterian), Xie Wan'an, and Cai Haiqing joined in the 1920s.\n\n\nUnlike other Japanese churches' missionary activities in Taiwan, the Non-church Movement's evangelical activities primarily targeted Taiwanese people, setting it apart from other church missions (Chen Zhizhong 2005: 45-54).\n\n\n無教會主義。主張相信基督不必然要透過制度和儀式，即不用藉參加教會來實踐信仰。此論創始者為內村鑑三，1891他在擔任代課教師期間，於「教育敕語奉讀式」中未對天皇在敕語旁的簽名行鞠躬禮，而被師生攻擊，因而強烈意識到身為「日本人與基督徒」的張力。在日清和日俄戰爭中，內村開始反思戰爭的正當性，決意「效法基督的不抵抗主義」。在持續思考基督教信仰和日本的關係後，他發現單將教會獨立理解為脫離西方差會的控制，往往可能衍生成狹隘的愛國主義，失去以神為中心獨立思考民族方向的能力，因此最終也需脫離其他日本教會的民族主義和愛國主義思維桎梏。他意識到信仰的獨立不是孤立或是孤獨，而是「依賴心中的神」，這是內村與社會保持關係，但又不被統屬的交通方式。他從廣義的角度定義教會，反對從狹義、體制化的角度去理解。意即主張相信基督不必然要透過制度和儀式，不需藉參加教會聚會以實踐信仰。幾位無教會主義運動者在1920年代曾經在台活動，例如井上伊之助、矢內原忠雄、政池仁、松本巍等人。其中矢內原忠雄對台灣無教會主義思想影響最直接，1929年以王受祿、蔡榮華、黃履鰲、林添水共四人為中心，開始了最初台灣人的無教會聚會，第一次聚會大約有四十人參與。1920年代臺灣人尚有郭芳欽（長老教會信徒）、謝萬安、蔡海清等加入。相對於其他日本來台宣教的教會，無教會主義在台灣的傳道活動一直是以台灣人為主要對象，不同於其他教會所做的宣教事工（陳志忠2005：45-54）。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nAfter the Japanese colonial regime firmly established its rule over Taiwan, the anti-Christian incidents that were common in the late Qing Dynasty disappeared, and there were no organized anti-Christian movements or leaders. By the mid-1920s, many Christians had become key members of society. Although they were a minority, they were highly influential and no longer as easily targeted for attacks by the local gentry as they were during the late Qing period. The previous collusion between local government officials and gentry to incite such attacks was also no longer seen.\n\n\n日本殖民政權領台底定之後，清末時常出現的反教事件已消聲匿跡，並無組織性的反教運動和反教領袖。1920年代的日治中期許多基督徒已成為社會中堅份子，雖佔少數但深具影響力，不復如清末地方仕紳那般容易煽動民眾予以攻擊，過去地方官府與仕紳連成一氣的情況也不復見。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\n**Japanese Colonial Regime**: From 1896 to 1930, the relationship between the Japanese colonial government and Christianity was relatively harmonious, and religious freedom was allowed, leading to better development of Christianity compared to the Qing Dynasty period. However, the Japanese regime prohibited Christian churches and other religions from proselytizing to the indigenous people. Under its \"aborigines policy,\" it attempted to assimilate the indigenous people through the spread of Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism to achieve effective governance. Some scholars point out that after 1895, Japan became the only colonial power in Asia. Lacking colonial experience, Japan studied and emulated the colonial practices of Western countries like the Netherlands and the UK, thus placing importance on the role of religion in colonization. \n\n\nThe cooperation between Buddhism and colonialism began with the Jodo and Soto schools. Some missionaries preached within the boundaries of the indigenous areas. Later, with the support of the Japanese government, missionary work in indigenous areas was primarily undertaken by the Honganji branch of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism (Fan Chun-wu, 1999:255). In addition to collaborating with familiar Buddhist sects in Taiwan, the Japanese government especially promoted its state religion, Shintoism, to instill patriotism and assert control. As Shintoism was not merely a religion but also a symbol of the Japanese nation and the imperial family, it advocated loyalty to the imperial family and worship of its ancestors. The Japanese government extensively established Shinto shrines in the mountainous regions, enforced worship, and banned the promotion of other religions (Historical Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan General Assembly, 1965:206, 365). \n\n\nUnder these circumstances, traditional indigenous religions were significantly weakened, and various traditional festivals were banned. The church actively planned to evangelize the mountainous regions from the early 20th century but was consistently prohibited, making missionary work impossible. However, some indigenous people who encountered Christianity outside the mountainous regions became pioneers in mountain evangelism, such as Jiwang, Xu Nanmian, Gao Tianwang, and Dawai (Lin Jinshui, 2003:268-269).\n\n\n日本殖民政府（Japanese Colonial Regime）。1896年以後，1930年之前，日本殖民政府與基督教之間的關係相對和諧，也允許宗教自由，使基督教得到較清朝時期更好的發展。然而日本政權禁止基督教會以及其他宗教向原住民傳教，在其「理蕃政策」框架下試圖以日本的佛教與神道教的傳播同化原住民，達到有效治理的目標。有學者指出，自 1895年後，日本成為亞洲惟一的殖民國家，殖民經驗的不足，使日本思考與仿傚過去西方荷、英等殖民國家的殖民經驗，宗教上的殖民效用遂受重視。佛教與殖民的合作由淨土宗、曹洞宗開始，在隨軍佈教的情形下，一些佈教使曾於各蕃界內佈教。其後在日本政府支持下，蕃地的佈道工作以真宗本願寺派為主（范純武 1999：255）。日本政府除了藉已然為台灣熟悉的佛教諸派以外為合作對象以外，尤其運用本身的國教神道教宣傳愛國意識並予以征服，因其不獨是宗教且為日本國族與皇室象徵，主張效忠皇室、拜祭皇室祖先。日本政府在山地廣設神社，強迫膜拜，其他宗教宣傳一概被禁止（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：206、365）。在此情況下，原住民傳統宗教受到明顯削弱，各種祭典傳統被禁絕。教會在台灣從二十世紀初即積極籌劃進入山地傳教，但都遭到禁止，傳教工作無法開展。但其中有部分山地原住民在外接觸基督教，成為山地傳教先驅，如姬望、許南免、高添旺、打歪等人（林金水2003：268-269）。 \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\n**Anti-Christian Movement in China**: In the 1920s, China experienced an anti-Christian movement that can be divided into four periods: protests initiated by the Anti-Christian Student Alliance in Shanghai and the Beijing Anti-Religious Federation in 1922; the period before the May Thirtieth Incident (1924-1925), focusing on reclaiming educational rights; the anti-imperialist movement following the May Thirtieth Incident; and the anti-Christian and xenophobic wave during the Northern Expedition from autumn 1926 to spring 1927 (Luo Weihong, 2014: 387).\n\n\nAlthough the anti-Christian wave in China did not directly affect Taiwanese society, the anti-Christian and xenophobic trend initiated by the Northern Expedition in 1926-1927 impacted many missionaries working in mainland China, causing them to temporarily seek refuge in Japan and Taiwan. Simultaneously, due to the United Church of Canada incident in 1927, many missionaries in northern Taiwan left, and those missionaries temporarily fleeing China were invited to work in Taiwan, filling the gap caused by the United Church of Canada incident. For instance, John F. Fleming and Robert B. McClure of the Canadian United Church's Henan Mission served in northern Taiwan for a year. Fleming taught English in Tamsui, while McClure assisted with Mackay's medical work. However, these missionaries could only serve for a short period, leading the Presbyterian Church in Canada to send more missionaries to Taiwan (Historical Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan General Assembly, 1965: 203).\n\n\nThough the Anti-Christian Movement did not directly affect Taiwan, it led to missionaries fleeing China, with some coming to Taiwan. Alongside the departure of missionaries due to the United Church of Canada incident, these two international events converged in Taiwan, illustrating their indirect impact and the result of globalization.\n\n\n中國的非基運動（Anti-Christian Movement）。中國在1920年代發生可分為四個時期的反基督教運動：1922年非上海基督教學生同盟、北京非宗教大同盟發起的抗議；1924-1925年五卅慘案前，以收回教育權為主線；五卅慘案後的反帝運動；1926年秋至1927年春的北伐期間（羅偉虹2014：387）。雖然中國的反教浪潮並未直接影響台灣社會，帶來連動效果，然而1926-1927年以北伐軍策動的反教和排外風潮，衝擊許多宣教士在中國大陸的工作，因而暫時避難到日本和台灣。同時，1927年由於加拿大聯合教會事件風波，不少台灣北部教會宣教士陸續離開，而前述暫時離開中國避難的宣教士，即獲邀在台工作，正好補足加拿大聯合教會事件導致的宣教士短缺問題。例如加拿大聯合教會河南宣道會傅理明（John F. Fleming）與羅明遠（Robert B. McClure）在北台灣服務一年。前者在淡水教英文，後者協助馬偕的醫療工作。然而，這些宣教士只能短期服務，加拿大長老教會因此又陸續差派宣教士來台（台灣基督長老教會總會歷史委員會1965：203）。非基運動雖未直接影響臺灣，但其導致的宣教士逃離，其中部分來台；加上加拿大聯合教會事件導致宣教士離開，兩件國際事件匯合在臺灣，可見其間接影響，是為全球化之結果。 ",
