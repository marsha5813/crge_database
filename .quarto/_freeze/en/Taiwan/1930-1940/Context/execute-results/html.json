Although the Meiji Constitution guaranteed religious freedom, the state still retained the authority to control public religion, claiming that legislative regulation fell within a reasonable scope. Traditional Japanese religions, mainly Buddhism, believed that legalizing religious organizations would elevate the status of Christianity, reducing the relative advantage of traditional religions. Consequently, they obstructed the legislative process, causing the bill to be repeatedly rejected by the National Diet in 1899, 1927, and 1929.\n\n\n（1）國家總動員法\n\n明治中期，日本政府企圖透過立法統一規範宗教活動。明治憲法雖規定宗教自由，但國家仍有節制大眾宗教之權，因此政府聲稱立法管制屬於合理的範圍內。以佛教界為主的日本傳統宗教認為，若將宗教團體法制化，基督教的位階將會提高，縮減傳統宗教相對優勢的地位，因此阻撓立法過程，致使該草案於1899、1927、1929年屢次被國會駁回。\n\n\nRegarding policies on Christianity, the Japanese government only granted legitimacy in 1899 through the Ministry of Home Affairs Order No. 41, \"Regulations on the Announcement and Establishment of Religious Buildings for Religions Other Than Shinto and Buddhism,\" incorporating it into the management of religious administration. However, religious activities and the establishment of churches still required permission and investigation by the Ministry of Education and local authorities. Thus, while Christianity became a legal religion, it remained under state supervision and control.\n\n關於基督教的政策，1899年日本政府以內務省令第41號〈關於神佛道以外的宗教宣布及堂宇會堂等之規定〉中，才獲得合法性，納入宗教行政之管理。惟宗教活動與教會的設立仍須受文部省及地方官廳的許可、調查。因此基督教雖然成為合法的宗教，卻受到國家的監督統制。\n\n\nIn the 1930s, with the rise of fascism, from the February 26 Incident to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan became increasingly entrenched in war, leading to stricter control and repression of religion. In April 1938, the Japanese government promulgated Law No. 55, the National Mobilization Law, clearly stating that the nation had transitioned from a \"quasi-war period\" to a \"war period.\" To consolidate national defense and maximize national power, it was necessary to control and utilize all resources to achieve military objectives. Concerning civic organizations, the law's compulsory nature allowed the government to establish, merge, change, and abolish both homogeneous and heterogeneous enterprises and organizations or limit membership under control agreements. Additionally, the Japanese government had the authority to approve the conditions or regulations of organizational members and could increase control through imperial ordinances when necessary.\n\n\n1930年代，隨著法西斯主義高漲，從二二六事件至盧溝橋事變，日本陷在戰爭泥沼中，對宗教的管制與鎮壓日趨嚴厲。1938年4月，日本政府發佈法律第55號「國家總動員法」，明確指出國家已從「準戰爭時期」進入「戰爭時期」，為鞏固國防及發揮最大的國力，必須統制運用所有的資源，以達成軍事目的。在人民團體方面，基於法律的強制性，無論同質或異質的事業、團體，政府均得加以設立、合併、變更及廢止，或在統制協定之下限定加盟者。此外，日本政府亦對團體的組織成員的條件或是規程擁有認可權，必要時還可透過勅令增加控制權。\n\n\n**(2) Religious Organizations Law**\n\n\nIn 1939, with the aim of religious control, the Japanese government promulgated Law No. 77, the \"Religious Organizations Law.\" During the legislative process, as nationalism surged, opposition was suppressed. Prime Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma stated, \"To enable religion to fulfill its original function, protection and supervision are necessary. All religions must be integrated with our national ideology.\" Education Minister Sadao Araki emphasized in his proposal explanation, \"In extraordinary times, the state should supervise, control, protect, and nurture religion to make it more effectively align with wartime efforts. Therefore, the Religious Organizations Law is indispensable.\" Matsuo Nagazo, the Director of the Religious Bureau of the Ministry of Education, also declared, \"If religious organizations or their teachers spread doctrines that reject shrine worship or incite others to reject it, it clearly violates public order and harms public welfare, and they will be severely punished under this law.\" This illustrates that the Religious Organizations Law was essentially a wartime religious control decree.\n\n\n（2）宗教團體法\n\n1939年，日本政府以宗教統制為目的，發佈法律第77號〈宗教團體法〉，在法令制訂的過程中，因國家主義高漲，反對聲浪遭受壓制。首相平沼騏一郎表示：「欲使宗教發揮其本來之機能，必須給予保護監督。任何宗教皆須融合我國國體觀念之事。」文部大臣荒木貞夫則在提案的解釋中強調：「非常時期國家應對宗教進行監督、管制、保護與培育，使宗教更有效地配合戰爭，所以宗教團體法是不可或缺的。」文部省宗教局長松尾長造也說：「宗教團體及其教師若於教義上散佈拒絕神社祭拜或指使他人拒拜之行為，則明白違反安寧秩序、損害公益，將依本法處以嚴刑。」由上可知，〈宗教團體法〉實際上即為戰時體制的宗教統制法令。\n\n\nThe Religious Organizations Law consisted of 37 articles in total (Articles 29-37 being supplementary provisions). Chapter 1 stipulated that \"religious organizations\" were divided into five types: Shinto sects, Buddhist sects, Christian denominations, temples, and churches. The first three were organized religious groups, while the latter two referred to independent temples or churches. Chapter 2 defined \"religious associations\" as gatherings for the purpose of proclaiming religious doctrines and performing rituals, other than \"religious organizations,\" including folk religions. Chapter 3 prescribed \"penalties,\" including fines for \"violations of restrictions and prohibitions.\" Chapter 4 contained supplementary provisions, including the implementation date and the repeal of previous laws.\n\n〈宗教團體法〉全文共37條（第29-37條為附則），第一章規定「宗教團體」分為神道教派、佛教宗派、基督教教團、寺院、教會五種類型，前三者是有組織的宗教團體，後兩者指獨立的寺院或是教會。第二章規定的「宗教結社」，係指「宗教團體」以外，為宗教的教義宣布、儀式的執行等目的而聚集者，如民間宗教即屬之。第三章規定「罰則」，包括「制限禁止的違背」等罰金。第四章附則，即「經過規定」，包括施行日、舊法令的廢止等。\n\n\nThe law aimed to \"supervise and protect religious organizations to ensure their healthy development, contributing to society, promoting spiritual upliftment, and guiding thought, while preventing and stopping various harmful effects.\" The regulations clearly specified penalties and had coercive power. If, during the proclamation or execution of doctrines, there were violations of public order, citizen duties, legal orders, or public safety, penalties would be imposed. Article 26 stipulated that those who violated restrictions and prohibitions should be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for up to six months or fined up to 500 yen. Article 27 stipulated that those who violated association registration requirements should be fined up to 300 yen. Article 28 stipulated that those who violated corporate registration requirements should be fined up to 200 yen. Evidently, the law nearly encroached on the boundaries of religious freedom, and the fines were quite substantial.\n\n該法令旨在「監督保護宗教團體，使其能健全發展，貢獻於社會，有力促進精神作興及思想啟導，預防阻止種種的弊害發生」。法規內容明訂罰則，具有強制力，當宣布或執行教義時，若有違背安寧秩序、臣民義務、法律命令、公共安全等情事，將受到處分。第26條規定，違反制限禁止相關法令者應處6個月以下的懲役、禁錮或500圓以下的罰金。第27條規定，違反結社申請相關事項者應處300圓以下的罰金。第28條規定，違反法人登記相關事項者，應處200圓以下的罰金。顯然的，該法令幾乎觸及宗教自由的邊緣，罰金額度亦頗為高昂。\n\n\nThe Religious Organizations Law was officially implemented in May 1940. In September, the Ministry of Education convened a meeting with representatives of Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity under the theme \"Strategies for Religious Activities in Response to the Current Situation,\" urging internal mergers within each religion. Initially, Buddhism had 13 sects and 56 schools, but under the government's policy of \"merging into a single sect,\" it was reduced to 13 sects and 28 schools by 1941.\n\n1940年5月〈宗教團體法〉正式實施， 9月文部省召集神道、佛教、基督教的代表，以「因應目前時局之宗教活動策略」為題召開協議會，要求各宗教內部進行合併。佛教原有13宗56派，在政府「同一宗組合併唯一宗派」的方針下，1941年縮減為13宗28派。 \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\n**(1) Repatriation of Missionaries**\n\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government tightened its control over foreigners. In 1939, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued Directive No. 6, \"Regarding the Entry, Stay, and Departure of Foreigners.\" The Taiwan Governor-General's Office promptly announced this directive through Official Ordinance No. 50. The directive required that foreigners traveling or staying in various parts of Japan must report to the local police authorities within the specified time frame. In August 1939, after the German invasion of Poland ignited war in Europe, and in September 1940, after Japan formed a military alliance with Germany and Italy, the Japanese government issued a series of decrees to repatriate missionaries and reorganize theological schools.\n\n（1）宣教師的遣返\n\n中日戰爭爆發後，日本政府對外國人的管制趨於嚴格，1939年內務省公布省令第6號〈外国人ノ入国、滞在及退去ニ関スル件〉，臺灣總督府隨即以府令第50號公布該省令，內容係要求外國人在日本各地旅行、宿泊都必須在規定時間內向當地的警察機關報備。1939年8月，德軍入侵波蘭，歐洲燃起戰火，1940年9月與德、義合組軸心國軍事同盟，日本政府頒佈一連串的法令遣返宣教師以及神學校改組。\n\n\nIn December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, triggering the Pacific War and declaring war on the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia. The Japanese cabinet immediately revised and promulgated Ministry of Home Affairs Directive No. 32, \"Regarding the Entry, Stay, and Departure of Foreigners,\" and the \"Guidelines for the Treatment of Enemy Nationals.\" The Taiwan Governor-General's Office promptly announced these directives through Official Ordinance No. 153. These directives required all foreign nationals residing in fortress areas and around military bases to leave. Clergy from neutral countries, such as Spain, were given more lenient treatment. However, missionaries from enemy countries were subjected to harsh measures, including forced detention or expulsion. Many British and American missionaries still in Japan at the time were placed under house arrest or forcibly detained.\n\n1941年12月，日本攻擊珍珠港，太平洋戰爭爆發，日本向英、美、加與澳洲宣戰，內閣立刻修正公布內務省令第32號〈外国人ノ入国、滞在及退去ニ関スル件〉及〈敵国人取扱措置要領〉，臺灣總督府隨即以府令153號公布該省令。其內容規定所有居住在要塞地區與軍事基地周圍的外籍人士都必須離開，對西班牙等中立國的神職人員則較寬鬆。然而，對於敵國的宣教師則施以鐵腕，予以強制拘禁或命令驅逐。當時仍在日本本土的英、美宣教師多人被軟禁或強制拘留。\n\nFollowing this, the British Church received numerous reports of missionaries being expelled from various regions and issued notices to its mission districts, but the situation was already beyond their control. With Japan escalating the war, the global situation changed drastically within three months. British mission organizations across the Far East faced significant challenges, especially in South China and Malaysia. As previously mentioned, all missionaries in Taiwan had left by the end of 1940. They left behind detailed contingency plans, thereby avoiding many unpredictable dangers.\n\n緊接著，英國教會陸續接到各地宣教師被驅逐的消息，乃發信通知各個宣教區，但情勢已非掌控之中。隨著日本挑起戰爭，3個月內世界局勢丕變，英國在遠東各地的宣教機構都面臨接棒的問題，尤其是華南與馬來西亞等地最嚴峻。如前所述，臺灣的宣教師在1940年底即全數離開，不但留下周詳的配置計畫，也避免許多不可預測的危險。\n\n\n**(2) Training Sessions for Missionaries**\n\n\nFrom March 26 to April 1, 1943, the Education Bureau of the Governor-General's Office held the \"Training Sessions for Core Teachers\" at the National Spirit Training Center in Dazhi under the name of the \"Taiwan Christian Service Group.\" The first session had 47 participants, while the second and third sessions, held on June 10 and 24 respectively, each had 57 participants and lasted for a week.\n\n（2）傳教師鍊成會\n\n1943年3月26日至4月1日，總督府文教局以「臺灣基督教奉公團」名義，於大直國民精神研修所召開「中堅教師鍊成會」，第一回共47人；第二、三回分別於6月10、24日舉行，各回57人，為期一週。\n\n\nThe training sessions emphasized \"ideological transformation\" for clergy, with the goal of instilling the principles of Shinto and national spirit. Each session began at 9 a.m. on the first morning, with participants gathering at Meiji Bridge in Taipei (now around Zhongshan Bridge) and then visiting the Taiwan Shrine. The opening ceremony was held in front of the Amaterasu Omikami. The instructor, Nakanishi Asahi, an authority on Japanese Shinto who was well-versed in the Bible, emphasized that the Japanese Emperor was a \"living god,\" equating his divinity to that of Jesus Christ as an incarnation of God. His teachings forcefully interpreted Christian doctrines. The practical training focused on \"rigorous practice\" to understand the \"Japanese spirit\" and the \"true essence of the national body.\" This included cold-water immersion in the early morning, known as \"misogi,\" followed by meditation, recitation of Shinto prayers (norito), meetings, group discussions, self-reflection, and bonfire ceremonies (kagaribi), as well as writing and singing poems.\n\n教師鍊成會強調對神職人員的「思想改造」，目的在於灌輸神道宗旨和國民精神。鍊成會第二、三回分別從6月10、24日開始，時間長達一週，各有57人參加。每回鍊成會首日上午九時，成員均集合於臺北的明治橋（今中山橋一帶），接著參拜臺灣神社，在「天照大神之御前」舉行開會式。指導官中西旭*為日本神道權威，他熟稔聖經，強調日本天皇為「現人神」，神格宛如耶穌基督，乃是現實的神明「道成肉身」，授課內容穿鑿附會基督教教義。術科方面以「苦鍊修行」為主，體會「日本精神」與「國體本義」，清晨浸冷水，是為「禊」（みそぎ），接著靜坐，念神道之祝詞（のりと），尚有開會、分班討論、自我檢討、篝火（かがりび）儀式等，還要撰寫詩詞謳歌。\n\n\nMost missionaries strongly resisted this forced \"brainwashing session,\" viewing it as \"the most distressing brainwashing event encountered during the war.\" Some expressed that \"it was a 'brainwashing session' completely contrary to Christian beliefs, and not being able to refuse at the time remains a lifelong regret, deeply feeling unworthy before the Lord.\" Only a few missionaries managed to escape using excuses of illness or other reasons.\n\n絕大多數的傳教師非常排斥這種強迫式的「洗腦會」，認為「此鍊成會乃是在戰時我們所遇到的最痛心之洗腦事件。」也有人表示：「這是一種完全違背基督教信仰的『洗腦會』，當時未能拒絕，至今每次回憶至此，深感愧對上主，成為終身憾事。」僅有少數傳教師藉口身體病痛或其他理由而得以脫身。\n\nConsidering the content of the training sessions, there was undoubtedly a significant conflict with Christian beliefs. However, through the Education Bureau, the Governor-General's Office conducted comprehensive spiritual indoctrination under the guise of the \"Christian Service Group,\" leaving individual clergy with little room to object. The speakers were polite and courteous, not forcing the participants to worship Shinto, but attempting to merge religious doctrines by emphasizing that \"Christianity and Shinto do not conflict; the concept of God in Shinto is also a Trinity. The greatest God is called 'Tenchu Omikami,' whom the Japanese do not worship but leave an empty seat for in the center. This God is the 'Yahweh' of Christianity; 'Amaterasu Omikami' came to earth as a human and bestowed the Japanese imperial lineage, and there is another God equivalent to the 'Holy Spirit' in Christianity.\" This arbitrary misinterpretation was difficult for Taiwanese Christians to accept.\n\n從鍊成會的項目觀之，無疑的大大抵觸基督教信仰，但總督府透過文教局，以「基督教奉公團」的名義進行全面的精神教化，個別神職人員的確很難有置喙的餘地。鍊成會的講者斯文、有禮、客氣，不強迫學員敬拜神道，但企圖將宗教的義理加以揉合，強調「基督教和神道並不衝突，神道的神觀也是三位一體的神；最大的神叫做『天中御主神』，這位神，日本人並不敬拜祂，只是留著祂的空位在中間，這位神就是基督教所稱的『耶和華』；而『天照大神』是來到世上成為人，傳賜日本皇統的神，另外尚有一位神，是等於基督教所說的『聖靈』。」此一任意曲解，臺灣基督徒難以接受。 \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\n**(1) General International Diplomatic Relations**\n\n\nA. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident: In 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out. In response, the Japanese government sought to consolidate national power, launching a series of national policies such as the \"National Spiritual Mobilization Movement\" and the \"New Order Movement,\" based on social indoctrination. The Governor-General's religious policy evolved from initial \"indulgent tolerance,\" through mid-term \"systematic improvement,\" to \"religious control\" during the wartime period. As militarism rose, Japan's attitude towards Christian countries and Christians became increasingly hostile. Western religions in both Japan and Taiwan were introduced by foreigners, thus when the Japanese government formulated laws, they considered both diplomatic and religious aspects. \n\n\nDuring the expansion of the war in 1941, the Japanese government adopted a \"diplomacy first, religion second\" approach in handling the presence of foreigners. Spain, due to its neutral stance, saw its Dominican clergy not deported but still monitored, with restrictions on their residence and requirements to support the war effort and align with national policies. In Taiwan, most foreign Christian personnel from \"enemy countries\" such as Britain and the United States were expelled, forcing Taiwanese Christians to become self-reliant and autonomous.\n\n（1）一般國際外交關係\n\nA.盧溝橋事變：1937年，盧溝橋事變爆發，日本政府為集結國力，遂以社會教化為基礎，推展一系列的「國民精神總動員運動」、「新體制運動」等國策。總督府的宗教政策也從初期「放任溫存」、中期「制度整備」進入戰爭時期的「宗教統制」。軍國主義抬頭時，日本對基督教國家及基督徒的態度漸漸轉為敵對。日本國內與臺灣的西方宗教均係外籍人士引入，因此日本政府制訂法令時乃同時考量外交與宗教的層面。1941年戰事擴大之際，日本政府採取「先外交後宗教」的順序處理外籍人士的去留。其中，西班牙因保持中立，所屬的天主教道明會的神職人員未遭遣返，但仍被監視、限制住居，被要求協力戰爭、配合國策。在臺灣，屬於「敵國」英、美的外籍基督教人士絕大多數遭到驅逐出境，臺灣基督徒不得不自立自治。\n\n\n**(2) Diplomatic Relations with Christian Countries**\n\n\nThe term \"Manchuria\" refers to the Kwantung Leased Territory established in 1905 (later known as the Kwantung Bureau) and the territory of Manchukuo established in 1932, following the Mukden Incident in 1931. In other words, it encompasses the three northeastern provinces during the Qing Dynasty or the nine northeastern provinces in early Republican China. Due to colonial rule, Taiwan had connections with Manchuria, which is about 2,000 kilometers away. According to statistics, there were approximately 5,000 Taiwanese people in Manchuria, and the life stories of nearly one-fifth of them are gradually being uncovered, shedding light on this obscure piece of history.\n\n\n（2）基督教國家外交關係\n\n所謂「滿洲」係指1905 年成立的關東州（後稱關東廳）、1931 年九一八事變隔年（1932）成立的滿洲國之疆域。換言之，即清代的東三省或民初的東北九省。臺灣因殖民統治之故，乃與2,000 公里之遙的滿洲有所關聯。根據統計，在滿的臺人約有5,000，其中近五分之一的生命故事漸被知曉，使這段隱晦的歷史露出一線曙光。\n\nSome of the Taiwanese people who had experiences in Manchuria had church backgrounds. The development of Christianity in Manchuria was similar to that in Taiwan, with both being influenced by 19th-century overseas missions and initially facing the clash between Western culture and local traditions. In Manchuria, the Presbyterian Church was predominant. British missionary William C. Burns arrived in 1867, followed by the Irish Presbyterian Church in 1869, and the Free Church of Scotland in 1872. In 1891, these two missions merged to expand their work, establishing presbyteries and synods by 1907. By 1925, they had joined the National Assembly, and by 1941, the Manchurian Presbyterian Church had nearly 300 churches with over 30,000 believers, making up about half of the total Christian population in the region.\n\n曾有滿洲經驗的臺灣人，其中不少具有教會背景。而滿洲的基督教淵源和臺灣發展類似，時間接近，背景都是19 世紀的海外宣教，初期也都面臨西方文化與本地傳統的碰撞。滿洲以長老教會為主，1867 年英國宣教師賓惠廉（William C. Burns）的足跡抵達，1869 年愛爾蘭長老教會入滿，1872 年蘇格蘭自由教會繼之，1891 年兩差會合併開拓，1907 年陸續設立中會和大會，1925 年加入全國總會，到1941 年滿洲長老教會已近300 間，信徒三萬多人，約佔整體基督教之半。\n\nTaiwanese Christians who went to develop in Manchuria were mostly middle-class individuals, particularly in the medical field, as well as in business and academia. This phenomenon was related to colonial policy. At that time, Japan actively recruited professional and technical personnel to develop new territories, and Taiwanese people possessed a pioneering spirit. In Manchuria, they ranked just below the Japanese, above the Manchu, Han, Mongolians, and Koreans, and faced fewer restrictions than they did in Taiwan. Notably, despite their upward social mobility, Taiwanese Christians did not become arrogant or self-important. Instead, they practiced their faith and used their professional skills, especially medical knowledge, to help the local people. As a result, Taiwanese doctors gained a high reputation in Manchuria, earning Taiwan the nickname \"Island of Doctors\" and \"Great Immortals Island.\" This was in stark contrast to the Japanese colonizers, and it earned the respect and recognition of Manchurian society.\n\n赴滿洲發展的臺灣基督徒，大多是中產階級人士，尤其是醫學領域，還有實業、學術界人士，此一現象與殖民政策相關。是時，日本積極招募專業技術人員前往新天地發展，而臺人也甚具拓荒奮鬥之精神，在滿洲僅次日人，位階在滿、漢、蒙、朝鮮之上，受到的箝制比在臺島為少。可貴的是，臺灣基督徒雖有社會階層的上升流動，但不因此而驕矜，極少自視甚高，反而實踐信仰，用專業技術尤其醫學知識來幫助當地人，使得滿洲的臺灣醫師的聲譽極高，臺灣還因此被稱為醫師島、大仙島，受到滿洲社會的肯定，與日本殖民者形成鮮明對比。\n\nHowever, after the war, Taiwanese Christians with experience in Manchuria faced significant challenges. Their years of service were not recognized, and they faced the threat of being judged as \"traitors.\" Consequently, most people concealed this part of their past, and related information is sparse and difficult to find. Even those fortunate enough to return to their homeland encountered a hostile political environment. The stigma of being associated with \"Manchukuo\" was not politically acceptable. In summary, the unique temporal and spatial circumstances profoundly influenced the life stories of these Christians, leaving a deep imprint from their Manchurian experiences and the legacy of colonialism.\n\n然而，戰後有滿洲經驗的臺灣基督徒，非但年資不得列計，還要面對「漢奸」審判的威脅，故大多數人都隱藏這段過去，相關資料也零散難尋。縱使幸運回到故鄉，但等待他們的，卻是險惡的政治環境，因為「滿洲國」的烙印，並非政治正確的一端。要之，在特殊的時空處境，基督徒的滿洲經驗和殖民遺緒深刻影響他們的生命故事。\n\n\n**(3) Nationalist Conditions in Domestic Society**\n\n\nDuring the Japanese colonial period, the Governor-General's Office consistently employed discriminatory and unequal policies. However, it is undeniable that under their administration, Taiwan gradually transformed from a traditional society, achieving relative stability in its political, economic, cultural, and educational environments. From the mid-1930s, Taiwanese Christians experienced a series of revival movements in both the southern and northern regions due to the expansion of the church, accumulating many achievements and forward-looking momentum. This led to a significant increase in faith identity. Influenced by this, Christians generally adopted a proactive mindset, believing they had a responsibility towards the development of both the church and society. They sought to advance both and began to learn from the Japanese experience in church governance. As a result, the church's advocated goals of self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance were achieved earlier than expected due to the changing times. The pursuit of \"evangelizing for the nation\" and realizing the ideals of the Kingdom of Heaven took a significant leap forward.\n\n（3）本國社會的民族主義狀況\n\n日治時期，總督府的殖民統治一貫採取差別、歧視的手段，但不可否認的，臺灣在其治理下，漸次從俗民社會脫胎換骨，政治、經濟、文化及教育環境相對穩定。自1930年代中期，臺灣基督徒由於教勢的拓展，南、北都經歷一連串的奮興運動，累積許多成果與前瞻的動力，信仰認同獲得一定程度的提高。受此影響，基督徒普遍秉持積極進取的思想，認為自身對教會與社會的發展負有責任，應同時謀求教會與社會的「進步」，並開始吸取日人治理教會的經驗。其結果，教會所提倡的自養、自傳、自治三大目標，因時局的轉變而提前實現。「傳道報國」實踐天國理想的腳步，向前大步跨越。\n\n\nDuring this period, as international relations changed and tensions rose, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office implemented a series of social indoctrination movements. These aimed to increase the productivity of rural communities, improve hygiene, promote the use of the Japanese language, foster reverence for the gods and the emperor, and enhance living conditions. The social indoctrination measures promoted by the government were in line with Japan's national policies, organizing, utilizing, and controlling the people. Besides advocating for industrial and economic revitalization, these measures also had a strong spiritual and lifestyle improvement aspect.\n\n此一時期，臺灣總督府隨著國際關係改變，局勢漸趨緊張、進而實施一連串社會教化運動，以提高農村聚落經濟體的生產力、改進衛生，加強普及日語、敬神尊皇、生活改善為項目。官方推動的社會教化措施係配合日本總體國策，對人民進行編組、利用與支配，除提倡產業經濟振興之外，更呈現出濃厚的精神運動與生活改善的性質。 \n\n\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Taiwan launched the \"Kominka Movement\" to align with Japan's \"National Spiritual Mobilization Movement.\" This movement inherited the essence of social indoctrination, representing a series of \"imperial citizenization\" measures implemented by Japan in colonial Taiwan. The Kominka Movement continued the key points of social indoctrination, emphasizing the frequent use of the Japanese language, mandatory shrine worship, family worship of the \"Jingu Taima,\" and the promotion of the Japanese lifestyle. From 1940, it further encouraged the \"changing of names\" to reinforce the cultivation of the Japanese spirit. In education and culture, it banned Chinese language courses in schools, abolished Chinese columns in newspapers, prohibited traditional operas, reorganized temples, and improved the main halls of Taiwanese households to eliminate Han Chinese influences. Governor Kobayashi Seizo explicitly declared \"imperial citizenization, industrialization, and the establishment of a southern advance base\" as his three principles for governing Taiwan.\n\n1937年中日戰爭爆發，為配合日本本土「國民精神總動員運動」，臺灣展開「皇民化運動」，承接社會教化運動的內涵，可謂日本在殖民地臺灣所推行一連串「皇國臣民化」的措施。皇民化運動延續社會教化的要項，加強日語常用、強制參拜神社、家庭奉祀「神宮大麻」、推行日本生活樣式，1940年起更鼓勵「改姓名」，強化日本精神涵養。文教方面，禁止學校漢文課程、廢止報紙漢文欄、禁止傳統戲曲、實施寺廟整理、臺人家庭正廳改善等，企圖去除漢民族色彩。小林躋造總督亦明白揭櫫「皇民化、工業化、南進基地化」為其治臺三原則。 \n\n\nThe Kominka Movement impacted all levels of society, covering various aspects of colonial life. The Sino-Japanese War brought colonial Taiwan into a wartime regime alongside the mother country. To secure Taiwan's strategic position, the Governor-General's Office sought to assimilate Taiwanese people into true \"imperial subjects,\" instilling in them Japanese patriotism and a spirit of sacrifice. Clearly, the Kominka Movement had a profound impact on the daily lives of Taiwanese people, including Christians.\n\n皇民化運動幾乎影響社會各個階層，涵蓋面之大，觸及殖民地生活的大小細節， 而中日戰爭使殖民地臺灣隨著母國進入戰時體制，為扼守臺島重要戰略位置，總督府試圖同化臺人成為真正的「皇國臣民」，使臺人具有日本國民之愛國心和犧牲精神。 顯然的，皇民化對臺人的日常生活影響甚大，基督徒亦不例外。 ",
