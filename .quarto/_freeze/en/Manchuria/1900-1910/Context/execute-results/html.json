The sidelining of the anti-foreign faction at court rippled throughout the country, such that many of the formerly anti-foreign “mandarins” that had been problematic for or oppressive of missionaries were either replaced or adopted a very different tone. The overall relations between state and missions became cordial or even helpful, but this was without a change in the legal framework. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nThe period started with the Boxers, which is a fairly clear indication of social hostility. However, it is worth qualifying that despite their anti-Christian/anti-foreign rhetoric, there were many motivations behind actual violence. There are numerous reports of people using the occasion to settle grudges against neighbors and employers. One of a late-Qing coal mine being destroyed by Boxers sounds like a typical case of luddite anti-technology violence, except for the fact that the perpetrators were themselves former miners, most likely motivated by a grudge against a former employer. I suspect that this sort of occurrence was behind a great deal of violence that on the surface looks like straightforward anti-Christianity.\n\n\nWith the suppression of the Boxers, social hostility no doubt remained, but it was no longer as easily expressed, especially through violence. There are occasional cases of former Boxers attacking or being mobilized to attack Christians, but in the latter case, the impetus came from a disaffected local official who used them as his personal goon squad. \n\n\nOn the contrary, the growth of Christian numbers and the Protestant “Manchurian revival” attest to a much greater acceptance, or at least to the new acceptability of expressing support in public. (DuBois 2017) This support extended beyond the religion itself to greater willingness to make use of allied institutions such as pharmacies and schools.\n\n\nAs with officials \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nThe military defeat of the Qing, followed by the disaster of the Boxer uprising (and the need for foreign troops to help put it down) made clear the state of the power vacuum in the country, notably in Manchuria, where Russia and Japan fought for supremacy in 1904-5. \n\n\nNotably, although Russia was a Christian country, missionaries were anything but optimistic about what Russian victory would mean for the missions. Missionaries praised the orderly behavior of the Japanese side’s troops, and were more confident in the place of Christianity in a modern, Japanese run or administered Manchuria.\n\n\nThe rise and fall of the Boxers also ushered in a new era of common purpose among certain levels of the foreign community, at least in Manchuria.\n\n\nSomewhat ironically, as the Qing had now displayed its loss of de facto control over the region, it was during this period that Manchuria was finally brought under direct central control, with the three former commanderies now being made into provinces. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nDuBois, Thomas David.
