He was thus in Jilin (city) at the outbreak of the Boxer violence, which reached both Manchuria VAs in June of 1900. The next month he and two priests (the entirety of the mission) sought refuge at the Russian (not sure what it was, sources call it a “colony”) at Guanchengzi (Changchun) and from there followed the evacuation of civilians towards Russian territory and eventually on a circuitous water route through Harbin, Vladivostok, Japan and finally back to the Manchurian port of Yingkou and eventually by train back to Jilin, where the new church had indeed been destroyed.  \n\n\nIn the aftermath and using indemnities paid by the Chinese government, Lalouyer began an aggressive period of construction in Jilin. In 1903, the town consecrated the Sacré-Coeur church in Jilin. Followed soon after by the foundation of Catholic villages Saint Joseph and l'Etoile de la mer near the newly founded town (remember that this is all a frontier region) of Tongken. He also enlarged the small seminary in Qiqihar.\n\n\nFélix Choulet M.E.P. 1850-1923蘇\n\nBorn in Chambéry, France, in 1850. Joined the M.E.P. in 1877 and ordained as a priest in the order in 1880.\n\n\nChoulet arrived in Niuzhuang via Shanghai in 1880 and worked for a few years at the Chaling seminary, where he also studied Chinese language. He spent three years in charge of a large district in Liaoning, bordering Jilin on the north and spanning Korea to Mongolia east to west.   Following this, he was again placed in charge of a seminary and a church district, where he proved able an able administrator especially talented at finding funds for construction projects. \n\n\nIn 1900 Choulet was placed in charge of Niuzhuang and was in the process of rebuilding the church building when the Boxer violence broke out. Choulet learned piecemeal of the deaths of Guillon, nine priests and thousands of Chinese Catholics, as well as the looting of church buildings and residences, to the point that “there was no church, residence or school in the entire mission and most of the Christians have their houses burned or demolished.” (Biography: https://irfa.paris/en/missionnaire/1466-choulet-felix/)\n\n\nIt was in this condition that he was appointed VA of Southern Manchuria in 1901. He painted a bleak picture of the mission “We have a foothold in around ten stations. We still have, at the port of Newchanwang, two churches and an oratory: that is our entire fortune. Everywhere else, we are established on the domain of others. The Seminary occupies a rented house, and it is in houses belonging to pagans that our orphanages are installed.” (Biography: https://irfa.paris/en/missionnaire/1466-choulet-felix/) In 1901 he went to Beijing to discuss compensation (with the French legation) from the Chinese government, returning in 1902 with optimism for a new period of expansion and rebuilding. (The post-Boxer optimism was shared across missions). The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 was another period of uncertainty for the missions, but the Japanese victory left Choulet optimistic, as he was convinced that Japan was a better partner than Russia. \n\n\nProtestant missions\n\n\nDugald Christie 1855-1936\n\nChristie was born in Scotland in 1855. He received his qualifications as a doctor and surgeon in 1881. The following year he went to Mukden as a medical missionary and opened the Shengjing Clinic that among much else specialized in cataract surgery (which was mobilized as a metaphor for seeing the light of Christ). For the next 30 years Christie ran the clinic and worked towards opening a full medical school; with funds from Scottish and Irish presbyterian churches, the Chinese government and local people, the clinic became a (teaching) hospital and in March 1912 Christie became the first Principal of the Mukden Medical College. This was the first foreign medical college to be opened in northeastern China. \n\nChristie retired in 1923 and died in Edinburgh in 1936. \n\n\nThomas C. Fulton, 1855-1942\n\nBorn in Northern Ireland and educated at Queen’s College, Belfast. Fulton arrived to Manchuria in 1884 and stationed at Yingkou. Typical of his generation, he spread his efforts over a wide area, never spending much time in one place, and instead concentrating on opening as many stations and churches as possible. In 1899, he joined the staff of Union Theological College, Mukden, and spent most of the rest of his missionary career in theological education. He retired in 1941 and died the following year. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\nAs previously, the two main organizations in Manchuria were the Catholic and Protestant missions. Of these the Catholic underwent some redistricting during this decade, while the latter welcomed new sources of foreign support and branched out into new social organizations. \n\n\nCatholic missions:\n\n\nTwo events followed soon after the 1898 division of the Manchuria VA into north and south  vicariates (Mudken and Jilin): the decimation of the Boxer violence and the period of growth in the immediate aftermath.  The former included the violent death of Bishop Guillon, VA of Mudken, loss of life and property by thousands of Chinese Christians in both districts, and the destruction of nearly all Church property in Mudken and the as yet far smaller VA of Jilin. The latter was a period of rapid expansion, fueled by funds from the Boxer indemnity and by the disgrace of the anti-foreign faction at court, and the relative silencing of anti-foreign voices more generally across society. Both Catholic and Protestant missions expanded during this decade.\n\n\nPopulation figures (See 1930-1939 file for entire chart) show a decline of about one quarter of the (baptized) Catholic population between 1899 and 1900.\n\n\nProtestant missions:\n\n\nLike the Catholics, the Protestant missions underwent a violent contraction, followed by a period of effusive growth. The latter was likely larger than the rebirth enjoyed by the Catholics, as it was fueled by the “Manchurian Revival” in the late part of the decade. \n\n\nThe Boxer violence was less pronounced for the Protestant missionaries, most of whom sought refuge in the foreign ports or overseas. The number of Christians killed is not given, most likely because the missionaries themselves did not know, especially considering the weak organizational structure of the Protestant Christian community. Nevertheless, there was significant loss of property, including Christie’s small hospital, which was completely destroyed.\n\n\nThe post-Boxer recovery was also a time of institution building. The Protestant missions completed work on the Union Theological College, which had been started in 1900, and on the medical school\n\n\nPolitical allies:\n\n\nThe category of pro-Christian organizations can now include friendly officials within the government. Although missionary sources do not mention specifics, the universal hostility of the pre-Boxer period has shifted such that some local officials (notably in the anti-Christian stronghold of Hulan) are visibly friendly to the missions. Whereas in pre-Boxer sources, local officials are universally hostile, whether due to personal antipathy, fear that the Christians would serve to welcome a coming invasion, or weakness in the face of popular agitation, here they are shown to be more mixed. While there are still anti-foreign officials, including some who   incite violence using former Boxers, there are also some like the magistrate of Hulan, who demonstrate support by welcoming the return of the missionaries in a public setting with the pomp of office. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nThe decade that started with the Boxers initiated a significant period of institutional growth as the Christian missions renewed their work with a renewed sense of purpose, a more friendly (or at least less overtly hostile) political setting, and increased resources coming from home and from the Boxer indemnity. \n\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the Boxers left both missions in a state of shock and disarray. By their own accounts, much of the work of previous decades was disrupted if not destroyed. This was particularly true of the physical infrastructure of schools, churches and dispensaries. The loss of life was significant, but generally regarded as a trial, possibly one sent by God, to test and strengthen the new church, and one in which any suffering would be amply rewarded in Heaven. (Both missions made frequent comparisons to the martyrs of the early Church)\n\n\nThe Catholic mission was physically destroyed. Physical destruction included the burning of the church and residences in Mukden and the smaller, much more recent start on a church in Jilin. It is not mentioned whether there was damage to other physical infrastructure such as the seminary in Chaling, which leads me to suspect that these assets were not harmed. The Protestant mission had a much less permanent physical presence, renting instead of owning property for schools, chapels and dispensaries, and the physical damage was less severe. \n\n\nBoth emerged from the period energized and flush with resources, and both embarked on a period of building. The Catholic missions rebuilt the destroyed church in Shenyang. The Protestant missions completed work on the Union Theological College (Boyd 64), which had been started in 1900, and on the medical school.\n\n\nThe Protestant church also entered what it called the Manchurian Revival. Beginning with a spontaneous revival meeting in Liaoyang during Spring Festival of 1908, this movement was replicated up and down the railway over the next few months. The Manchurian Revival was part of a global movement, one that followed a spike in global revivalism, including in Wales (1904–1905), Pyongyang (1903) and across the Anglophone world over the previous decades. The Manchurian Revival did replicate a global phenomenon (coming slightly later than revivals in Ireland, the United States and New Zealand, among others), but the effervescence of the movement was fundamentally a spontaneous reaction to the new sense of opportunity and optimism. \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\nThe main doctrinal issue encountered by both Catholics and Protestants was how to respond to the Boxer violence on the one hand, and on the other, to the period of opportunity that followed its suppression.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, the Catholic missionaries saw it as their role to stay with the Manchurian church, while the Protestant missionaries were more willing to leave China or to seek refuge in an armed port like Yingkou. While the actual actions of missionaries did differ from this exaggerated difference (for example, Lalouyer, long term VA of Manchuria, newly installed as VA of Jilin fled to Japan, while many Protestant workers were indeed killed at their posts), the difference between the two did reflect a profoundly dissimilar philosophy regarding the role of foreign missionaries in the Chinese church. The Catholics regarded the missionaries as shepherds, and aimed through the provision of sacraments and social services to build complete and essentially self-sufficient Catholic communities. This vision is reflected in the preference for Catholics to reside in close proximity, to intermarry, and to raise children in the faith. The role of the priest as a spiritual center and the church building as a physical center reflected this image of the Catholic communities as islands within a pagan sea.  \n\n\nIn contrast, the Protestant missionaries always regarded themselves as a fleeting presence that would ignite the fire of faith and then leave the Chinese church to stand on its own. For this reason, and the fact that many missionaries arrived as couples or complete families they were more willing to flee when the need arose and view the Boxers as a test of faith for the Chinese believers to pass through on their own. Behind this belief is a further assumption about the nature of conversion. While the Catholic mission favored the model of raising children within stable Catholic communities, the Protestants idealized the model of Pauline conversion, a sudden, heartfelt transformation driven less by knowledge or training than by the direct calling of the Holy Spirit. \n\n\nWithout wanting to portray it as a matter of doctrine, the difference is still visible in the aftermath of the Boxers, as the two missionary communities compared notes concerning each other’s respective flock. Both Catholic and Protestant publications emphasized the steady faith of their own converts, while accusing the other of apostasy in the face of difficulty. Catholics were accused of promoting formulaic faith and relying on material benefits (especially help in lawsuits), while Protestants were accused of inflating their numbers by accepting anyone who expressed a fleeting desire to become Christian.  For different reasons, each accused the other of seeking quick wins and promoting shallow faith.\n\n\nAlthough the hostility between the two groups did die down somewhat, the difference in their mission methods and ideals remained evident in the period of expansion following the Boxer suppression. The Catholics used this time to rebuild institutions, including literally rebuilding destroyed church buildings. The Protestant world, both missionary and Chinese Christian, was swept up in a decade of revival. \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nAmong the violent anti-Christian movements of this decade, it is difficult to find anything resembling a leadership structure. As a phenomenon, the Boxers themselves were famously leaderless, and the period of violence in Manchuria would seem to bear that image out. No sources give any indication that the movement was directed by any individual or that it had any sort of geographic center. From which instructions or strategy emanated. The only people who are identified are occasional county-level officials (“mandarins” in the sources) who had previously maintained cool relations with the missionaries, and used the outbreak of violence to “let fall the mask” (in the words of one French mission) and encourage the Boxers from behind the scenes. The rare instance of open hostility during the previous decade reached a violent peak during the few months of Boxer activity, notably in the county of Hulan where three Catholic missionaries were killed. That county would later emerge as a Catholic stronghold after that particular official was replaced.\n\n\nLater and shorter-lived outbursts of localized violence would follow this same pattern, often at the instigation of a local official who was able to direct violence against Christians. \n\n\n(Note that I use the term “Boxers” as a shorthand. It is clear that the actual violence did include the Boxers in their “classic” form, but also a variety of opportunists such as demobilized soldiers, who used the occasion to loot or extort Christian villages, or simply to settle existing scores. If anything, the “Boxer” violence was a precursor to the subsequent decades of “bandit” lawlessness that would engulf the region.)\n\n\nThere was some resentment from specific communities such as doctors, especially in the aftermath of the plague of 1910. This will be mentioned in the coming decade. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nAs discussed in question 3, most anti-Christian activity during this decade should be sourced to or channeled through the Boxers, including small bursts of violence that took place years after the fact.  As such, the Boxers themselves are the umbrella for the period, but who are they? Mission sources emphasize the frequent two-way migration between southern Manchuria and Shandong/Zhili, meaning that anything happening on the North China Plain would quickly be brought north. Other religious movements were known to travel this route, such as the anti-Christian Zaili rebellion that erupted in Rehe in 1890.\n\n\nPolitical support for the Boxers in Manchuria is difficult to pin down, in part because the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5 had already weakened the chain of military and civil command across the region. Troops are shown acting in conjunction with the Boxers, or at least not opposing them, but I cannot say for certain if that represents orders or a breakdown of discipline. Later events are more clearly attributed to hostile local officials who took the opportunity to “remove the mask” of civility and openly attack the Christians.\n\n\nThe aftermath of the Boxers saw a general decrease in anti-Christian activity, if not sentiment, since small-scale events recurred over the remainder of the decade. Sources describe these as being the work either of former Boxers, abetted by hostile local officials, or by similar groups “secret societies and Boxers in all but name” who were motivated either by old grievances or the desire for plunder. \n\n\nOn the whole, I would characterize the shifting and inchoate anti-Christian sentiment of the period as more mood than movement, and certainly nothing that could be definitively tied to a movement or individual. \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nOverwhelmingly the most important event of the period, or of the decades that preceded or followed, was the Boxer Uprising. This event reached Manchuria, in the summer of 1900 and was put down within a matter of months. That specific event was in a sense carried by settlers    or sojourners from the Boxer heartland in Shandong and Hebei, the source of Manchuria’s largest number of migrants, but more fundamentally, it was just one especially violent iteration of themes that were already present in the Zaili rebellion ten years earlier, and that would continue to pop up in much more muted forms later. \n\n\nEvidence from Manchuria confirms that the event was more complex than the story usually told. Missionary reports (as well as official sources) do not dwell on the mystical elements of Boxer lore and instead present it as fairly standard instance of collective violence that was armed and often involved participation of Qing troops. One recorded instance involved the burning of a coal mine by miners who had been sacked. In another, Boxers and Qing troops attacked a village using repeating rifles, while the village itself (mixed Christian and non) had only shotguns.  In other words, this was not the mysticism-driven event that it perhaps started out as in Shandong. There was however clearly violence against Christians. Guillon was killed inside the church, which was burned and sacked. The French mission lost seven missionaries and numerous native clergy, and an unspecified number of native Christians (who were widely scattered in villages). The numbers are unclear because there was no chance to gather information between 1898 and 1903. However, in those two years the mission’s own count of Catholics is 25000 (for the undivided VA) and 17,161 (17,000 in south and 10,161 in north), respectively. I suspect that the rise in the number of Christians in these figures represents the beginning of the uptick in conversions in the aftermath, rather than an attempt to undercount casualties, which must have been high.\n\n\nThe aftermath of the Boxers saw the rapid decline of the anti-foreign faction at court, and as a ripple effect, through lower levels of officialdom and into ordinary society. Both Protestant and Catholic missions report a conspicuous warming of local attitudes towards the Christian presence, officials and police coming to call on missionaries and the like. (Notably in Hulan, which had been a stronghold of anti-missionary sentiment and site of the murder of three French missionaries) Yet within this generally warmer atmosphere, there were still unfriendly officials, including ones such as (Southern Manchuria 1904, 1906) who according to reports incited violence against local Christians by recruiting demobilized Boxers. These sorts of officially-encouraged attacks were however significantly less frequent than in the previous decade.\n\n\nAlso worth noting the Catholic-Protestant rivalry seems to have calmed down during this decade. At any rate the language (e.g., referring to each other as heretics) used in missionary publications is less inflammatory, and although there is still a sense that the other was derelict in the face of the Boxers, there is no further mention of lawsuits or coercive diplomatic measures taken against the other group. Both Catholic and Protestant now describe relations (especially personal relationships) as cordial, if still separate, but some backbiting did still occur in internal publications ",
