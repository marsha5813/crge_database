He arrived in Manchuria in 1908. From 1908-1920, he was placed in charge of a series of far-flung churches. In 1920, he was named Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of Northern Manchuria, and in 1923 the sole Vicar Apostolic.  \n\n\nDuring the 1920s, Gaspais oversaw the significant expansion of the Catholic Church, in terms of converts, institutions, and territory. These successes were despite the declining state of internal security, which created significant practical difficulties for communication. In contrast, Gaspais seemed to maintain good relations with public authorities, a talent that would continue to serve him in the future. \n\n\nAs Japanese influence grew throughout the decade, Gaspais came to view Japan not so much as an aggressor as a guarantor of safety, preferable to the predations of bandits and especially important as a bulwark against the baleful influence of the Soviet Union. These early experiences shaped how Gaspais would deal with the formation of the Japanese client state of Manchoukuo during the subsequent years. \n\n\nBishop Jean-Marie Blois, MEP, 1881-1946\n\nBorn in Nantes in 1881 and ordained to the MEP in 1905. Arrived in Mukden 1905 and placed in charge of church construction and work as parish priest. Returned briefly to France in 1919 to take up position as director of Paris Seminary, but was subsequently brought back to China in 1921 as VA of Mukden.\n\n\nDespite the atmosphere of political and military uncertainty, Blois was concerned during this decade with institution building. Achievements in this regard include the French-Chinese college, which was founded in 1923 and subsequently handed over to the Marists, and a smaller school for catechists that opened in 1924. He also sought to expand the mission beyond the MEP, inviting Catholic missionaries from Quebec and the United States to take up territories that were later detached from Mukden. \n\n\nBlois also oversaw the internationalization of the Catholic mission, using land granted from Japanese Christians in Fushun and Dalian/Dairen to build churches for the foreign (Japanese, Korean and European) Catholic communities. Although new church construction was prohibited after 1927, Dalian was able to rebuild the Francis-Xavier parish church into a such a community, served by a Japanese-speaking missionary priest. (I am not sure about Fushun) \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\nThe growing size and complexity of the Manchurian Catholic church prompted a number of divisions during this decade: \n\n\nYanji, the heavily Korean region adjacent to the Korean border along the Yalu River was made a Prefecture Apostolic in 1928. A Prefecture Apostolic is a designation specifically created for evangelization. It precedes the formation of a Vicariate Apostolic, which is erected to nurture a fledgling church. Yanji was given the designation of Vicariate Apostolic in 1938. \n\n\nQiqihar was erected as a “sui iuris” (self-governing, i.e., independent) mission in 1928. This sort of designation is for an area with very few Catholics or one that is under persecution, I suspect that the meaning here was the former, but cannot say precisely why the decision was made to separate the region in this way. By way of context, Outer Mongolia was given the same designation in 1922, so my suspicion is that what was being intended was to protect the small but growing church in Jilin by removing the burden of ministering Qiqihar. Qiqihar would be named a Prefecture Apostolic in 1939.\n\n\nFrom the two VAs of Mukden and Jehol (Rehe), the new VA of Sipingjie (Szepingkai) was created in 1929. Unlike the previous two divisions, which this was the result of the growth of the church in this area. This region would be administered by the Canadian-born Bishop Joseph Lapierre (MEP), who took up his post in 1930.\n\n\nCatholic estimate the entire Christian (certainly to mean Catholic) population of Manchuria at 60 thousand. In 1920, there were four religious communities: Changchun, Harbin, Xiaobajiazi, and Hulan. \n\n\nMissionaries from the Quebec Society of Foreign Missions arrived in 1925. They were followed by priests of the Society of Foreign Missions of America (Maryknoll) in 1929.\n\n\nDuring the 1920s, Korean settlers began arriving overland from Korea into Jilin. The timing of this exodus represented a push factor of land poverty and Japanese repression at home (particularly for Christians following the unrest of 1919), as well as a pull factor of relatively open farmland in Jilin and a market for high-yield flooded field (Japonica) rice, a crop that Koreans knew much better than the local Chinese farmers, and which had a growing demand in Japan.  Sources mention that there were initially very few Catholics among these Korean settlers, and that there were plans to send someone to Korea to find a catechumen to preach the Gospel among them.\n\n\nProtestants\n\nThe Protestant Union remained under its existing structure, both in terms of its constituent mission groups and of its relation to the larger organization (Synod) based in Shanghai. Sources emphasize that the number of Christians was consistently growing, but give no numbers, most likely because they did not themselves have a way of counting a congregation that was intended to grow organically under its own power. The rise of nationalism and desire to increase Chinese ownership over the church prompted the Protestants to lower the profile of their social mission. This trend would accelerate under the Japanese in the subsequent decade. \n\n\n. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nCatholic sources emphasize the good political relations enjoyed during this period. As stated in the annual report from 1922, “We could not flatter ourselves to have the sympathy of the civil authorities and military, but it is right to recognize that demonstrations of hostility are rare and that in several circumstances, we profited from a rather benevolent neutrality.” \n\n\nAnother describes a Catholic ceremony in Changchun presided over by Bishop Lalouyer, and attended by numerous Chinese and international notables: Lépissier, the French Consul to Harbin, a French member of the East China Railway technical council, the Japanese Consul (of Changchun, presumably), the “Chinese General in charge of Changchun” [sic], the prefect, the chief of police, the first two judges of the court, and several members of various administrations. Assuming that few if any of the assembled dignitaries were themselves Catholic, this was a display of political support. A similar scene is described at a procession in Harbin, with the city’s Polish population turning out in large numbers.\n\n\nThe state of the Catholic Church in (1898) compared to 1922\n\n\nCatholic population (6,556) 27,000 [I believe this figure is baptized only]\n\nIndigenous priests (3) 16\n\nSeminaries (1) 2\n\nSeminary pupils (12) 41\n\nReligious Communities (1) 4 [it is my understanding that these are nuns]\n\nChurches (14) 73 \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\nI could not find anything resembling a doctrinal issue specific to this period.\n\n\nThe two previously discusses questions: whether to increase the pace of indigenization (the call for greater indigenization was particularly pronounced amongst Catholic clergy) and how to square the “imperialist” nature of mission Christianity with growing Chinese statism / nationalism remained in evidence.  The Protestant Union mission was at the forefront of this, with a 1926 statement that mission workers was simply “on loan” to Chinese churches, which retained autonomy. It was subsequently decided that the location and work of foreign missionaries by assigned by the Chinese Church itself.\n\n\nThe question of how to respond to Japan’s increasing presence in the region was not yet significant. The Protestants did tend to view Japan with greater suspicion than did the Catholics, in part because the conflict with native Protestants had already (1919) emerged in colonial Korea, although there was as yet no significant criticism of Japan in the Protestant missionary sources. Catholic express a clearer view that the Japanese presence was a force for progress, and a necessary counterbalance to the rise of Bolshevist infiltration from the South or from the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAlthough not doctrinal issues, this difference does reveal differing attitudes towards political pastoralism, i.e., the long-term presence of missionaries and the depth of long-term political and cultural influence that the two missions envisioned leaving in the region. \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nNone to speak of.\n\n\nConsidering that we are only a couple of decades away from the Boxers, it is safe to assume that missionary writers would have been very sensitive to any potential threat. \n\n\nYet even sources that occasionally mention that a student or local official had some harsh words to say about the Christians, no names are given, and there is no follow up that would indicate a particularly irksome individual or organized anti-Christian movement. For the latter, please see below. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nAs indicated, there was no mention in the sources of an organized anti-Christian movement. There were, however concerns that such a movement could develop over time. In the eyes of mission writers, this future threat would come from one of three sources:1. Energized Guomindang governance:\n\nCatholic sources from this decade contain passing mentions about the “spirit of independence” growing among catechists, as well wariness of anti-foreign / anti-Christian sentiments from local officials (anecdotally, these officials often seem to come from the South, including in previous periods) \n\n\nAlthough less frequent or violent than those further south, outbreaks of anti-foreign sentiment were often precipitated by events elsewhere, such as the 1925 shooting of protesters in Shanghai. The Protestant Synod in Shanghai offered to relinquish extraterritorial rights for its missionaries, and the Manchuria mission issued a statement in sympathy with the protesters and Chinese national aspirations. In 1927, local authorities banned any new construction of a school, church or dispensary. In 1931, they forced the closure of the Catholic Franco-Chinese College, which had around one hundred students in Shenyang. This school had been the site of significant nationalist agitation.\n\n\n2. Communism:\n\nThere is some concern of Communism, either in the form of hostility from the Soviet Union or infiltration from the South. Notably, the latter is associated (in the sources) with radical elements in the Guomindang, and secondarily with Sun Yat-sen’s sanmin zhuyi ideology.\n\n\n3. Public disorder:\n\nThe most consistently-mentioned threat was the lack of order. Fed by demobilized or deserter troops, gangs of bandits controlled large swathes of countryside, attacking travelers and occasionally villages. Foreigners and Christians were singled out the extent that they were perceived as a high-value target, rather than being driven by anti-foreign sentiment. \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nNo specific movements.
