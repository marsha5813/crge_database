Because the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Manchuria was not yet recognized as a diocese, but rather as an Apostolic Vicariate (essentially a diocese in training), the head of each jurisdiction was first named a de jure bishop of a defunct diocese elsewhere in the world. This titular appointment was purely a formality in order to give the appointment the rank of bishop. I do not add them here, but they do appear in official biographies. The official title of a de facto bishop of a Apostolic Vicariate is an Vicar Apostolic. In 1898, the Catholic jurisdiction was split into Manchuria and South Manchuria.\n\n\nBishop Emmanuel-Jean-François Verrolles: 方濟各 / 吳樂爾 (1805-1878)\n\nBorn in Bayonne, France, in 1805. Ordained in 1828 and joined the Société des Missions Etrangères in 1830. Verrolles’ entire missionary career was spent in China. From 1831-1837, he was a mission priest in Muping 穆坪, located in the far west of Sichuan. In 1838, he was placed in charge of the new Apostolic Vicarage of Manchuria and Mongolia, later changed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Manchuria after Mongolia was returned to the jurisdiction of the vicariate of Beijing. Seeking a physical home for the new mission, Verrolles purchased a piece of land in the village of Bajiazi 八家子 near Tieling 铁岭 for the construction of a church and presbytery. Bajiazi already had a few hundred Catholics and would remain one of the key concentrations of Catholics in Manchuria. A second church at Yangguan 阳关 would serve as his residence.\n\n\nVerrolles traveled twice to Europe to seek political and papal support for the new mission. Beyond resources, he sought to ensure against the further erosion of territory of the sort that had placed Mongolia under the jurisdiction of Beijing. Verrolles was well received by Pope Pius IX as well as in the French court, having been offered an arch-bishopric by King Louis-Philippe and receiving an annuity of three thousand francs from Prince Louis-Napoleon.\n\n\nVerrolles oversaw the transition to the new era following the treaties of Tianjin and Beijing (1858-1860), which gave missionaries the freedom to travel and preach openly in China. He sent priests out across Manchuria, particularly to non-Han areas of the north as well as into Siberia. His successes invited conflict with the more recently-arrived Protestants, who made him the subject of satirical articles in the local press. Verrolles died in 1878 and was interred in Yingzi (Yingkou). Following his death, his residence at Yangguan was repurposed as a seminary.\n\n\nBishop Laurent Guillon 紀 M.E.P. (1854-1900)\n\nBorn 1854 in Aix-en-Provence, France. Ordained in 1877, having already joined the Société des Missions Etrangères while still in seminary. Guillon departed for Manchuria in 1878 and studied Chinese language at the seminary in Yangguan. He was struck ill twice, once by smallpox in 1880, and again by typhoid in 1882.\n\n\nIn 1889, Guillon was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Manchuria. He succeeded the brief tenure of two predecessors, Constant Dubail, M.E.P., and Louis-Hippolyte-Aristide Raguit, M.E.P., each of whom had died soon after taking office. An energetic administrator, Guillon quickly grew the number of Catholics and Catholic mission in the territory. Besides sending priests on rounds to deliver sacraments to far-flung Catholic villages, Guillon placed particular emphasis on developing Catholic social institutions such as orphanages, schools and dispensaries. This strategy aimed to counter the successes of the Protestant missions, with whom Catholic relations were strained. Guillon oversaw the Catholic mission response to the 1894-1895 Sino-Japanese War, the first phase of the ongoing military crisis that would engulf the region. \n\n\nIn 1898, Guillon petitioned successfully for the region to be divided into two Apostolic Vicariates, Southern Manchuria and Manchuria, corresponding roughly to the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, respectively (Heilongjiang was still aspirational, it would in 1931 become the Apostolic Prefecture of Qiqihar, essentially an aspirational Apostolic Vicariate designated specifically for evangelization). Guillon remained Vicar Apostolic of Liaoning, which at the time of separation had 23 missionaries, 8 indigenous priests, 115 catechists, and 20,050 Catholics.\n\n\nGuillon held the position of Vicar Apostolic at the time of the Boxer Uprising. He remained at his post in Mukden and was killed during an assault on the cathedral in 1900.\n\n\nBishop Pierre-Marie-François Lalouyer M.E.P. 藍祿葉 (1850-1923)\n\nBorn in 1850 in Rennes, France. Joined Société des Missions Etrangères in 1871 and was ordained priest of the society in 1873. Later that same year, he arrived in the port city of Niuzhuang and was dispatched by Emmanuel Verrolles to begin study of Chinese language at Yangguan. In 1874, Lalouyer was given a position in the Mukden seminary, and in 1889 was placed in charge of the seminary at Chaling. In between these two positions, he was head of the parish of Mukden and sent to a district on the western coast of Liaodong.\n\n\nIn 1897, Lalouyer was named coadjutor along with Guillon of the Apostolic Vicariate of Manchuria and sent to the northern city of Jilin, where he purchased a piece of land for a house. This was in preparation for the subsequent (1898) division of Manchuria into two Apostolic Vicariates, Southern Manchuria and Manchuria, with Lalouyer being placed in charge of the former.\n\n\nProtestant missions:Protestant leadership came from the Scottish and Irish missions, later joined by British, American, and Swedish missions. The Scottish and Irish joined in 1885 into the Presbytery of Manchuria, often simply referred to as the Union, which would remain the umbrella organization for all Protestant efforts moving forward. \n\n\nWilliam C. Burns (1815-1868) \n\nBurns was the pioneer Protestant missionary to Manchuria. \n\nAn energetic evangelist, Burns was deeply connected to the revivalist movement, having experienced a moment of personal inspiration at a revival meeting during his early twenties that convinced him of a personal calling from God. Burns’ career had already taken him through his native Scotland, Britain, Ireland and Canada before he was sent by the English Presbyterian Church on mission in China in 1847. Burns first encountered the Chinese language on his shipboard journey to Hong Kong, eventually becoming sufficiently proficient to pen a Chinese translation of the 17th–century Christian tract, the Pilgrim’s Progress. Like his evangelical wanderings, Burns travelled frequently rather than remaining within one mission station, gradually moving north from Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou and Beijing before settling in the Manchurian port town of Niuzhuang in 1867.\n\n\nIn that year, Burns appealed to the English Presbyterian Mission board to add the region to the work of the mission. That successful appeal took on the additional tenor of a dying wish, as Burns died after a brief illness the subsequent year. Subsequent missionary writings portray Burns and his call to mission in highly reverential terms. (Boyd, 53-54)\n\n\nDugald Christie (1855-1936)\n\nThe first and most important medical missionary to Manchuria.\n\n\nBorn in Scotland, Christie trained at the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, receiving both qualifications in 1881. The subsequent year, he was sent to Manchuria, volunteering to leave the more comfortable foreign enclave in the port city of Niuzhuang and instead move upcountry to the city of Mukden (Shenyang) where he opened a small dispensary that by 1884 had grown into a twelve-bed hospital. In his memoir, Christie describes significant resistance to Western medicine, including patients who assumed nefarious intent from the drugs stocked in the clinic, fears that he attributed to rumors started by Chinese doctors. Christie describes an incident during the Sino-French Tonkin war of 1884 in which a French Catholic priest visited the clinic, igniting rumors that visitor’s long black robe concealed a child which was to be sacrificed for its eyes and heart. Despite these setbacks, the clinic continued to train local Chinese assistants and in 1892 enrolled its first class of medical students as the Shengching (Shengjing, another name for Shenyang) Medical School. (Thirty Years in Moukden, pp. 5-6)\n\n\nHaving established this foundation, both the hospital and Christie’s career as a medical missionary would later take off in more dramatic form in response to later public health crises, particularly the outbreak of pneumonic plague in 1910.\n\n\nJohn Ross (1842–1915) 羅約翰\n\nRaised in a Gaelic-speaking area of northern Scotland, Ross served several local churches before leaving for China under the United Presbyterian Church in 1872.\n\n\nRoss was based initially in Yingkou and later moved to Shenyang, where he became active evangelizing to the local Korean community. He would complete the first Korean-language translation of the New Testament that was widely used in Korea, as well as Korean language primers and an English-language history of Korea for use by later missionaries.\n\n\nRoss was known for being an institution-builder, raising funds for the Dongguan church outside of the then city walls of Shenyang. That church was a center of the Korean Christian community in Shenyang. It was damaged in the Boxer violence, but subsequently rebuilt. In his writing, he encourages a mission strategy based on the acceptance of Chinese religions and practices. He returned to Scotland in 1910 and died in 1915.\n\n\nWang Jingming, aka “Old Wang” (c. 1840–1885) \n\nDescribed in contemporary publications as the first Chinese evangelist in Manchuria, “old Wang” was both an actual figure and an embodiment of the Protestant ideal of successful conversion. According to John Ross, Wang was “the first baptized, the first preacher set apart, and the first elder ordained by the writer.” (5)\n\n\nAccounts of Old Wang’s life are fairly stylized, the longest being in a pamphlet by John Ross. This account presents Wang as a sincere convert, not always sophisticated in his understanding of the Christian teaching, but with a burning desire to preach to any who would listen (and some who would not). Matching well the Pauline model of heartfelt spiritual transformation, Old Wang embodied the ideals of Protestant mission in Manchuria. Wang was born in a village near Beijing, given a basic education but insufficient land to make a living as a farmer. He worked in various trades in Jilin and Niuzhuang, where he took up smoking opium. In 1873, Wang happened upon a copy of a gospel which intrigued him to regularly come and hear the preaching and catechisms of the Protestant mission. He soon converted and remained insatiable in his desire to understand the scriptures, a “diligent student of the truth, though not a remarkable bright one.” For the remainder of his life, Wang was an unquenchable evangelist, distilling the essence of the gospel in his heart and relating it in a manner that the poor in his own country could understand and appreciate, a process that marked the transition from mission to native church. In 1884, Wang became ill and after a period under the care of the mission. He died at roughly the age of 40.\n\n\nA similar life trajectory of a figure nicknamed “Blind Chang” also appears in tracts of the time. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\nChristianity in Manchuria was both young and highly centralized, meaning that for most of its early history, the church was synonymous with Catholic and Protestant missions. Of these, the former was more tightly organized under a foreign mission presence, while the later   emphasized initiative by native converts, aka indigenization. \n\n\nCatholic mission:\n\nCatholic mission during the period of initial Jesuit encounter during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had made some impact on a handful of scattered villages, but apart from extremely infrequent contact with missionaries in Mongolia, these early communities spent the next few centuries largely cut off from the Church. Later missionaries would occasionally mention visiting a village with a long since dissipated Christian presence, with only the physical remains of a cross as testament.\n\n\nThe resurgence of formal Catholic mission presence in Manchuria only occurred in 1838, when the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong (Liaodong) was established out of the larger territory of the Diocese of Beijing, which at the time included most of China. This large territory was placed in the charge of the Société des Missions Etrangères, commencing with its inaugural head, Bishop Emmanuel Verrolles. (The MEP is/was founded in 1658 as a specialist in Asian mission. It was active throughout East Asia, particularly in areas of French interest.) Two years later, the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong was changed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong and Manchuria, representing the loss of the northwestern areas of Gansu (later renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Shanxi) and the formation of a new mission under the Belgian Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Scheutist) in Mongolia.\n\n\nManchuria would remain under this Vicariate Apostolic until 1898, when in response to the growth of the Church and the unwieldy size of the territory it covered, the Apostolic Vicariate of Liaotong and Manchuria was divided into the Apostolic Vicariates of southern and northern Manchuria, centered in Mukden and Jilin, respectively. This division came at the recommendation of Bishop Laurent Guillon, who remained the head of the Mukden Apostolic Vicariate until his death in 1900. In 1898, there were an estimated 25,000 Catholics in the entire territory of Manchuria, of which 17,433 were in Southern Manchuria.\n\n\nGrowth of Catholic population (all of Manchuria)\n\n\n1885: 12,618\n\n1887: 13,025\n\n1888: 13,126\n\n1889: 13,943\n\n1890: 14,220\n\n1892: 15,075\n\n1893: 15,825\n\n1894: 16,844\n\n1895: 18,061\n\n1896: 19,819\n\n1897: 22,149\n\n1898: 25,000\n\n\nState of Catholic mission\n\n1873: 1 Bishop, 12 European missionaries, 2 indigenous priests, 30 baptizers, 1 community of indigenous nuns: 60 sisters \n\n\n1891: 14.352 baptized Christians divided into 21 Christian districts, 2 seminaries, 42 boys’ schools, 46 girls’ schools, 16 orphanages, 8 indigenous priests and 42 seminary pupils.\n\n\nApart from the formal Church hierarchy, Catholic villages often led a highly independent existence, especially during this early period.  Dispersed through the countryside, Catholic villages were ministered mostly by indigenous priests. The more remote of these would only see a priest on a few occasions throughout the year. \n\n\nProtestant Union\n\nThe earliest Protestant missionary in Manchuria was William C. Burns, who arrived in Niuzhuang in 1867. Although Burns died one year later, his arrival still had the effect of placing Manchuria on the Protestant map, his death serving as a rallying call for later generations of missionaries. Through the 1870s, the Protestant presence in Niuzhuang remained small, consisting of a chapel and dispensary, and one or two missionaries of the Scottish United Presbyterian Mission. Baptisms were relatively few and hostility towards foreigners occasionally broke into violence. In 1885, the Scottish mission and the Irish Presbyterian Mission joined in the Presbytery of Manchuria, often simply referred to as the Union, initiating a period of takeoff. (These missions had already been active in the British Isles. The Irish mission had a foundation in Gujarat. The Scottish mission only worked in China, with their efforts focused on Manchuria.) By 1893, the mission reported a total of 896 baptized Christians. With the 1894 outbreak of war between China and Japan, all missionaries were ordered to leave the interior and seek shelter in the port, a decision which Protestant sources portray as allowing the native church to stand on its own, but by Catholic sources as the Protestant missionaries abandoning their flock. Regardless, the Protestant mission grew rapidly in the subsequent years aided by the influx of new missionaries and the reputational boost provided by the mission’s medical and charitable work, particularly during the period of Sino-Japanese War. Over 2,500 were baptized in 1899 alone, and the total membership of both missions of the Manchurian (Protestant) Church included 19,646 members, as well as 251 churches, chapels and houses of prayer (Boyd 63) \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nApart from the founding of institutions, there were few major movements or events during this period. For both missions, it was a period of slow growth and foundation building. \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\nBehind the overriding question of how to missionize this vast, newly-opened territory most quickly and effectively lay a deeper problem of theological and practical correctness.  By most accounts, the most pressing issue was not Chinese beliefs, which by all accounts were expected to fall away sooner or later, but rather the pernicious influence of other Christian missions who could potentially lead Chinese converts to error.  Expressed in the generally cool relations between the Catholic and Protestant missions, this division was considered by both missions to be of highest long-term importance.\n\n\nThe rivalry between the French Catholics and Scottish and Irish Presbyterians included issues of geopolitical and national pride, but was also the difference between two distinct philosophies of mission. Concerning the former, both French and British political legations in Beijing did at times attempt to claim the mantle of speaking for the interests of all Christian missions, regardless of nationality. The latter was a thornier problem. Missionaries often spoke of their rivals in terms as “heretics” and took particular pride in claiming converts from each other. Relations were not always hostile: Catholic and Protestant clergy would occasionally visit each other on festive occasions such as the opening of a new school or departure of an old missionary returning to Europe, but hostility was sometimes expressed openly, as when a Protestant missionary penned a newspaper article attacking the moral character of the French bishop, Verrolles.\n\n\nThe most significant differences were theological. Specific to mission field, the two had differing perspectives on the nature of (true) conversion, and the role of the missionary clergy. Simply put, Catholic practice aimed to create coherent and distinct villages of coreligionists, led by clergy, with institutions that would raise children in the faith and crucially provide the sacraments. (Of note: Catholic baptism of the dying, notably children, was a high sacramental priority that I doubt was viewed favorably by the Protestants.) Although the indigenous clergy had grown in number and more than proven themselves in the face of persecution and the hardship of ministering to villages separated by extremely long distances, there was as yet no serious discussion of creating a Chinese Church that was free of European leadership. The model of the Catholic mission was very much the Church Universal, highly structured, hierarchical, and centrally-led. \n\n\nIn contrast, the Protestant missions idealized the model of Pauline conversion, the individual, heartfelt calling by the Holy Spirit epitomized in model converts like Wang Jingming (Old Wang). Mission itself consisted of preaching on street corners and in humble churches, while the provision of services such as dispensaries and hospitals was a social gospel philosophy of winning converts through moral example. While the Catholics kept tight control over who amongst their ranks could minister and where, the Protestants prized the independence of the converts to preach in whatever way they saw fit, taking the lack of sophistication not as error but as evidence of heartfelt sincerity. This ideal is seen in the life stories of Protestant missionaries such as William Burns, who are portrayed (in positive terms) as so burning with the Holy Spirit that they started preaching right off the boat, regardless of their ability with the Chinese language. The elevation of sincerity (over doctrinal sophistication) as a primary virtue is replicated in the effusive praise given to converts like Old Wang.\n\n\nThe difference between the two mission strategies became clear as the Boxer violence loomed. The Protestant missionaries largely sought refuge in the port city of Niuzhuang, leaving the Chinese Christians to face what they understood to be a test of faith (often portrayed as divinely sent.). In contrast, the Catholic priests made a point of remaining with their churches, both congregation and building, which in some cases also provided physical defense to the community. In subsequent accounts, each made a point of emphasizing the lack of faith and willingness to apostatize by converts on the other side. This rift would remain throughout the next few decades and would signify the very different vision that each mission had for Christianity in China. \n\n## Anti-Christian Leaders\n\nFor reasons discussed in 6. below, I can find no named leaders that emerge as enemies of Christianity. \n\n\nRather, the groups that appear as most likely enemies are social types. These include conservative townspeople and villagers, officials who are either personally set against Christianity/foreigners or simply want to remove those who would create the conditions for violence. Protestant sources note that Manchu elites in northern cities like Qiqihar and Jilin tended to be more reflexively anti-Christian. Those with a direct conflict include doctors who were in competition from the mission dispensaries and local educated elites (such as sishu teachers), who proclaimed that the Christians were here to replace Confucius. \n\n\nZailijiao, a religious teaching that erupted into violence in 1892, is credited with an inchoate hatred of Christians and foreigners, but it is not at all clear how this was related to their teaching, whether it represented a variation of apocalyptic violence, or if it was simply a precursor of Boxer attitudes.\n\n\nEach of these types of anti-Christian groups had a common element: they were disorganized and leaderless. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nThere was little organized resistance to Christianity at this time, the key word here being organized. Rather, resistance to Christianity came from a variety of sources, nearly ubiquitous but generally small in scale. Missionary sources mention a handful of political officials as being particularly and often violently anti-Christian. \n\n\nThe most notable case of official persecution was in the northern town of Hulan, where missionary Louis Conraux was captured and tortured by local officials during the 1880s. (I believe this was in connection to the Zaili revolt). This area would later (post-Boxer) become a Christian stronghold. In another earlier case from 1888 the Catholic orphanage near Haicheng was attacked, the two missionaries driven out “with rifles and lances” and 25 of the 53 children killed.\n\n\nHowever, while some such officials were indeed motivated by dislike of foreigners of Christians, others had no particular thought beyond preventing the outbreak of violence against the foreigners who after 1871 were increasingly willing to take up matters with the foreign legations. Facing fears of a Russian invasion, one such official in “San-sing” (in “Amur” province, assume they mean Heilongjiang) imprisoned local Christians to convince them to recant their faith. When that was unsuccessful, he ordered them to leave, even offering to recompense them for lost lands. When the Christians replied that they would leave only in response to an official decree, the official wrote one and ordered soldiers to banish any Christian from the territory, and to punish anyone caught harboring or selling land to a Christian. (Guillon 1891).\n\n\nOf particular note is that clerical (Buddhist and Daoist) religions did not seem to be particularly anti-Christian, at least not consistently or as a matter of principle. Protestant sources report that Muslims tended to be more friendly to the missionaries, for example being willing to engage in commerce when Han Chinese would not. \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nThe main event that could be characterized as anti-Christian was the Boxer Uprising, which will be discussed in the subsequent decade. \n\n\nBefore that event there were tremors of lesser size and magnitude that in retrospect displayed elements of the violence that was yet to come. \n\n\nMost anti-Christian sentiment was expressed at the small scale, either small acts of non-violent hostility to the missionaries, or individuated acts of violence against converts within families or communities. Missionary accounts treat the former as a daily occurrence attributed to hatred of foreigners and/or their religion. They included such acts as refusing to sell or rent land to foreigners, harassing foreigners while preaching or while going about more mundane affairs, or spreading rumors about evil intentions/magic. Often those with the most vocal opinions also had a direct conflict of interest, e.g., Confucian students or doctors of Chinese medicine. On a few occasions threats did erupt into violence against missionaries, such as in 1885 when a missionary doctor was surrounded and captured by soldiers who suspected him of murdering children for their eyes and hearts (for use in making medicine). (Boyd 59)\n\n\nIndividuated violence towards converts was frequent. The common pattern was that a Christian individual or family was targeted by neighbors or family members with a demand to recant. Often the hostility was due to a perceived threat to collective security or practice, e.g., refusal to participate in family sacrifices or contribute to the maintenance of a village temple, or else the fear that harboring a Christian in their midst would bring misfortune or divine punishment. In missionary accounts, attention is naturally given to those who refused to apostatize and were tortured, exiled or killed. In their depictions of violence against converts, both Catholic and Protestant accounts clearly mimic the images of early Roman martyrdom.\n\n\nThe following account is typical:\n\n\"a Christian, head of household, and a man of wealth and influence, had apostatized publicly five years ago, to the great sorrow of his parents and all of the Christians. To worsen his scandal, this unhappy man hosted a great meal to which all the surrounding pagans were invited. He exposed, in front of them, the plaques of the ancestors all spread out, along with the images of the false gods and all sort of Chinese superstitions; he commanded the family to honor these plaques and images, and they entreated him adore only the true God from now on. Prayers and supplications were useless and could not bring back the man back to his senses. His son, seven years old, taught secretly by his Christian mother and other relatives, refused to burn incense to the ancestors on New Year's Day, and nearly wore the crown of martyrdom, with his own father as the torturer. In sorrow, the neighbors had to tear the man off of his son, his hands bloodied, saying that he wanted to offer his son in sacrifice.” (Annual bishop report, Guillon, 1892)\n\n\nSpikes in violence were prompted by a few sources. Rumors about the nefarious intentions of foreign medicine (both Catholic and Protestant missions maintained dispensaries) were common in Shenyang and on a few occasions nearly broke into violence. External events such as the Tianjin massacre of 1871 and rumors about an immanent invasion of China by Russia during the 1880s prompted a general air of suspicion and rumors of retaliation in which all of the foreigners would be slaughtered. Such claims (often expressed as a threat directly to the missionaries) rose and fell in conjunction with other rumors about political intrigue.\n\n\nThe first bout of organized violence was the Zaili revolt of 1892. This revolt was a precursor to the Boxers in that it was not a focused and clearly-led rebellion but rather a loosely coordinated snowball of localized violence that turned partly against the missions and Chinese Christians with same sorts of claims of ridding China of the foreigners and their malevolent magic that would later characterize the Boxers. \n\n\nThe letter of Guillon (1892), then VA of Manchuria, describes the Zaili massacre of Christians in Jilin:“an indigenous priest, P. Lin, and hundreds of neophytes had their throats cut with distinction neither of age nor of sex. …  The plot hatched by Tsai-Li-Ti, a sect dominating in Mongolia and Manchuria, had been directed against the Christians in the area of the massacres, but it had burst earlier than its authors would have liked. It was the suddenness of the blow which saved us.” (Annual bishop report, Guillon 1892) ",
