Briefly, religions and religious practices were divided into three groups: correct, illicit, and perverse (the first and last often translated as orthodox and heterodox). In reality, the greatest concern about religion was that it would prove to be a threat to public order, either by inciting violence, or by inviting evil forces from the spiritual realm. Since the early 1800s, Manchuria had begun receiving growing numbers of migrants from the North China Plain, and it was feared that among these migrants were carried the banned religions from that region. These fears were realized in the Zaili (Tsai-li) violence of the 1890s, which was tangentially connected to the group in North China, but only became violent in the northeast region (Shek, 1980)\n\n\nRegarding Christianity specifically, the legalization of mission after the 1872 Treaty of Tianjin, roughly coincided temporally with the opening of Manchuria itself. As such, there was relatively little conflict around illegal mission, as had been found in other places. Indeed, the new wave of missionaries had an advantage in the fact that many of the migrants to the region came from Hebei and Shandong, both of which had deep mission roots, especially in rural areas.\n\n\nIncreasing but parcelized of interest within Manchuria created zones of foreign influence (including settlement) and geographic safe zones for the development of Christianity. Notable are the Russian (here meaning empire, so inclusive of Lithuanian and Polish Jews and Catholics) sphere along the CER (China Eastern Railway, also called the Qing Eastern Railway) and the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) which was initially Russian, later ceded to Japan. Harbin and Dalian (Dalny) developed as key points along these two railways, and would become centers of expat Christianity, albeit generally not a missionary one, as the large Russian Orthodox population in Harbin largely served its own interests in terms of building and staffing churches. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nSocial hostility towards Christians was very real, but not necessarily anti-Christian as much as an amalgam of unfocused anti-foreignism, which also came to include those who associated with foreigners. Missionaries reported a constant drumbeat of low-level hostility from all quarters, being refused a ride in wagon carts, landlords being unwilling to rent, etc. It is hard to know how much of this is attributable to the behavior of the Christians, especially the Protestants, who prized the tactic of street corner preaching. The depiction as simple anti-foreignism does ring true, given that people didn’t seem to distinguish between types or nationalities of foreigners. Fears of a Russian invasion during the 1880s prompted rumors of a massacre of all foreigners (reported across missionary sources), supposedly to be sanctioned by the emperor. (Ross 1903)\n\n\nChinese Christians were targeted, both as a matter of principle, and because their refusal to participate in village rites and village activities such as temple building cast them as a divisive presence withing the community. Equally so for individual families, which violently turned against members who converted. \n\n\nThis sentiment was often led by individual scholars or officials, but in the end, it was the response of the Boxers that brought it to a mass movement. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nBy far the most important dynamic was the decline of the mediated power of the Qing to the growing but yet informal influence of foreign powers.  During the late 19th century, the Qing had brought the region under increasingly direct administration, but at the time it was still ruled as military commanderies, creating a relative power vacuum that was easily exploited by neighboring Russia and Japan, and to a far lesser extent by other powers who had an interest in Yingkou.\n\n\nInformal foreign influence coexisted with actual declining Chinese power for some decades, until the outbreak of war with Japan in 1894. This war revealed the complete ineptitude of China’s modernizing military and further destabilized the region with waves of deserting soldiers.\n\n\nThe result was that Japan would make the first land grab of the foreign powers in China, anticipating later war with Russia, and ushering in a new era of direct foreign enclave administration.\n\n\nIt should be noted that Japanese Catholics and the Catholic missionaries in Japan were supportive of this war effort. Japanese Catholics served with unusual valor in the military, and MEP priests blessed troops on the way to the front.\n\n\nChinese nationalism was present but inchoate, consisting largely of aimless antiforeignism and vague hope for reform. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nRoss, John.
