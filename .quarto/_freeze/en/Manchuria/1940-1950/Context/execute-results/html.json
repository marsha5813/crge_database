Social engineering programs and political institutions that were established with some degree of ideological enthusiasm or long-term vision were quickly scrapped in favor of military expediency. This includes the entire legal system, which remained in form, but was in fact bypassed for a system of rule by fiat.  Legal decisions and decrees were still issued but were largely cosmetic. A constitution was promised, but never delivered. Promulgation of new laws ground to a halt. (DuBois 2010)\n\n\nPolicy towards Christianity during the early 1940s consisted of tightening screws on existing regulations for active participation in nationalist events and performance of nationalist sentiment in schools (e.g., keeping a shrine and demanding morning reverence for the two emperors and goddess Amaterasu) but as the wartime situation worsened, the prevailing sentiment was simply to wait out the storm. (Fulton 1967; Han 2005; Wiest 1988)\n\n\nThe late 1940s was substantively different. Although no decrees formally restricting or abolishing Christianity were enacted by the Communists, the sense was that any policies enacted by them would be far more thorough and non-compliance would be more harshly viewed., but again this sentiment was in anticipation of policies that had not yet been enacted. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nI do not see any social hostility from the Chinese population either before or after the defeat of Japan. If anything, my sense is that the Christians (both missionary and Chinese) rode out the storm as best they could. Both the Catholics who stayed and the Protestants who returned were met with gratitude for being wartime allies, and for remaining friends during the worst of the occupation. There was however strong and universal agreement that the era of mission was definitively over. Neither missionaries nor the local church had any doubt on this question. \n\n\nThe hostility that was evident was imported with the Communist movement, and anticipated with their takeover. The final years of the decade saw Christians who had remained steadfast under the Japanese now apostatizing or keeping a distance from the missions in anticipation of what might happen after the widely anticipated Communist takeover. This was reported in both Catholic and Protestant sources.  Simply by virtue of having remained intact under the Manchukuo regime, the Christians were regarded as particularly suspect and de facto traitors by the Communists. \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nThe obvious political dynamic was the Pacific War, which cast the Anglo-American Protestants as enemies of Japan and subsequently as friends of China. Catholics, including American Maryknollers were somewhat better viewed, especially given that the Church itself had (through Pluries instanterque) now definitively cast itself as a non-political actor. (Wiest 1988)\n\n\nWartime Japan itself was not to my knowledge viewed by the Allies as an enemy of Christianity so much as an enemy of civilization. The association with the other Axis powers, and behavior of Japan in Southeast Asia further solidified this image. \n\n\nThe Christian nations of Europe viewed the Communist movement with trepidation, based less on experience than on experience with the Soviet Union. Any guarded optimism that remained at the close of the 1940s quickly dissipated in the first years after the actual takeover. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nDuBois, Thomas David. “Inauthentic Sovereignty: Law and Legal Institutions in Manchukuo.” Journal of Asian Studies 69, 3 (2010): 749–770. \n\n\nFulton, Austin.
