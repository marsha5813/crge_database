In 1951, he was placed under house arrest and briefly imprisoned before being returned to France. Gaspais died in France in 1952\n\n\nBlois \n\nBlois remained in Mukden until his sudden death due to heart failure in 1946.\n\n\nFather Pierre Duhart, M.E.P.  1901-1963\n\nDuhart was born in France in 1901, ordained in 1925 and sent to China in 1926. After a time as a priest in Xiaobajiazi and Hulan, he taught in the seminary in Jilin. In 1936, he was made the parish priest of the Jilin cathedral and (with a break in 1941 to recover from heart problems) remained in that position until 1946, at which time he was named the superior of the seminary and subsequently Pro-Vicar Apostolic of the mission (I believe that this signifies a secondary or administrative position, as Gaspais himself remained Vicar Apostolic). Later in 1946, he was moved to Changchun and placed under house arrest, but was apparently allowed to work in the seminary garden. He was expelled from China in 1952 and remained a professor in the Petit Séminaire de Mesnil-Flin. He retired from that position in 1962 and died the following year. \n\n\nCharles-Joseph Lemaire, M.E.P.  1900-1995\n\n\nBorn in France in 1900 and ordained in 1929, following study in France and in a doctorate of theology in Rome. Lemaire arrived in Jilin in 1931 and held the position of vicar of the Jilin Cathedral. From 1937-1939, he was in charge of the Jilin Seminary, and from 1939 Cadjutor of the Jilin VA. In this capacity, he often stood in for Gaspais, visiting parishes and conducting confirmation ceremonies. In 1945, he was named Superior General of the MEP, a position that placed him in a position to weather the transformation of Asian missions in the postwar period. He retired from that position in 1975 and at the Retirement Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor until his death in 1995.  \n\n\nIgnatius Pi Shushi 1896-1978\n\nBorn in the Catholic village of Chaling in rural Liaoyang and ordained in 1927, Pi spent his most of his adult life in the Church. In preparation for the transition to Chinese-led dioceses, he was chosen as the inaugural Archbishop of Shenyang and ordained in 1949, just two months before the Communist revolution. \n\n\nAlthough outside the scope of this period, Pi would be imprisoned in 1955 and subsequently serve as the head of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church, which was out of communion with the Vatican. In this capacity, he would subsequently consecrate the dozens of bishops who served the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church well into the 1970s. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\nState of the two churches\n\n\nCatholic \n\nIn 1946, Vicariates Apostolic in Mukden and Jilin are elevated to dioceses. More than a nominal change, the change to status of diocese signifies that these districts have shed their tutelary status. These are no longer missionary fields and that they will henceforth be led by bishops. This change took place across China and was the culmination of decades of agitation by native priests for true equality of the Chinese Church in the eyes of the Vatican. \n\nMost foreign priests remained in Manchuria until the Communist takeover, at which point they were placed under house arrest or briefly imprisoned before being repatriated in 1951 or 1952. Chinese leaders of the new Patriotic Church emerged during the early years of the 1950s.\n\n\nProtestant\n\nThe repatriation of missionaries in 1940 and 1941, followed by outbreak of war between Japan and the Allies late that year, left the Protestant church completely defenseless. Schools and hospitals had since been placed under Japanese ownership, and any church service was closely observed by state spies. With the outbreak of war in 1941, any remaining missionaries were placed under house arrest, later, to be transported to Harbin, and finally Japan, from which some were sent home as part of a prisoner exchange. \n\nWith the end of the war, it was clear that the Chinese churches were, in fact, completely independent. A commission that returned late in 1945, found high enthusiasm among Chinese Christians, who had managed to maintain basic educational and medical institutions, even during the Japanese occupation. While a Mukden conference in 1947 did make some preparation to retrain Chinese church leaders, plans were already underway to withdraw mission personnel, and the last missionaries had left by 1950. \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\nThe early half of the decade saw the acceleration of the war, including the entry of the United States. By this point, the Japanese empire as a whole was in the phase of total war, meaning that ideology, state-building or any other concerns had all taken a back seat to resource extraction and complete mobilization of the population. It also meant the expulsion of the Anglo-American missionaries, meaning that only the French Catholic missions were able to continue operation.  Although the latter were operated primarily (but not exclusively) by French priests of the MEP, technically allies with Japan, they were still observed closely by Manchukuo authorities, and often relied on Japanese Catholic intercessors in Manchuria and Tokyo. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nCommunists \n\n## Anti-Christian Events/Movements\n\nDespite the constant hostility from the Manchukuo, Guomindang, and Communist regimes, there was no open anti-Christian movement, as such. By the 1940s, even the formerly sanguine Catholics were aware of the impossibility of working with the Manchukuo regime, and neither Catholics nor the returning Protestants had any enthusiasm for the return of the Guomindang. Both saw the Communists as the greater threat because that group (unlike the Guomindang) was ideologically disciplined and (unlike the Manchukuo regime) was able to force its social policies deep into society. \n\n\nThe dismantling of the missions and hostile takeover of the Church by the Communist regime began in the late 1940s, but did not complete until 1951-1952.
