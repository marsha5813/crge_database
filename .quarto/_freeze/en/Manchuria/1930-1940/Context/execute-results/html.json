The point being that the legal space was still somewhat inchoate. (DuBois 2010) There was direct inspiration for the administration of religion in Manchuria from the Japanese Peace Preservation Law (1937), but this again was not law as such. (Watanabe 1979)\n\n\nThe state of Christianity in Manchukuo closely tracked against events in Japan, although again largely on an episodic level that set political sentiment rather than writing black letter law. As in Japan, Manchukuo Christianity had detractors and supporters, the latter becoming vocal after a 1937 incident in which a group of students at Tokyo’s Sophia University refused, citing religious reasons, to participate in the reverence at the Yasukuni Shrine. This cast the students, and by extension Catholics, as a fifth column within the state, but that argument (and the crisis) was mollified through the intervention of high-ranking Catholics in the government and military. The incident did affect Manchukuo, mostly by deflecting anything similar from taking place there. Catholic missionaries were very keen to avoid a repeat of this incident on their own soil.\n\n\nThe more important legal development came not from the state but from the Catholic Church itself. The 1936 encyclical letter Pluries instanterque, which formally advocated accepting the local explanation and understanding of Shinto ritual in Japan, opened the door to a new Church policy of accepting local religious customs and customs more generally. Of note is the fact that the letter itself was prompted in large part by the potential for the narrowly-averted crisis in Japan to repeat itself in the more complex political setting of Manchukuo. Moreover, as Canon law in this sense respects the idea of precedent, this letter opened the door for far more changes post war. (DuBois 2017; Minamiki 1985) \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nSpeaking specifically about the Manchukuo period, the beginning of the decade saw Japan actively courting the foreign powers in an attempt to raise international support. The unequivocal condemnation of the state by the League of Nations Lytton Commission (which was British-led) came as a genuine surprise to many, and prompted a radical change in attitude, resulting in the state’s increasing isolation and turn to extremism. \n\n\nThis would manifest as a desire to contain the missions, if not expel them. The problem was rarely stated as an ideological clash with Christianity, which the official ideology of the state did not oppose. Indeed, it promoted an ideal of ‘patriotic churches’ under the leadership of the Concordia Association (xiehe hui/kyōwa kai). The guiding myth of the state that its founding was a spontaneous expression by the people of Manchuria was replicated in the ideal that its component pieces would all be drawn to a new patriotic participation. (Chou 1996; Duara 2003) Thus, it was important that religious leaders be shown (in the press and elsewhere) as voluntarily seeking to serve that state as Christian (or other) leaders. It was not a matter of rejecting the religious identity as sublimating it to a corporatist vision. Indeed, the state projected itself as a protector of religion, in contrast to the forced atheism of the Soviet Union or (as they depicted it) Sun Yat-sen’s “communism.” (DuBois 2017; Wiest 1988) \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nWhat should be remembered is that until Japan’s 1931 invasion, and to some degree even thereafter, Japan was widely viewed by most foreigners and even many Chinese as the progressive force in the region. Only with the 1935 report of the Lytton Commission, which unequivocally stated that the Manchukuo state was a puppet of Japan, was this reputational coffin finally closed. From that point, Anglo-American sentiment would turn decisively against Japan and against the Manchukuo project. This would further foster a mutually hostile atmosphere for Protestant missions in the region. \n\n\nPatriotism is hard to gauge, because the creation of Manchukuo prompted an exodus of the most patriotic Chinese elements, including the relocation of Northeast University. (Wang 1988) There was little organized underground activity, as these elements preferred to regroup in areas under Chinese control, first behind the Great Wall, and later to the Southeast. Manchukuo did have its nationalist element, especially the ideologues who arrived from elsewhere in the Japanese Empire. (Duara 2003) The growing thought surveillance amongst intellectuals at the (new) Manchukuo Foundation University and the social engineering projects that picked up speed after the Lytton Report did have boosters, but the direction was less anti-Christian than an increasingly paranoiac mix of anti-Western, anti-Communist, and anti-Chinese. Towards the end of the decade, Protestants were particularly caught up in charges of anti-Japanese sentiment (but were not deported). Especially after the French surrender to the Nazis, the French Catholics were much better able to weather this storm. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nChou, Wan-yao. “The Kōminka Movement in Taiwan and Korea: Comparisons and Interpretations,” in The Japanese Wartime Empire, 1931–1945, ed.
