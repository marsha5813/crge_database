In 1934 Gaspais founded a new seminary in the Manchukuo capital of Xinjing. In 1940, this seminary was handed over to the Assumptionist order for operation. The seminary opened with an enrolment of about 50 students.\n\n\nOn the whole, Gaspais’ attitude towards Japan was cautious. He was by no means a booster for the new state, but was willing to deal with its authorities as the chief representative of the Church (as in a 1934 meeting of Manchukuo religious leaders in Changchun). He is best remembered for his role in advocating for the acceptance of political and familial rites in the lives of Catholics, convincing the Holy See to reverse its centuries-old decision to ban Chinese Catholics from participating in ancestral or Confucian rites (and the definition of the latter as idolatry). This advocacy was in response to increasing role of public rites in the life of Manchukuo, including a legal instruction to maintain a Shinto shrine in classrooms, rites for the Manchukuo and Japanese emperors, and rites for the war dead. It mirrored crises in Japan, specifically one involving students at Catholic Sophia University in Tokyo\n\n\nJean-Marie-Michel Blois, M.E.P.\n\nBlois continued to act in his role as VA of Mukden. He does appear to have been less enthusiastic than Gaspais about cooperating with the new state, but that may simply be a virtue of distance from the new capital. There is no particular evidence either way about his support or condemnation of Japan. His notable achievements during this period consist of 1934 founding a printing house in Mukden to print materials for the Church as it existed under the state of Manchukuo (printers in Hong Kong or China were either unable or unwilling to take on this work). \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations\n\nCatholic\n\nIn 1932, the parish of St. François-Xavier was entrusted to Father Patrouilleau, a missionary from Tokyo. This church was located to the Japanese concession and in the consular district in Mukden and was used by Japanese and Korean Catholics, and Catholic foreigners.\n\n\nUnder the Manchukuo regime, the Manchurian Catholic church was forced to sever relations with the Chinese church and realign themselves to communicate with Catholic authorities in Tokyo instead of those in Beijing. While this did not likely influence personal communication amongst to leaders, it did complicate routine visits and force measures such as the founding of a new Church printing house in 1934, since the church could no longer source its printed materials from Hong Kong or China.\n\n\nBelow are all available statistics for Catholic Church membership in Manchuria. The drop in Mukden VA in 1931 is due to the creation of new districts from what was formerly Mudken territory: Jehol 1929, and Fushun in 1932. These new territories reflect continued growth of Church membership, but create the illusion of a decline between 1927 and 1931. I have not found population data for the two new districts. The same is true for the creation of the sui iuris district of Qiqihar, which was created in 1928 out of the territory of the Jilin VA, creating the same apparent drop in membership. \n\n\n|  | total Catholics | total adult baptisms | Jilin VA Catholics | Jilin VA baptisms | Mukden VA catholics | Mukden VA baptisms |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1866 | 8000 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1873 | 8672 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1880 |  | 341 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1882 |  | 287 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1884 |  | 497 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1885 | 12618 | 351 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1887 | 13025 | 402 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1888 | 13128 | 312 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1889 | 13943 | 988 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1890 | 14220 | 510 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1891 | 14352 | 518 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1892 | 15075 | 535 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1893 | 15825 | 662 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1894 | 16844 | 852 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1895 | 18061 | 1290 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1896 | 19189 | 1529 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1897 | 22149 | 3180 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1898 | 25000 | 4006 |  |  |  |  |\n| 1903 | 27161 | 1748 | 10161 | 1038 | 17000 | 710 |\n| 1904 | 28834 | 3207 | 11562 | 1454 | 17272 | 1753 |\n| 1905 | 30648 | 3016 | 13376 | 1924 | 17272 | 1092 |\n| 1906 | 33737 | 2681 | 14924 | 1718 | 18813 | 963 |\n| 1907 | 37921 | 3212 | 17293 | 2149 | 20628 | 1063 |\n| 1908 | 41481 | 3439 | 19350 | 1709 | 22131 | 1730 |\n| 1909 | 44575 | 3151 | 21167 | 1486 | 23408 | 1665 |\n| 1910 | 47268 | 2472 | 22493 | 946 | 24775 | 1526 |\n| 1911 | 44892 | 2451 | 19028 | 988 | 25864 | 1463 |\n| 1912 | 46624 | 2145 | 20071 | 672 | 26553 | 1473 |\n| 1913 | 48155 | 1830 | 21139 | 650 | 27016 | 1180 |\n| 1914 | 50321 | 2115 | 22406 | 692 | 27915 | 1423 |\n| 1915 | 51158 | 1702 | 23311 | 600 | 27847 | 1102 |\n| 1916 | 53265 | 2976 | 24260 | 645 | 29005 | 2331 |\n| 1917 |  |  |  |  | 30350 | 2780 |\n| 1918 |  |  |  |  | 30428 | 1395 |\n| 1919 | 56708 | 1413 | 26051 | 432 | 30657 | 981 |\n| 1920 | 57212 | 1244 | 26935 | 508 | 30277 | 736 |\n| 1921 | 56415 | 1268 | 27220 | 400 | 29195 | 868 |\n| 1922 | 51276 | 1287 | 22276 | 534 | 29000 | 753 |\n| 1923 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1924 | 52642 | 1221 | 22369 | 581 | 30273 | 640 |\n| 1925 | 64013 | 1047 | 33299 | 612 | 30714 | 435 |\n| 1926 | 54096 | 2761 | 22999 | 2277 | 31097 | 484 |\n| 1927 |  |  |  |  | 31798 | 505 |\n| 1928 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1929 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1930 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1931 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1932 | 48142 | 1275 | 22255 | 560 | 25887 | 715 |\n| 1933 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1934 | 53580 | 2569 | 26797 | 1314 | 26783 | 1255 |\n| 1935 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1936 | 61114 | 3065 | 30619 | 1863 | 30495 | 1202 |\n| 1937 | 61954 | 3097 | 30636 | 1834 | 31318 | 1263 |\n| 1938 | 61147 | 2966 | 31743 | 1988 | 29404 | 978 |\n| 1939 | 62350 | 2438 | 32308 | 1559 | 30042 | 879 |\n\n\nProtestant\n\nThe Protestant churches were forced by Manchukuo authorities to divest any affiliation with the Chinese Church, i.e., the Synod in Shanghai. At the same time, they did remain in communication with and received advice from home boards.  The question of how, and to what degree to acquiesce to Japanese demands, was up to some debate, but on the whole, the decision was made to do as little as possible, while hoping to Weather the storm. Reversing the long-standing policy of seeking to distance themselves from extraterritoriality, it was considered the late 1930s whether to incorporate the missions as a “juridical person,” as per the Japanese demand. Doing so would have allowed the schools to continue to operate, but at the cost of acquiescing to demands for Japanese ideological indoctrination, such as Shinto shrine participation. In 1938, the decision was made simply to leave the educational mission all together. The schools were sold to the Manchukuo government for the sum of 641 thousand Manchurian dollars, which was considered to be a fair price. By 1940, the atmosphere had become untenable, and missionaries were advised to repatriate.\n\n\nAs reported to Synod in 1939, the state of the Protestant church was as follows:\n\n\nChurches: 288 congregations, membership about 30,000, 100 ministers, 250 evangelists.\n\n\nSchools: before official interference with the school system, there were 30 schools, 200 teachers, and over 5000 pupils. \n\n\nHospitals: 14 hospitals, 250 nurses, 50 doctors, including those on the staff of the medical college. \n\n## Christian or Pro-Christian Events/Movements\n\nNot a movement as such, but the incorporation of the Catholic Church into the heavily engineered religious structure of Manchukuo was one that unquestionably would have been perceived as potentially friendly by some. \n\n## Key Theological Issues\n\nJilin VA Gaspais was active in campaigning the Holy See to reverse its centuries-old decision to ban Chinese Catholics from participating in ancestral or Confucian rites (and the definition of the latter as idolatry). This advocacy was in response to increasing role of public rites in the life of Manchukuo, including a legal instruction to maintain a Shinto shrine in classrooms, rites for the Manchukuo and Japanese emperors, and rites for the war dead. It mirrored crises in Japan, specifically one involving students at Catholic Sophia University in Tokyo that just narrowly avoided becoming a full-blown crisis (given the backroom maneuvering for and against the Church within the Japanese government). \n\n\nIn 1935, Propaganda Fide issued the instruction Pluries Instanterque formally not only allowing, but encouraging Catholic participation in civic rites that do not directly contradict their conscience as Catholics, as a duty of citizenship. Importantly, this instruction defined these criteria in subjective cultural terms, reviving in essence the much earlier Jesuit argument that because Chinese culture defines ancestor as veneration rather than as idolatry, that the Church should not impose their own definition on the act.  This decision was prompted most immediately by the threat of political crisis in Manchukuo and secondarily Japan. With the promulgation of Pluries Instanterque essentially creating precedent, the decision was then applied to similar centuries-old crises of perception and definition, such as the Malabar Rites in India and the disallowance of funerary rites in China, these bans being formally rescinded in 1940 and 1939, respectively. Although many priests on the ground had long taken a de facto forgiving stance to local custom, the formal recognition of the validity of local cultural understandings was a sea-change in Catholic policy that opened the door to Vatican II less than two decades later. This change was long in the making, but it was the threat of crisis in Manchukuo (and lobbying by people like Gaspais and bishops in Japan) that prompted action and set the Church on the road to becoming a truly global entity.\n\n\nA second but clearly related crisis concerned the pace of indigenization of the Catholic church, particularly the elevation of Chinese bishops and the transformation of administrative status from Vicariate Apostolic to diocese, that is, from a tutelary to a fully self-determining status. Growing an indigenous priesthood and divesting mission from national interest were already overt priorities of the global Church, as expressed in the 1919 Apostolic letter Maximum illud.\n\n\nYet unlike the question of cultural recognition, the political crises in Manchuria and across China slowed the pace of indigenization because it was felt that keeping the missionary presence would serve to protect the Church from external threats, particularly those of a foreign nature (where diplomatic cover would be useful and necessary). The greater these threats, the more intense the call to keep the Church under what was essentially diplomatic protection (the same logic as colonialism, it should be noted). The rhetoric surrounding indigenization was less about whether the local Church was ready in terms of sufficient faith (this question was largely settled as early as the Boxers), but rather whether the global climate was simply too dangerous for the Church to exist without European protection. Just like colonialism, the latter argument became difficult to support with the outbreak of war in Europe and the 1940 signing of the Tripartite Act that created the Axis. It would subsequently be revised to say that French (Vichy) sponsorship of the Church provided cover because France was now seen by the Axis as a friendly (or at least neutral) power, but would collapse immediately after the end of WWII, with the long-awaited creation of dioceses (headed by Chinese bishops) taking place across China in 1946. \n\n## Anti-Christian Organizations\n\nAlthough not a movement as such, there were both Japanese and Chinese anti-foreign elements in the government of Manchukuo. Generally, these voices perceived Christianity as a recalcitrant bastion of foreign imperialism. Japanese critics were naturally influenced by what was happening in Japan, such as the shrine controversy at Sophia University (a group of student refused to attend ceremonies at the Yasukuni Shrine) However, these are mentioned in very general terms as “conservatives” but were never significant enough to be tied to any individual, much less an identified faction. The Chinese voices were more muted, as the most strident nationalist cultural defenders (and proponents of ideology such as sanmin zhuyi) had more or less been evicted at the creation of the new state. \n\n\nOf the two, the Protestants were viewed with greater suspicion, both because many of the missionaries were British and because Protestant Christians had been active in opposing Japan in Korea (1919) and at least some of the Korean migrants to Manchuria were suspected to have been refugees from that suppression. Already under pressure from the previous decade of rising Chinese nationalism, Protestant educational institutions were cast under even greater suspicion. All schools were forced to replace portraits of Sun Yat-sen with those of the Manchukuo and Japanese emperors. The Protestants were the more vociferous (at least in their internal publications) in their opposition to such policies, but also realized that they were powerless to resist. Sources also describe constant surveillance, summary searches, the constant threat of arrest (for foreigners—Chinese Christians were simply arrested), and occasional rumors that (not wishing to display the same weakness that had allowed the Korean revolt to develop) all Christians were to be executed. In all, the Protestants during this decade seemed to take the tactic of laying low and hoping that the storm would pass. \n\n\nThe Catholics were viewed as more willing partners. This comes in part from the long history of the MEP in Japan (including support during Japan’s continental wars), support from well-placed Japanese Catholics, the fact that most MEP were French (and less antagonistic to Japan) and the work of people like Gaspais to actively court a place for Catholics within the new state. Yet even the Catholics were not free of suspicion. In their private correspondence, the small contingent of American Maryknoll priests noted that they were under constant and not always well-intentioned observation. \n\n\nYet, many among the Japanese leadership saw common cause with the Christians (again, the Catholics especially) as a bulwark against communism and sanmin zhuyi ideology (the two were often equated in the sources). This is in addition to sympathetic Japanese Catholics acting behind the scenes in Tokyo or Xinjing. \n\n\nJapanese-sponsored social/religious groups such as the Red Swastika Society and Concordia Society had a similarly double face, supporting the Christians to the degree that they could be made to fit into the carefully-engineered structure of religion as an expression of Manchukuo national unity, but drawing the boundary at foreign mission (especially Anglo-American Protestants). These were semi-independent organizations that were staffed largely by “true believers” in the Manchukuo project and most often high-ranking members of that government. As such, they mirrored directly state initiatives and rhetoric. \n\n\nOfficially, Christians were one of a few approved religious organizations, similar to the later status of “patriotic” churches in China. Propaganda events featuring religion as an expression of national unity would feature a Catholic priest (usually Gaspais), along with an imam and Buddhist monk (others might be included – the structure was not as normative as the “five religions” in China). I have not seen Protestants participating in these events before or after 1939. ",
