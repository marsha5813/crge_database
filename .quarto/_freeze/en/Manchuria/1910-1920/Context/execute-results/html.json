Official attitudes were generally one of benevolent neglect. The goodwill of previous decade seems to have continued, but not translated into much beyond basic protection. In practical terms, there was no law towards religion, beyond a general sense of trying not to antagonize the foreigners. The greatest threat to the missions was the lack of order in the countryside, a situation that made difficult travel between sites, especially rural preaching and the rounds of ministry to Catholic villages. At the same time, it likely created a greater need for mission public services, such as educational and medical. \n\n## Social Hostility toward Christianity\n\nSimilar to the previous decade, social hostility was muted in this decade. Reports of official hostility were rare, as were cases of individuated violence towards Christians. Local officials continued to either publicly support the missions (making appearances or offering police protection for activities, etc.) or simply treat them with neglect. There was one report of a local officials mobilizing former Boxers to attack a Catholic village, but such instances were rare. My impression is that the higher up the chain of officialdom, the friendlier the reception. Besides not wanting to antagonize the foreign powers, the medical mission, especially of the Protestants, had been instrumental in combatting the outbreak of pneumonic plague that had run through Manchuria in 1910-1912. (DuBois 2014; Wu 1959) \n\n## Geopolitical Dynamics and International Relationships\n\nThe wars of the previous years, combined with the fall of the Qing had created a vacuum in the region that Japan was starting to fill. Both economically and culturally, Japan was still a minor influence of Manchuria’s life, but that role was growing, and notably it was the one most associated with progress. During these years, Japan’s interest in Dalian (Kanto) began to develop, and from there, to reach northward through the South Manchuria Railway, over which it maintained suzerainty that extended to a buffer region a few kilometers along the length of the track. This effectively gave Japan an exclusive development zone reaching from Dalian to Changchun, and Japanese developmental investment, especially through the railway itself, began in earnest. \n\n\nJapan had directly annexed Korea in 1910, marking it as a new form of expansionist power within the region. While this event did not itself prompt migration from Korea, the relative poverty of the North would increasingly do so. While Korean Protestants were particularly prominent the 1919 nationalist conflict with Japan, most overland migrants were motivated by poverty, rather than ideology. Christians were relatively few, and missions regarded the new arrivals as an opportunity.\n\n\nRussia had been effectively sidelined from the region after 1905, and this influence was removed entirely following the revolution of 1917. This event prompted a flood of refugees from across the Russian Empire, including not only ethnic Russians, but also Catholic Ukrainians and Poles. These refugees increased the population of Harbin and became a major feature of that city’s cultural and economic life, but unlike the Christian missions, did not interact significantly with the city as a religious force. (Bakich 2001; Carter 2002; Chernolutskaya 2001)\n\n\nWestern powers were largely on the sidelines, other than as observers. \n\n## Bibliography\n\nBakich, Olga. “Emigré Identity: The Case of Harbin,” in Harbin and Manchuria: Place, Space and Identity, ed.
