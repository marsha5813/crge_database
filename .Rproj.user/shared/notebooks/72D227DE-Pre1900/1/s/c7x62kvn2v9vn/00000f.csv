 이승만 Syngman Rhee  李承晚 

03/26/1875 ~ 07/19/0765

Following Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in August 1945, Syngman Rhee returned to Korea with the full support of the United States under General Douglas MacArthur. Upon arrival, Rhee immediately emerged as a central political figure and expressed his vision for a Christian-based nation. At his first official service at Jeongdong First Methodist Church, he declared his intent to “build a new nation upon the Word of the Bible,” revealing a governing philosophy rooted in Protestant Christian ideals rather than mere personal faith.

Soon after his return, Rhee organized a political base centered on Protestant leadership, forming the Korean National Independence Promotion Association with prominent pastors and church elders such as Lee Yoon-young and Bae Eun-hee. He also forged close ties with U.S. intelligence networks and Protestant figures affiliated with the OSS. During this time, Rhee portrayed communism as synonymous with atheism, strategically aligning anti-communism with Christian faith as a unified national ideology.

In 1948, as the Republic of Korea was established and Rhee was elected its first president, his religious orientation became explicitly embedded in state rituals. The first National Assembly was opened with a Christian prayer by Pastor Lee Yoon-young, and Rhee’s inaugural address included a pledge “before God and the people,” reaffirming the theological legitimacy of his rule. His initial cabinet was heavily weighted with Protestants, reflecting an effort to establish Christian principles at the core of national governance.

This religious inclination also appeared in social and economic policies. Most notably, land reform efforts were interpreted by Rhee as the realization of biblical justice. Article 86 of the 1948 Constitution, which mandated the redistribution of land to tenant farmers, was framed not only as a countermeasure to communist reform but also as an expression of Christian socio-economic ethics—an attempt to embody justice and stewardship through state policy

The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 intensified Rhee’s anti-communist posture and his reliance on Christianity as a moral and ideological pillar. Stories of persecution of Christians in North Korea, including the martyrdom of Pastor Sohn Yang-won and Elder Cho Man-sik, were highlighted to portray Christianity as a defender of national freedom. During the war, Rhee institutionalized Christian influence through the establishment of military chaplaincy and prison chaplaincy systems. He also supported the founding of Christian media such as CBS (1954) and Far East Broadcasting Company (1956) and even modified national rituals by replacing compulsory flag salutes with a “gaze of respect,” aligning with Christian objections to idolatry. However, Rhee’s religious policy extended beyond favoritism toward Protestant Christianity; it also entailed direct intervention in and control over other religions. In the 1954–60 period, the government became involved in internal religious conflicts, exacerbating divisions and using them to assert control.

In Buddhism, Rhee issued the so-called Jeonghwa Yusi (“Purification Edict”) in 1954 during a heated dispute between celibate monks (bigu) and married priests (daechoseung). Although the edict played a role in restructuring the Buddhist order under celibate leadership, it violated the National Assembly’s resolution prohibiting state interference in religion. While some later interpreted the edict as a corrective reform, it also became the origin of prolonged division and violence within Korean Buddhism.

In Confucian circles, Rhee sided with the Nong-eun faction and was nominated as head of the Confucian Association, marginalizing the traditionalist Jeongtong faction led by Kim Chang-sook. This move strengthened his political influence while weakening Confucian autonomy. Meanwhile, new religious movements were often labeled as pseudo-religions or cults, with their leaders arrested—indicating a substantial infringement on constitutionally guaranteed religious freedom.

As Rhee’s rule grew increasingly authoritarian, Christianity was no longer just a foundational ideal but an instrument of governance. His 1952 constitutional amendment to allow direct presidential elections, the 1954 third-term amendment, and the centralization of power around Protestant aides like Lee Ki-boong and Lee Gap-seong illustrated how religion and power were tightly intertwined. However, the 1960 March 15 rigged election provoked nationwide protests, culminating in the April 19 Revolution. Rhee eventually stepped down, declaring he was yielding to the “will of the people.” His resignation marked the end of a political-religious experiment in using Christianity as a state ideology.

한경직 韓景職 Kyung-Chik Han

12/29/1902 ~ 04/19/2000

After the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, Rev. Han Kyung-jik responded promptly with both religious and humanitarian action. In August of the same year, he established the Christian National Salvation Association (기독교구국회) in Busan. This organization provided relief for refugees, supported soldiers, and organized national prayer rallies. For Han, these efforts were not simply emergency responses—they were expressions of a theological conviction that the church must serve as a moral and institutional anchor for the Korean nation in times of crisis​.

Han's work during this period cannot be separated from his central theological and political idea: the Doctrine of Nation-Building through Evangelization (傳道立國論, Jeondo-Ipgukron). First developed in the immediate aftermath of Korea’s liberation in 1945, this concept held that the church—modeled on the representative system of Presbyterian governance—could produce democratic citizens through its evangelistic and educational functions. The more churches were planted, Han believed, the more people would be trained in democratic principles, thus enabling the establishment of a Christian democratic nation. He famously declared that “evangelism is the greatest political movement,” emphasizing the church’s ability to guide national development not only spiritually but also socially and politically​.

In the 1950s, Han Kyung-jik put this doctrine into action, particularly through the development of Youngnak Church in Seoul. The church, founded to serve war refugees from North Korea, became a base for a wide range of ministries, including orphanages, hospitals, schools, and welfare organizations. These activities reflected Han’s commitment to a form of Christian mission that was not limited to preaching but also included the structural reconstruction of society. His theological commitment to serving the poor and vulnerable was deepened during a period of personal illness in the U.S., where he drew inspiration from figures like St. Francis of Assisi and Leo Tolstoy. This influence led him to prioritize social service and compassion as core elements of his pastoral and theological identity​​.

Politically, Han did not remain on the sidelines. In the 1952 presidential election, he played a key role in rallying Protestant support for Syngman Rhee, whom he described as a Christian president. Furthermore, he endorsed Pastor Ham Tae-young for the vice presidency. These endorsements reflected Han’s belief that political engagement was not only permissible but necessary for Christians in Korea. Contrary to the abstract notion of the separation of church and state, Han advocated what might be called a public theology of engagement. As Kim Do-hyung observes, Han saw the church’s participation in politics not merely as a right but as a duty in the face of national and ideological crisis​.

In 1955, Han was elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea, a position that cemented his leadership in the broader Protestant community. From this position, he expanded his influence not only in evangelism but also in education, social reform, and national policy. Throughout this time, anti-communism was central to his theology and public messaging. Based on his traumatic experience in North Korea before his defection, Han viewed communism not simply as a political alternative but as a spiritual enemy—a satanic force that threatened both the church and the nation. In sermons and publications, he often described communism as the “red dragon,” echoing apocalyptic imagery from the Book of Revelation. This theological framing gave moral urgency to the church’s resistance to communism and legitimized its support for South Korea’s anti-communist regime​​.

Han’s anti-communist stance also reflected his alignment with the Christian nationalist movement that emerged during the post-liberation period. Alongside leaders like Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, and Syngman Rhee, he argued that Christianity should serve as the moral foundation of the newly forming Korean state. This belief was articulated most clearly in his 1949 sermon collection Christianity and Nation-Building (건국과 기독교), which was compiled from messages delivered at Youngnak Church between 1946 and 1947. In these sermons, Han contrasted Christian democracy with atheistic republicanism and communism, emphasizing the former as Korea’s best and only option for a just and free future​.

Through these efforts, Han Kyung-jik contributed not only to the physical reconstruction of postwar Korea but also to the shaping of its ideological and moral foundations. His synthesis of evangelism, welfare, anti-communism, and political activism laid the groundwork for what would become the dominant orientation of Korean conservative Protestantism in the second half of the 20th century. His influence extended to right-wing youth movements such as the Northwest Youth Association (서북청년단) and played a role in entrenching Christian anti-communism as a major force in national politics​.

In sum, Han Kyung-jik in the 1950s and 1960s was far more than a pastor—he was a nation-builder, a public theologian, and a moral leader. His thought and actions illustrate a uniquely Korean model of Christian political theology in which spiritual and national redemption were deeply intertwined. His legacy—though increasingly contested in recent years—continues to shape how many in the Korean Protestant community understand the relationship between church and nation.


손양원 孫良源 Yang Won Son

07/07/1902 ~ 09/28/1950

Son Yang-won (1902–1950) was a prominent Christian martyr in Korea, whose life was marked by unwavering faith and sacrificial love. From the Japanese colonial period to the outbreak of the Korean War, he lived among the afflicted, especially those suffering from Hansen’s disease, embodying the gospel through every aspect of his life. His journey culminated in what has been called a ""life prepared for martyrdom."" After Korea’s liberation in 1945, Son returned to the Aeyangwon leprosy sanatorium in Yeosu. For him, Aeyangwon was not merely a medical institution but a community of faith. He lived like family with more than a thousand residents, breaking down social barriers, shaking their hands, eating with them, entering the intensive care units, and even using his mouth to draw out pus from infected wounds when needed. Each day, he prayed, “Lord, help me truly love Aeyangwon,” asking to love them more than his own family. His ministry was not based on pity, but on the incarnational love of Christ made visible. During this time, he traveled throughout Korea to preach at revivals, emphasizing repentance, the return of Christ, and spiritual purity. His messages were not merely words—they were lived sermons. Many testified that they encountered God through his life as much as his preaching.

In 1948, the Yeosu-Suncheon Incident brought Son perhaps his greatest trial: the martyrdom of his two sons, Dong-in and Dong-shin, at the hands of leftist student rebels. In a shocking act of forgiveness, Son rescued the murderer, Kang Chul-min, from execution and adopted him as his son. At a time when the country was gripped by vengeance and political hatred, Son’s act of love and reconciliation demonstrated the gospel’s power to transcend ideology. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, many Christian leaders and missionaries fled south. But Son refused to leave his flock behind. Instead, he held a special service titled “Let Us Die Well,” where he declared, “First is martyrdom, second is martyrdom, and third is martyrdom. Be ready to die well.” He longed to become a sacrificial offering, saying, “If the Lord permits, I wish to become a sacrifice this time.” Despite numerous pleas for him to escape, Son eventually returned alone to Aeyangwon. On September 13, 1950, he was arrested by Communist forces. He willingly gave himself up to protect the leprosy patients, having heard that unless he surrendered, they would all be massacred. During his fifteen days of detention in the Yeosu Police Station, Son continued his ministry. He prayed every morning during re-education sessions, shared his meager meals with weaker prisoners, and insisted on taking punishment in place of others. He preached tirelessly in word and deed, even under extreme duress.

On September 28, 1950, while being transferred to Suncheon, he was executed in a peach orchard in Yeosu. According to witnesses, he encouraged his fellow prisoners to pray until the end and even preached to the guards escorting him. His mouth was crushed—reportedly because he kept proclaiming the name of Jesus until his final breath. Son’s death was not that of a mere anti-Communist. While some have labeled him a nationalist or anti-Communist martyr, such ideological interpretations fall short of the depth and integrity of his witness. His life and death were not politically motivated but were deeply rooted in the imitation of Christ. He forgave, loved, and reconciled across enemy lines. He detested ideological divisions and embraced anyone who sought to follow Christ sincerely, regardless of political affiliation. Son Yang-won was, as his children described, “addicted to Jesus.” His martyrdom was not an accident, but the natural outcome of a life wholly consecrated to Christ. As the “Atomic Bomb of Love,” he exploded the power of the gospel—love, forgiveness, and peace—into a society torn by hatred and war. Even today, his life continues to challenge and inspire those who ask what it truly means to live and die as a follower of Christ.


김양선 목사  金良善Yang Seon Kim

1907 ~ 10/11/1970

In the 1950s, Kim Yang-seon emerged as a practical intellectual who deeply reflected on the historical responsibility and mission of the Korean church amid the political and social turmoil following national liberation. In particular, he sought to critically examine how Christianity had functioned in post-liberation Korea and how the church could contribute to society and the nation. His 1956 publication, The Ten-Year History of Korean Christianity After Liberation (韓國基督敎解放十年史), is regarded as a work that best reveals his historical awareness. This book was the first to comprehensively document the movements and developments of Korean Christianity from 1945 to 1955 in a chronological and thematic structure. More importantly, it represented a pioneering effort to position Christianity within the broader context of national history.

In this work, Kim directly named individuals who had participated in the Japanese-imposed Shinto shrine worship and criticized the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church for its failure to take moral responsibility. He argued that the church must engage in self-reflection and repentance for its historical wrongdoings. This bold critique caused considerable backlash among conservative figures in the denomination, culminating in a 1958 resolution by the General Assembly to ban the publication of his book. However, the controversy sparked by this ban served as a critical turning point in Korean church history, marking one of the earliest calls for ethical reflection and historical responsibility from within the church.

Beyond his critical writings, Kim was also an active educator and revivalist. He taught church history at the Central Theological Seminary for over a decade and worked as a teacher at Soongsil Middle School, where he instilled in students a sense of national and spiritual identity. At the same time, he committed himself to Sunday school education and nationwide revival campaigns. His activities—such as organizing fasting prayers, cooperative evangelism, and lay leadership training—demonstrated his conviction that the gospel must extend beyond individual salvation to serve as a transformative force for society.

His dedication to Christian education was recognized at the institutional level. In 1958, he received a commendation from the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church for his contributions to educational ministry. In the following year, he served as the director of Sunday school education under the General Assembly’s Department of Education and played a major role in organizing the 44th General Assembly. During this period, he worked to systematize Sunday school programs nationwide, develop educational materials, and train teachers, thereby laying the foundation for Christian education in postwar Korea.

Ultimately, the 1950s represent a period in which Kim Yang-seon simultaneously pursued historical insight and practical engagement. Through his writings, he advocated for ethical historiography in the church, while his educational and organizational efforts pointed to a vision of the church grounded in both truth-telling and future-building. For these reasons, he is remembered as a rare figure who combined historical critique with constructive leadership in Korean Christian history.


김기창 金基昶 Ki-chang Kim

02/18/1913 ~ 01/23/2001

Unbo Kim Ki-chang (1914–2001) emerged as a pioneer of indigenized Christian art in Korea during the 1950s. Amid the social turmoil and spiritual devastation following the Korean War, Kim dedicated himself to translating the language of faith into visual form. His art became a channel for expressing the suffering, identity, and hope of the Korean people within the framework of the biblical narrative. The 1950s mark a critical turning point in his artistic journey, especially as seen in his magnum opus, The Life of Jesus, which exemplifies the confluence of Eastern and Western aesthetics, personal spiritual reflection, and a strong sense of national consciousness.

The Life of Jesus, a 30-painting series begun in 1952 and refined through the 1970s, presents the story of Jesus not in its original historical setting, but rather within the context of late Joseon Korea. In these paintings, Jesus appears as a Confucian scholar in traditional attire, and other biblical figures are similarly dressed as Koreans from the 18th or 19th centuries. This bold reimagining is not mere anachronism—it reflects Kim’s theological and artistic attempt to contextualize the Gospel within Korean history and culture. Through this localization, he sought not only to make Christianity more accessible to Koreans but also to offer comfort and hope to a war-torn people.

Kim employed traditional Eastern painting techniques, particularly ink-and-wash and elements of Korean folk painting (minhwa), while also preserving the compositional structure and narrative clarity often found in Western religious art. His portrayal of Jesus avoids overt emotionalism and instead relies on restrained lines, minimal color palettes, and meditative spatial balance, inviting deep contemplation. These stylistic choices echo Kim’s own personal story—having lost his hearing due to a childhood illness, he communicated and experienced the world largely through visual perception. Thus, his artistic vision reflects a search for “the language of silence,” and his work becomes a spiritual exercise in visual theology.

This visual reinterpretation of the Gospel coincided with the Korean people’s urgent need for a restored sense of identity in the aftermath of Japanese colonialism and the Korean War. By portraying Jesus as a figure resembling a Korean nobleman, Kim fused Christian values with Korean ideals of moral leadership and scholarly dignity. While the “yangban Jesus” might suggest social elitism, in Kim’s interpretation, it emphasizes wisdom, virtue, and spiritual authority. In this way, Kim’s art bridges the universality of the Christian message with the specificity of Korean cultural values.

His work earned him the nickname “Korea’s Rembrandt,” not simply due to artistic skill but because, like Rembrandt who painted Jesus with a Jewish face, Kim depicted Jesus with a Korean face. This move is profoundly theological as well as cultural—it asserts that the incarnation can be meaningfully expressed through every people’s history and visage. Rather than relying on European iconography, Kim reclaims the biblical story from a Korean visual standpoint. His restrained and introspective Jesus contrasts sharply with the dramatic, ornate figures common in Western religious painting, thus conveying a spirituality grounded in silence and suffering.

Internationally, The Life of Jesus series drew attention in exhibitions and Christian art circles as a model of indigenous theology through visual art. Critics noted that Kim's reinterpretation of the Gospel was neither derivative nor exoticized, but a sincere and creative translation of Christian faith into Korean idioms. His work illustrates that Christian art need not imitate the West to be considered authentic; it can instead express the Gospel's truth in a culturally faithful manner. Through this project, Kim demonstrated that art could indeed preach the Gospel in a language beyond words.

In essence, Kim Ki-chang’s Christian art of the 1950s represents a remarkable integration of traditional Korean aesthetics, modern theology, and personal piety. The Life of Jesus is not merely a series of religious paintings but a profound expression of what it means to encounter the divine in the midst of historical suffering. Kim’s visual theology showed that Jesus’ life could be told as “our story”—the story of the Korean people. His artistic vision continues to resonate in Korean churches, seminaries, and art circles, offering a lasting model of how faith, culture, and creativity can come together in powerful harmony.381011156970

William Hamilton Shaw 

06/05/1922 ~ 09/22/1950

William Hamilton Shaw (Korean name: Seo Wi-ryeom) was born on June 5, 1922, in Pyongyang to American Methodist missionaries William Earl Shaw and Adeline Hamilton Shaw. His parents were key figures in the early Christian mission efforts in Korea, contributing to the establishment of seminaries and hospitals in Pyongyang. Raised in this missionary context, Shaw became fluent in Korean and deeply familiar with Korean life and culture. He graduated from Pyongyang Foreign School and later attended Ohio Wesleyan University in the United States. He eventually enrolled in the doctoral program in East Asian Studies at Harvard University. At the center of his life was always his Christian faith, which manifested itself in his love for others, his willingness to serve, and ultimately, in his self-sacrifice.

During World War II, Shaw served as an officer in the United States Navy, participating in the European theater and taking part in the Normandy landings. After the war, from 1946 to 1947, he returned to Korea as an instructor at the Korea Maritime Police Academy in Jinhae (now the Republic of Korea Naval Academy), under the U.S. military government. There, he trained cadets not only in navigation and military tactics but also instilled in them a sense of responsibility and service. Many of his students later became foundational leaders of the South Korean Navy. His contribution was not merely technical; it represented a leadership style rooted in Christian ethics, providing a model of how faith-informed education could shape a newly emerging nation.

When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Shaw was pursuing his doctoral studies at Harvard. He voluntarily withdrew from the program and reenlisted in the U.S. Navy. In a letter to his mother, he wrote, “Korea is my home. If the people are fighting for freedom and I am not there with them, I could not live with myself.” This was more than a personal sentiment; it reflected his Christian worldview, his moral conviction, and his understanding of historical responsibility. He identified himself not only as an American or a Korean but ultimately as a citizen of the Kingdom of God, choosing to stand with those who suffered. Thanks to his fluency in Korean and his knowledge of local geography, Shaw was appointed as an intelligence officer under General MacArthur’s command. He participated in the Incheon Landing Operation and soon joined the campaign to recapture Seoul. On September 22, 1950, while operating in the Nokbeon-dong area of Eunpyeong District, he was killed in action during an ambush by North Korean forces. At the time, Shaw was warning civilians to evacuate before an impending artillery strike. He died while attempting to save others, his final act embodying the Christian ideal of laying down one’s life for one’s friends—a form of martyrdom by any theological standard. The U.S. Navy posthumously awarded Shaw the Silver Star, and the South Korean government presented him with the Eulji Order of Military Merit in 1956 and the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit in 2019. Originally buried in Yokosuka, Japan, his remains were relocated to the Yanghwajin Foreign Missionary Cemetery in Seoul in accordance with his mother’s wishes. His gravestone is inscribed with John 15:13: “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” This verse encapsulates his life and faith—a model of a Christian who followed the path of Christ to the end.

Today, Shaw is remembered as a symbol of the Korea–U.S. alliance, with statues erected at the Naval Academy and Peace Park in Eunpyeong, Seoul. However, his legacy should not be confined to military or diplomatic symbolism. Shaw was a missionary’s son who followed the gospel, a disciple of Christ who obeyed God’s calling and gave his life for others. His devotion represents a powerful testimony of how freedom, justice, and faith can be harmonized. His story raises a timeless question for Christians: “For whom, and by what faith, are you living your life today?” William Hamilton Shaw projected the values of the gospel throughout every aspect of his life. He did not regard “freedom” merely as a political concept, nor nation”as an expression of nationalism. His vision was grounded in the love and justice of the Kingdom of God, and for that cause, he willingly gave of himself. His life transcends the Korean War, offering an enduring model of Christian witness across cultures, nations, and generations.


Harold Voelkel

02/14/1898 ~ 1975

One of the most historically significant episodes in the postwar ministry of Harold Voelkel was his pivotal role in the release of anti-communist prisoners of war (POWs) in 1953. As a chaplain at the Geoje Island POW camp during the Korean War, Voelkel dedicated himself to nurturing spiritual freedom and hope through the Gospel among North Korean and Chinese POWs. He supported Christian prisoners who, under grave threat of forced repatriation to the North, wrote blood letters stating “We resolutely oppose repatriation,” which they wore on their foreheads as headbands. Voelkel, moved to tears by their faith and determination, personally delivered one of these blood letters to President Syngman Rhee, leveraging his shared alma mater, Princeton University, to bridge communication. This powerful gesture deeply impressed President Rhee, who was thereby convinced of the strong Christian and pro-democratic presence among the POWs. This event became the catalyst for Rhee’s bold decision to release over 27,000 anti-communist POWs, a move that not only challenged U.S. and UN policies at the time but also precipitated the signing of the Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty just prior to the ceasefire. Voelkel’s role transcended that of a humanitarian or religious figure; his work had tangible geopolitical consequences, shaping postwar diplomacy and national security policy. His commitment to faith-based support within the camps facilitated the creation of Christian communities that mirrored the early church—characterized by shared suffering, encouragement, and fervent prayer. Former POWs testified that they held worship services twice daily, evangelized among fellow prisoners, and experienced spiritual revival under Voelkel’s leadership. In an environment devoid of possessions or comfort, only faith and brotherhood remained.

Following the war, Voelkel continued his support for the released Christian POWs. Many, such as Rev. Kim Chang-sik, received scholarships from Voelkel and pursued theological education. Kim would later graduate from Seoul Theological University, become an ordained minister, plant churches in both Korea and the United States, and serve as a professor in seminary education. Such stories illustrate how Voelkel’s postwar ministry extended beyond relief work to the development of Christian leadership in South Korea. His ministry was neither accidental nor merely reactive. Voelkel was part of a wider evangelical movement that aligned Christian values with anti-communist ideology and South Korea’s national identity. His mission reflected a strategic vision that integrated theology, politics, and humanitarian care. Through rebuilding churches, reestablishing seminaries, and fostering U.S.-Korean church relations, Voelkel helped establish the institutional and ideological foundations of modern Korean Protestantism. Voelkel’s postwar legacy continues to resonate not only in theological institutions and congregations but also in the ideological DNA of Korean Christianity—particularly its resistance to communism, alignment with democracy, and emphasis on education. His life serves as a vivid example of how faith, courage, and conviction can shape the destiny of both individuals and nations.


함석헌 咸錫憲 Seok-heon Ham

03/13/1901 ~ 02/04/1989In the 1950s, Ham Seok-heon played a pivotal role as a public intellectual and religious thinker in redefining the meaning of freedom and reorienting the role of religion in a rapidly transforming Korean society. This was a period marked by the Korean War, ideological polarization between communism and liberal democracy, and the entrenchment of Cold War politics on the Korean peninsula. Within this context, Ham refused to align himself with either the authoritarian South Korean regime or the hegemonic influence of U.S.-style anti-communism. Instead, he proposed a third way rooted in conscience, spirituality, and ethical responsibility.

Ham’s understanding of freedom diverged sharply from the dominant Christian right of the time, which had largely equated freedom with anti-communism and loyalty to Western democracy. For Ham, freedom was not just a political right or opposition to communism—it was an inner moral and spiritual awakening that led individuals to live ethically, to think independently, and to act courageously in the face of oppression. He wrote: “We are not free because we oppose communism or support democracy. We are only free when we recognize our moral duty and stand before God and history with a clean conscience.” His critique extended to the institutional church. He condemned what he saw as the moral collapse of Korean Christianity, which, in his view, had sold out to power and wealth, becoming complicit in the systems of oppression. In his influential 1956 essay, What Is Korean Christianity Doing?, published in Sasang-gye magazine, he asked sharply why the church remained silent amid political corruption, poverty, and suffering. This article not only triggered fierce debates within the Christian community but also signaled Ham’s emergence as a leading prophetic voice.

It was during this time that Ham began developing his concept of the “Ssi-al” (씨알)—literally ""seed grain,"" but symbolically referring to the common people as bearers of spiritual and historical agency. He believed that the Ssi-al represented the conscience of the nation, the hidden vitality of history, and the only true basis for a just society. This idea was revolutionary in a time when national identity was largely framed through elites, political ideologies, or military strength. Ham’s vision of freedom and the Ssi-al intersected in his critique of power. He saw both communism and capitalism as materialist ideologies that reduced the human being to a tool of production or control. In contrast, he advocated for a human-centered society rooted in spiritual dignity, moral struggle, and personal responsibility. He also increasingly distanced himself from doctrinaire Christian exclusivism. Although deeply shaped by Christianity, Ham began to express religious pluralism in the 1950s. He read Hindu texts, engaged with Buddhist ideas, and studied Taoist and Confucian thought. His move toward a post-denominational and transcultural spirituality marked a turning point in his intellectual journey and prepared the ground for his embrace of Quakerism in the following decade.

Furthermore, the 1950s saw Ham acting not only as a theorist but also as a public educator. He delivered lectures and sermons across Korea, seeking to awaken what he called the “sleeping conscience of the people.” He held that democratic revolution was only possible when ordinary people began to think critically and act morally. For Ham, this required education, inner transformation, and ethical leadership—not military coups or foreign intervention. By the end of the 1950s, Ham Seok-heon had effectively laid the foundation for a Korean democratic spirituality—a fusion of prophetic religion, ethical philosophy, and participatory social vision. His ideas directly influenced the democratic uprisings of the 1960s and later shaped the theological foundations of Korea’s minjung (people’s) movement in the 1970s and 1980s.


김재준 金在俊 Jae-joon Kim

09/26/1901 ~ 01/27/1987

The 1950s marked Kim Jae-jun’s transformation from theologian to ecclesiastical reformer and public intellectual. In the aftermath of liberation from Japanese colonial rule and amid the traumatic consequences of the Korean War, the Korean Protestant Church was largely dominated by neo-orthodox conservatism. Kim opposed what he viewed as an ""anti-historical and anti-cultural orthodoxy,"" calling instead for a theology that was historically responsible, nationally conscious, and morally engaged with society.

After the liberation in 1945, Kim resumed his leadership of Chosun Theological Seminary, which he had co-founded in 1940. Unlike the newly established Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Namsan, led by Park Hyung-ryong, Chosun Seminary embraced liberal theology and welcomed the historical-critical approach to biblical interpretation. Kim's insistence on biblical fallibility (biblical errancy) and theological openness led to increasing tension with conservative factions within the Presbyterian General Assembly. The controversy culminated in 1947 during the 33rd General Assembly with the so-called ""Statement of 51"" incident, in which 51 delegates submitted a petition denouncing Kim’s theology. Despite the theological nature of the dispute, the conflict became mired in regionalism and power struggles between northern and southern church leaders. The situation escalated when the General Assembly approved a new seminary (the Presbyterian Seminary) under Park Hyung-ryong in 1949, resulting in two rival seminaries under the same denomination.

During the Korean War, the conflict intensified. In May 1952, the 37th General Assembly revoked the status of both seminaries as official theological institutions and instead decided to establish a new seminary in Daegu. However, the resolution collapsed amid protests from Chosun Seminary supporters. The Assembly refrained from formally disciplining Kim, instead delegating the decision to his regional presbytery. The presbytery, however, refused to comply and issued a public statement rejecting the General Assembly's ruling as unconstitutional. This rebellion against ecclesiastical authority received tacit support from foreign missions, including the Canadian Presbyterian Mission and the American Southern Presbyterian Mission. In 1952, amid growing polarization, Kim resumed publication of The Crusader (Sipjagun), a theological and socio-political magazine. It became a platform for articulating not only religious liberty and theological openness but also critiques of authoritarianism, social inequality, and reactionary nationalism. The Crusader positioned itself at the intersection of faith, conscience, and historical responsibility. 

In 1953, at the 38th General Assembly in Daegu, Kim Jae-jun was officially defrocked on the grounds that he continued to promote “biblical errancy.” In response, Kim and his supporters formally separated and founded the Korean Christian Church (Kijang) in 1954 at the newly established Korea Theological College in Dongja-dong, Seoul. This was not merely a denominational split but a symbolic declaration of the right to religious conscience and theological freedom in the face of conservative church orthodoxy. Kim’s rejection of both reactionary nationalism and Cold War anti-communism set him apart from both the mainstream church and the state. Instead, he emphasized a vision of freedom rooted not in Western liberal ideology per se, but in a theological anthropology that centered on the dignity of the individual conscience before God. The founding of Kijang therefore institutionalized a church that sought to be prophetic rather than popular, free rather than doctrinally controlled, and socially responsible rather than spiritually escapist.

These struggles in the 1950s would lay the foundation for Kim’s subsequent development of a participatory theology and his leading role in Korea’s religious-based democratization movement in the decades that followed.


Paul Roh Ki-nam 盧基南 노기남

01/22/1902 ~ 06/25/1984

During the 1950s, Archbishop Nogi Nam stood as a central figure not only in the Korean Catholic Church but also in the broader context of modern Korean history. With the Korean War erupting in 1950, he actively interpreted the conflict not simply as a civil war, but as an ideological struggle between communism and liberal democracy. This interpretation shaped his call for the faithful to resist communism with the spirit of martyrdom, framing the war as a battle for religious freedom and national identity.

Archbishop Nam took a hands-on approach in politics, forming close ties with the U.S. military government and the South Korean government. He helped select political candidates, recommended right-wing leaders to the U.S. military, and played a critical role in the post-liberation ideological alignment of South Korea. He also utilized the Catholic press—particularly the revival of Kyunghyang Magazine and Kyunghyang Newspaper—as tools to promote anti-communist ideology and support the establishment of a democratic government.

Following the Korean War, the Catholic population in Korea surged from approximately 170,000 in 1953 to over 530,000 by 1962. This was not only due to war-related displacement and the search for spiritual comfort but also to the Church’s increasingly visible role in national affairs. Archbishop Nam led efforts to expand the Church's structure by elevating vicariates to dioceses and founding educational institutions, most notably Sogang University. Despite his contributions, he faced political backlash, particularly from President Rhee Syngman's regime. Tensions with Rhee escalated due to Nam's support for Jang Myeon and his government's opposition. This culminated in the forced closure of Kyunghyang Newspaper in 1959. Nevertheless, Nam’s influence endured through the early 1960s, especially during the Second Republic and even after the 1961 military coup led by Park Chung-hee.

In essence, Archbishop Nogi Nam’s leadership in the 1950s laid the foundation for the Catholic Church’s growth and public presence in Korea. His pragmatic approach to social participation shaped the Church as not only a spiritual community but also a moral and ideological force in Korea’s nation-building era.

Swanson, Ererett E. 

11/15/1913 ~ 11/04/1965


Everett Swanson’s life and ministry in postwar Korea exemplify the evangelical Christian response to social crisis through humanitarian compassion. Born in 1913 in Sycamore, Illinois, to Swedish immigrant parents, Swanson experienced a religious conversion at the Queen Anne Baptist Church in Seattle in 1923. He later became a traveling revivalist and served as a Baptist pastor for over a decade in Washington and Chicago. In July 1950, he resigned from his church to pursue a global evangelistic calling, which led him to war-torn Korea during the Korean War.

His encounter with the tragedy of war orphans in Korea became a turning point in his ministry. After visiting Daegu in 1952 and witnessing orphaned children suffering from hunger and neglect, Swanson felt compelled to act. A local missionary challenged him, saying, “Swanson, you’ve seen the need and the opportunities here—what will you do about it?” That question haunted him throughout his return flight to the U.S., leading him to vow his support for Korean children. 

Rather than building a conventional missionary organization, Swanson envisioned a method of direct support. In 1952, he sent $1,000 through a local missionary to purchase a house in Bukpyeong, Gangwon Province—this became the first orphanage he supported, named Shin Ae Won (House of New Love). Over the next few years, he established or funded numerous other orphanages, often converting missionaries’ homes or church properties into shelters. By 1961, the number of orphanages he supported had grown to 113, aiding over 4,500 children. 

A transformative moment in Swanson’s work came in 1954, when he introduced the innovative ""one-to-one sponsorship"" model. This allowed an American family to directly sponsor a Korean child, providing $4 monthly for food, clothing, education, and spiritual care. Swanson wrote in his diary that he realized supporting an orphanage was not enough—""we must invest in the whole person""—and thus began to focus on holistic child development. 

In 1956, Swanson formalized his work by establishing the Everett Swanson Evangelistic Association (ESEA), headquartered in Chicago. The organization, later renamed Compassion in 1963, reflected its new mission of “releasing children from poverty in Jesus’ name.” Inspired by Matthew 15:32, the name Compassion emphasized empathy and active care rather than institutional charity alone. 

Compassion’s work extended far beyond orphanage construction. The organization offered:

Medical aid, including shipment of $1 million in supplies annually and direct medical support from staff nurses. 

Vocational education, with schools for boys (farming in Gimpo) and girls (sewing, crafts, and English typing at the Youngjin Center). 

Higher education scholarships and study abroad programs, especially through partnerships with American evangelical foundations. 

Support for local pastors, particularly those in remote areas or special ministries, reflecting the belief that strengthening the Korean church was essential for community rebuilding. 

The WARM (Winter Aid Relief Money) project, which provided long coats and winter clothing to help children participate in normal seasonal activities, such as skating and snow play. 

Adoption assistance, which included screening adoptive parents for spiritual maturity. Compassion emphasized that adoptive parents be “born-again Christians.” 

Swanson died in November 1965 after a short battle with a brain tumor. His wife Miriam and missionary Henry Harvey continued the leadership of Compassion, which by then had become one of the “big four” Christian relief agencies in Korea alongside World Vision, CCF, and OMS.

Church World Service (CWS) 세계기독교봉사회


In the 1950s, the Church World Service (CWS) emerged as one of the most active Christian humanitarian organizations operating in postwar Korea. Originating in 1946 in the aftermath of World War II, CWS was founded by a coalition of American Protestant denominations aiming to provide emergency relief to war-stricken populations in Europe and Asia. By 1951, CWS was formally incorporated as a department of the National Council of Churches (NCC) in the United States, representing over 30 member denominations, and gradually expanded its international operations to include Korea. Following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, CWS moved swiftly to organize its relief efforts. In July 1951, the Korea Church World Service (KCWS) was officially established as the Korean branch, with Edward Adams appointed as chair and Henry D. Appenzeller serving as general secretary. Registered with the United Nations Civil Assistance Command Korea (UNCACK), KCWS was able to legally import and distribute relief goods in cooperation with domestic missionary and social service organizations. Early relief efforts included the distribution of food, medicine, clothing, and essential supplies to war orphans, widows, refugees, and amputees—many of whom were victims of the war's devastation. CWS activities in Korea gradually transitioned from short-term aid to long-term development initiatives. While initially focused on emergency relief, CWS began integrating community development strategies into its programs by the mid-1950s. This shift aligned with broader international trends and U.S. foreign aid policy, particularly the emphasis on ""self-help"" and sustainable reconstruction. CWS supported medical rehabilitation projects, vocational training, orphanages, and technical schools. In addition, it collaborated with Korean Christian organizations such as the Union Christian Service Center (UCSC), YWCA, and YMCA, offering financial and material support while respecting local autonomy and leadership.

One of the most significant contributions of CWS during this period was its involvement in urban resettlement projects. In particular, the Eungam-dong Resettlement Project in 1958 exemplified how CWS expanded its activities to address the challenges of urban poverty and natural disaster relief. Following a devastating flood that displaced over 9,000 residents from the makeshift shantytown in Ichon-dong along the Han River, CWS collaborated with the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other international agencies such as the Catholic Relief Service (CRS) to relocate and rehouse flood victims. CWS played a central role in constructing temporary shelters, operating food kitchens, and providing building materials for permanent housing. Importantly, the project applied a self-help model, wherein residents were expected to participate in interior construction while the government and aid organizations handled infrastructure and structural work. Despite logistical delays and limitations in resources, this project was a milestone in Korea’s postwar urban welfare history, representing an early attempt to establish Christian community-based social development within a rapidly urbanizing context.

This endeavor also marked a significant expansion of CWS’s mission—from rural development to urban humanitarian intervention. It demonstrated a clear response to the growing needs of postwar Korean society, particularly as the population of Seoul surged and informal settlements proliferated. In this respect, CWS’s engagement in urban resettlement was not only practical but symbolically powerful, embodying the ecumenical spirit in action and pioneering a model of Christian social welfare that combined relief with reconstruction and advocacy. The philosophical underpinning of CWS’s work was deeply rooted in the Social Gospel tradition. While its activities aligned in part with the anti-communist orientation of U.S. Cold War policy, the mission of CWS went beyond geopolitical motives. It was driven by a theological commitment to social justice and compassion—viewing the alleviation of poverty, disease, and displacement as moral imperatives of the Christian faith. Through its partnership with Korean churches and communities, CWS fostered a sustainable framework that would later influence the rise of Korean Christian NGOs and faith-based development work in the decades to come. By the late 1960s, many of the programs initiated by CWS were gradually handed over to Korean organizations, such as the Korea Christian Service (KCS), reflecting a transition toward local ownership and self-sufficiency. This trajectory affirms the dual legacy of CWS in Korea: as both a provider of urgent humanitarian aid during a time of national crisis and as a catalyst for the indigenization of Christian social action and development.


Union Christian Service Center (UCSC) 기독교연합봉사회


The Union Christian Service Center (UCSC), established in Daejeon in 1949, was Korea’s first missionary-led ecumenical service organization founded in response to the postwar crisis and the devastation of the Korean War. Unlike other foreign aid agencies of the time, UCSC was not directed by a headquarters overseas; it was an autonomous initiative launched by missionaries from various denominations—including the Northern Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Salvation Army, and the United Church of Canada—who sought to embody Christian values through practical social engagement and reconstruction in Korea.

From the beginning, UCSC went beyond mere relief work. Its mission was rooted in Christian ideals of justice, compassion, and empowerment. Central to its activities was the establishment of Christian rural leadership training schools—commonly known as Gospel Farmers' Schools —throughout the country. Starting in 1953 in Daejeon, the schools expanded to Hae-nam, Gwangju, Chuncheon, and Cheongju, providing six-month to year-long courses in modern agricultural techniques, cooperative management, leadership skills, and Christian ethics. Graduates of these programs returned to their villages as leaders capable of organizing and revitalizing their local communities. UCSC also operated model farms where modern agricultural methods—such as mechanized farming, improved fertilizers, and crop hybridization—were tested and taught. These farms served as living laboratories and community centers, enabling farmers to learn by doing. In addition, UCSC established clinics, rehabilitation centers, and vocational training workshops for war orphans, widows, amputees, and other marginalized groups. The prosthetics workshops and physical therapy programs pioneered by UCSC were especially innovative and largely unavailable elsewhere in Korea at the time. The organization placed special emphasis on empowering women and youth. Sewing classes, vocational programs, and literacy education for women were introduced in various regions. These efforts enabled women to gain financial independence and return to their communities as educators or volunteer leaders. While most foreign aid organizations of the time focused on children and male breadwinners, UCSC recognized women and youth as critical actors in rebuilding postwar society.

UCSC’s success was also due to its strong collaborative networks. It maintained partnerships with the Korea Church World Service (KCWS), Christian Children’s Fund (CCF), YWCA, YMCA, and the Korea National Christian Council (KNCC), among others. These partnerships allowed for efficient distribution of resources and shared responsibility in community-based programs. For example, the Gospel Farmers' Schools were funded by KCWS, while women's education programs were co-managed with YWCA. Crucially, UCSC’s philosophy was not one of charity but of participation, education, and self-help. Rather than simply providing aid, UCSC empowered individuals and communities to identify their needs, build capacities, and take ownership of their recovery. This approach anticipated many of the participatory development and community organizing principles that would later define Korean NGOs and Christian civic movements. By the late 1950s, UCSC had established dozens of local centers across the country, each serving not only as a service facility but also as a hub for Christian community-building and grassroots empowerment. Its three-pronged strategy—leadership training, material support, and community organization—became a model for future Christian development work in Korea.

In sum, UCSC was one of the most innovative and holistic Christian mission-based social movements in postwar Korea. By integrating war relief, rural development, vocational training, rehabilitation services, and community organizing into a coherent ministry, UCSC not only addressed urgent needs but also laid the foundations for a long-term vision of Christian engagement with Korean society. Its legacy continues today as a foundational model for Christian social welfare and civic action.


Christian Children’s Fund (CCF) 기독교아동복리회


The Christian Children’s Fund (CCF), originally founded in 1938 by American Presbyterian minister J. Calvitt Clarke, was one of the most active and influential foreign non-governmental organizations in Korea during and after the Korean War. Established with a vision to support children suffering from war and poverty across the globe, CCF began informal activities in Korea around 1948. Its efforts intensified dramatically after the outbreak of the Korean War, leading to its official registration as a foundation in 1955 under the name ""Christian Children’s Fund of Korea.""

During the 1950s, CCF focused primarily on direct aid to children and collaboration with local welfare institutions. Its signature initiative was a one-to-one sponsorship program that connected American sponsors with individual Korean children. This system, novel at the time in Korea, enabled consistent and personalized support in the form of food, clothing, medicine, educational materials, and emotional care. Letters, photographs, and gifts exchanged between sponsors and children fostered not only material assistance but also emotional bonds and a sense of connection to the outside world—a crucial factor in healing the psychological wounds left by war.

CCF’s support extended far beyond orphanages. By partnering with over 250 childcare institutions nationwide, the organization offered comprehensive assistance including tuition, medical support, vocational training, hygiene education, and psychosocial counseling. It also established the CCF Korea Federation in 1953, a network that brought together directors of child welfare institutions across the country. This federation played a pivotal role in shaping Korea’s early social welfare infrastructure and helped to professionalize child welfare practices. CCF also published Donggwang, a professional journal for social workers, fostering the development of indigenous welfare theories and practices. In particular, CCF was deeply involved in the Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, where the devastation of war had left a significant number of orphans and impoverished children. Institutions such as the Gwangju Christian Nursery, Suncheon Gospel Nursery, and Yeosu Christian Nursery became key sites of CCF's involvement. These facilities, often established or run by local churches and missionaries, received financial and material support through CCF’s sponsorship model. The Gwangju Christian Nursery, for example, developed a long-term partnership with a church community in Louisiana, USA. Through this relationship, children not only received regular aid but also engaged in personal exchanges with their sponsors, forming enduring transnational relationships that strengthened their sense of identity and hope. CCF’s commitment to partnership with local institutions was evident in its efforts to strengthen the capabilities of childcare workers. It regularly held training seminars and leadership workshops for local welfare administrators in the Honam region, which helped fill the vacuum in formal social work education at the time. CCF also developed mobile distribution systems to deliver food, clothing, and educational supplies to children living outside of institutions, particularly in isolated rural areas. This flexible and inclusive approach extended the reach of child welfare services to those who were often excluded from traditional welfare systems.

By the late 1950s, CCF had become a de facto pillar of Korea’s child welfare system. At a time when government funding for child welfare was minimal—accounting for only 26.8% of facility budgets in 1957—foreign aid made up 32.8%, with CCF as one of the largest contributors. As the 1960s progressed, foreign aid surpassed 50% of funding in the sector. In this context, CCF functioned not merely as a relief organization but as a substitute welfare provider in the absence of state capacity. Its efforts laid the groundwork for Korea’s eventual transition toward a more institutionalized and professionalized welfare system. The legacy of CCF in 1950s Korea is threefold. First, it established a systematic, sustainable approach to child welfare through its sponsorship and institutional support model. Second, it contributed to the formation and professionalization of Korea’s social welfare workforce through education, networking, and publication. Third, it provided a transitional framework for Korea’s welfare system at a time when the state was unable to fulfill this role. CCF’s welfare philosophy emphasized holistic care and dignity, not charity. Through personalized support, institutional partnerships, and grassroots empowerment, it shaped a new paradigm of child welfare in Korea. The Gwangju and Jeolla region examples are representative of how CCF’s impact extended beyond urban centers and into rural communities across the nation. These regional efforts underscore the organization’s commitment to building localized, sustainable models of care that reflected the complex needs of postwar Korean society. Ultimately, the Christian Children’s Fund played a leading role in developing Korea’s child welfare system during one of the most vulnerable periods in its modern history. Its work went beyond relief—it built structures, nurtured communities, and empowered children and caregivers alike. Its legacy lives on today through its successor organization, ChildFund Korea (formerly Korea Christian Children's Fund), one of the largest child welfare NGOs in the country.


YWCA


In the 1950s, the YWCA of Korea played a pivotal role in Christian women's activism through a range of practical efforts aimed at supporting women, children, and local communities during the national crises of liberation and the Korean War. Organizationally, it resumed activities that had been halted under Japanese colonial rule, and in 1947 sent a delegation of ten women to the World YWCA Council in Hangzhou, China. This marked a major step in re-establishing Korea YWCA as an independent actor within the international women’s movement. When the Korean War broke out, the YWCA immediately mobilized to provide relief for refugees, war orphans, and widows. Branches in Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, and other cities opened their centers as shelters, hosting hundreds of refugees daily and distributing food and clothing. They also founded orphanages, offered child care, and supported the livelihoods of single mothers and war widows. For example, Daejeon YWCA provided shelter to more than 150 people per day, while Gwangju YWCA, led by General Secretary Jo Ah-ra, established a nursery to offer practical support to women and children in the region.

Simultaneously, the YWCA provided vocational training and education to support women's self-reliance. Women were taught practical skills such as sewing, cooking, and household management to help them achieve economic independence. Leadership training for women was also emphasized, enabling them to become active participants in social life. Youth and student programs continued through Bible study and cultural activities, and student groups were organized to train young leaders. Even amidst war, these initiatives helped foster a sense of community and moral values among the next generation.

Esther Park, who served as a senior advisor, acted as a civilian diplomat while staying in the United States during the war. She reached out to the World YWCA and the United Nations to inform them about Korea’s desperate situation and request assistance. In an article for the World YWCA bulletin, she wrote that ""we cannot just sit and cry,"" emphasizing hope and a sense of responsibility despite the devastation. Her international outreach contributed greatly to securing humanitarian support from abroad. In addition to relief work, the YWCA also conducted educational programs for women in rural areas, promoted local welfare initiatives, and operated programs to instill democratic civic values. Through all of these activities, the YWCA established itself not merely as a Christian women's organization but as a community committed to social responsibility. Rooted in Christian faith, its efforts helped restore families, support women, and rebuild communities in a war-torn society, laying the foundation for the broader social movements of the 1960s and 1970s."

Church Reconstruction Movement 교회재건운동

In the aftermath of the Korean War, the church reconstruction movement in 1950s Korea emerged as a comprehensive and multifaceted response to the spiritual, social, and material devastation caused by the conflict. Churches were not only physically destroyed—541 Presbyterian churches, 239 Methodist churches, 106 Holiness churches, and 4 Salvation Army churches were either damaged or completely lost —but thousands of pastors and believers were killed, and the Christian faith itself was tested by ideological betrayal and persecution.

International Christian organizations, particularly from the United States, extended large-scale humanitarian aid, including food, clothing, and medical supplies. The Church World Service alone distributed over 23 million pounds of food and nearly a million pounds of clothing by 1959. This support laid the groundwork for rebuilding churches, providing care for war widows, orphans, and the disabled, and reviving the Christian mission in Korea.

Within the church, the war exposed theological and ethical fault lines. While some Christian leaders compromised with North Korean authorities, others paid with their lives for remaining faithful. This reality led to a period of profound repentance and spiritual renewal. Notable evangelistic gatherings, such as Billy Graham’s rallies in Busan (1952) and Seoul (1956), became pivotal moments for the restoration of the Christian spirit and public witness.

At the same time, Korean churches pursued aggressive evangelistic efforts. The Presbyterian Church designated 1952 as “the year of evangelism” and implemented a four-stage strategy—personal renewal, personal evangelism, cooperative outreach, and church-based campaigns. This resulted in the establishment of over 2,050 new churches by 1955 across denominations including Presbyterian, Methodist, and Holiness churches.

The church also responded to the widespread social crisis. Welfare initiatives included the Holt Adoption Program, which sent over 2,000 orphans to adoptive families in the U.S. by 1959, and prosthetics and rehabilitation services for war veterans and civilians. Christian organizations built orphanages, homes for widows, rehabilitation centers, and hospitals. Figures like Torrey and John Steensma were instrumental in providing prosthetics and employment for the disabled.

Christian schools played a key role in the national recovery. Institutions such as Soongsil, Ewha, and Yonsei reopened or relocated to South Korea, resuming higher education under Christian leadership. Informal education programs—including literacy classes, Bible clubs, and correspondence Bible courses—contributed both to Christian formation and national literacy campaigns.

One of the most groundbreaking developments was the introduction of the military chaplaincy system, initiated in 1951 by President Syngman Rhee. By 1955, over 330 military chaplains were serving across the Korean armed forces. Christian outreach even extended to prisoners of war: approximately 60,000 POWs converted to Christianity, and many refused repatriation to North Korea.

Thus, the church reconstruction movement in 1950s Korea was far more than a rebuilding of church buildings—it was a holistic endeavor to restore faith, heal a war-torn society, and spread the gospel. This period laid the spiritual and institutional foundations for the explosive growth of Korean Christianity in the decades that followed.

Christian Family Life Movement 기독교여성가정생활운동


The Christian Family Life Movement in 1950s Korea emerged from the Christian community’s conscious effort to rebuild families amid the upheavals of liberation and the Korean War. In a society devastated by war, the family was seen as the starting point for rebuilding and as the foundation for restoring the national community. Christianity aimed to restore society’s moral and ethical order through the recovery of Christian families. In this context, Korean Christians participated in the East Asia Christian Family Life Conference held in Manila, Philippines, in November 1954. Inspired by the conference, they returned to Korea and launched the Christian Family Life Movement in earnest. In February 1955, the Christian Family Life Committee was officially established under the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK). Drawing from the Christian Family Life Movement already active in the United States, Europe, and Asia, the committee began to implement programs to instill Christian values in Korean homes. The movement emphasized the “integration of faith and life,” advocating that the Christianization of the family was essential for the moral and spiritual recovery of postwar Korean society. Educational programs were conducted nationwide, targeting churches, schools, and universities. These included lectures on Christian ethics, premarital guidance, child-rearing, and marriage counseling. At the heart of the movement was the Christian monthly magazine New Home (Saegajeong), which served not merely as a religious publication but as a practical guide for everyday family life. The magazine systematized and disseminated the theory of Christian family life, addressing topics such as marital relationships, parenting, sexual ethics, and household responsibilities from a Christian perspective. It promoted the ideal of a rational and scientifically minded housewife—an educated, responsible, and faith-driven woman who managed the household efficiently and faithfully.

While emphasizing women’s role in the home, the movement also idealized motherhood and the moral authority of women within the family. Women were viewed as central to the transmission and embodiment of Christian ethics, both as mothers and as wives. Although this promoted a somewhat progressive image of women as active agents, it also reinforced traditional gender roles by situating their influence primarily within the domestic sphere. New Home also emphasized Christian views on love, chastity, and marriage, particularly targeting young adults with messages about premarital purity, lifelong marital fidelity, and the sacredness of the family covenant. Beyond the private sphere, the movement regarded the Christian family as a building block of the nation. Establishing sound Christian homes was seen as foundational to national reconstruction. The family was viewed as a training ground for democracy, freedom, responsibility, and moral order. With this vision, the movement became a cross-denominational effort, uniting various Christian groups around the shared goal of shaping a moral and faithful society through the household.

The Christian Family Life Movement of the 1950s, then, was not only a spiritual or religious initiative but also a cultural and social campaign that responded to the moral disarray of postwar Korea. By promoting Christian values in everyday life, it aimed to heal the broken social fabric and guide the people toward a better future. While the movement retained some limitations, especially in its reinforcement of conventional gender norms, it nevertheless played a formative role in shaping postwar Korean society and laid important groundwork for later developments in women’s welfare, family planning, and Christian social ethics.

The South Korean Military Chaplaincy


 The South Korean military chaplaincy of the 1950s was more than a matter of religious service within the armed forces. It functioned as a political and ideological apparatus tightly interwoven with the anti-communist agenda of President Syngman Rhee’s regime. The institutionalization of Christian chaplaincy during the Korean War was central to state efforts to forge legitimacy, mobilize ideology, and establish close ties between religion and national identity. Based on the two provided academic articles, this analysis offers a detailed account of how military chaplaincy emerged and operated during this pivotal decade.

Following Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, South Korean society experienced a severe deficit of political legitimacy. Former collaborators with Japanese imperial rule continued to hold positions of power, and economic inequality deepened amidst political repression. President Syngman Rhee’s government, though outwardly promoting “freedom and democracy,” functioned in an authoritarian manner. To address its ideological void and consolidate authority, the regime strategically embraced Christianity, particularly Protestantism, as a foundational moral and ideological force.

By the late 1940s and early 1950s, Christianity had already become embedded in the upper echelons of South Korean politics. Many Protestant leaders were northern refugees who had fled religious persecution under the North Korean communist regime. They brought with them a fervent anti-communism and a readiness to align with the southern government. These church leaders, together with American missionaries, became instrumental in shaping South Korea’s emerging ideological and moral culture. Christianity was not only a spiritual force but also a symbolic bond between South Korea and the United States—its most important Cold War ally. In September 1950, just months after the Korean War broke out, the Committee for the Advancement of the Establishment of Chaplaincy in the Korean Army was formed. It included key American missionaries such as George Carroll and prominent Korean Protestant leaders like Han Kyung-jik and Yoo Hyung-ki. On February 7, 1951, a Military Religion Bureau was officially created within the personnel department of the South Korean Army. Drawing from American models, chaplains were initially civilians funded by their own denominations. They were later granted salaried and commissioned officer status by 1954. Chaplains did far more than offer religious comfort. They preached anti-communism, offered moral training, and worked to convert soldiers to Christianity—often equating Christian belief with loyalty to the South Korean state. In prisons and POW camps like the one on Geoje Island, missionaries such as Harold Voelkel and his Korean associates converted tens of thousands of North Korean prisoners. It is estimated that by 1952, more than 15,000 prisoners had become Christians, and a large number chose not to be repatriated to the North. These religious activities were also psychological and political tools used to transform potential adversaries into allies. By 1954, approximately 20% of South Korean soldiers were Christians—mostly Protestants—a stark contrast to the general population, where Christians made up only about 2%. Protestant churches rapidly constructed field churches within military units, and new converts remained loyal to their denominations after discharge, boosting church membership and influence in civilian society.

Meanwhile, Korean Buddhism was largely excluded from the military chaplaincy during this period. Institutional Buddhism had suffered from its perceived collaboration with Japanese imperialism, a lack of international support, and internal divisions. Although some monks independently carried out religious activities—distributing amulets, holding funerals, and preaching Buddhist teachings—the government rejected formal petitions to include Buddhist chaplains. Despite these challenges, some Buddhist leaders, particularly in the southern regions around Busan, attempted to build informal military Buddhist communities with the support of sympathetic officers. These monks appealed to Korean nationalism by referencing traditional Silla-era military ideals, particularly the Hwarang spirit and the Five Commandments of the Buddhist master Won’gwang, which emphasized loyalty, courage, and battlefield virtue. Still, these efforts had limited institutional support and failed to counter the state’s clear preference for Christianity. In the end, Buddhist participation in military religious life was informal, fragmented, and subordinate to a Christian-dominated system. 

Thus, military chaplaincy in 1950s South Korea was not merely a spiritual service but a tool of state-building and ideological mobilization. It served to legitimize the regime, strengthen military discipline, and promote Christianity as a national ideology. This fusion of state power and Protestant influence helped Christianity to grow rapidly and gain cultural dominance in postwar South Korea. Meanwhile, Buddhism, though still the religion of many rural and lay Koreans, remained institutionally marginalized until the 1960s and 1970s, when it began to make more formal inroads into military and state structures.


Non-Church Movement


The Non-Church Movement emerged in 1950s Korea as a distinctive religious praxis that challenged both ecclesiastical institutions and state ideology, offering instead an ethic grounded in Scripture and communal life. Rather than merely rejecting institutional churches, the leaders of this movement sought to embody the essence of the gospel in social and ethical terms, especially in the midst of postwar national trauma. Kim Kyo-shin and Ham Seok-heon, along with their successors such as Ryu Daryeong and Lee Chan-gap, broadened the theoretical and practical horizons of Korean Christianity beyond institutional boundaries.

Kim Kyo-shin, the ideological foundation-layer of the movement, famously declared that “there is salvation outside the Church,” emphasizing a personal, scripture-centered faith rooted in ethical living. He stated, “Talk of the afterlife does not comfort me—it only breeds frustration or outrage,” adding, “What I seek is not sanctification after death, nor promises of heaven, but to reach completeness even for a single day in this body and life”. This reflects his conviction that true faith must manifest in the present world, not in eschatological speculation.

This spirit was inherited by Ham Seok-heon, who expanded Non-Church thought into historical philosophy and Minjung theology from the mid-1950s onward. In 1958, he was arrested for his political commentary in Sasang-gye, a pivotal moment that marked his resistance to both church and state authority. For Ham, the Minjung (common people) were not merely the oppressed masses, but the historical subjects through whom God’s will would unfold: “Within the word ‘Minjung’ lies a desperate hope for the historical agency of the lowest and most powerless people”. This idea would later evolve into his famed Ssi-al (Seed) philosophy.

Ham’s thought transcended denominational boundaries, drawing upon Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism in an effort to overcome the exclusivism of modern religion. His Ssi-al concept captured this vision: “Ssi-al are the lowest, most neglected people of this land... but they are the real agents who will transform it”. Between the late 1950s and early 1960s, he developed this theory into a complete framework of civic subjectivity, later known as citizen discourse.

This philosophical current was carried into practice by Ryu Daryeong, whose 1954 book For a New History presented the Danish folk high school and cooperative movements as a Christian model for Korea’s rural transformation. The book became immensely influential, undergoing dozens of printings, and laid the groundwork for his appointment in 1961 as the first director of the National Reconstruction Movement. Ryu later wrote that he “hung a large photo of Grundtvig on [his] wall and looked at it in prayer each morning before leaving for work”.

Meanwhile, Lee Chan-gap, a direct disciple of Kim Kyo-shin, founded the Pulmu School in 1958, bringing Non-Church ideals into the realm of alternative education. Inspired by the Osan School legacy and the Danish folk high school model, he centered the curriculum on “the language and history of the people.” The Pulmu School is considered a living realization of the Non-Church emphasis on self-reliance, ethical community, and faith-based education.

Ultimately, the Non-Church Movement of the 1950s was not simply a rejection of institutional Christianity—it was an embodied experiment in prophetic witness, communal education, and alternative nationhood. Ham Seok-heon’s Ssi-al theology represents its ideological flowering, while Ryu and Lee’s work demonstrate the movement’s practical reach. These figures stood at the margins of both state and church, striving instead to forge a faithful path rooted in Scripture, peoplehood, and historical agency. In doing so, the Non-Church Movement became a significant waypoint in modern Korean Christianity’s journey toward liberation, education, and radical ethical engagement.

Division of the Korean Presbyterian Church


The 1950s witnessed a series of schisms within the Korean Presbyterian Church, marking one of the most transformative and divisive decades in its history. These divisions were not merely administrative, but rather the result of deep theological disagreements, divergent political ideologies, and contrasting interpretations of church polity. Central to this period were three major breakaways: the Kosin denomination in 1952, the Korean Christian Church (Kijang) in 1953, and the split between Tonghap and Hapdong in 1959. Each schism revealed underlying tensions related to doctrine, church governance, and the global ecumenical movement, and each group developed distinct constitutional responses to these challenges.


Historical and Theological Background

Theological divergence began brewing in the 1930s and 40s, especially concerning modernist and fundamentalist approaches to scripture, the role of the church in society, and the interpretation of confessions. The immediate post-war years intensified these debates. The Kosin group separated over issues of Shinto shrine worship and doctrinal purity. The formation of the Kijang denomination stemmed from conflicts surrounding Rev. Kim Jae-joon and Chosun Seminary, particularly the desire to preserve freedom of theological inquiry. Finally, the Tonghap–Hapdong split in 1959 centered around ecumenical engagement, the WCC, and internal church politics involving delegate selection and financial scandals.


The formation of Kijang and Its Constitutional Vision

The Korean Christian Church (Kijang) was officially formed in 1953, soon after the 1952 General Assembly removed Rev. Kim Jae-joon from ministry. The Kijang church prioritized freedom of conscience, historical-critical theology, and a socially engaged gospel. Its constitutional development reflected these values. In 1956, the denomination revised the polity section of its constitution, abolishing traditional learner classes, introducing the office of assistant pastors, and authorizing the ordination of women. In 1972, the church adopted a new Confession of Faith that emphasized contextual and reconciliation-oriented theology, moving beyond the Westminster Confession.


The Tonghap-Hapdong Division and Conflicting Politics

The 1959 General Assembly in Daejeon became the setting for the final rupture between conservatives aligned with the NAE (National Association of Evangelicals) and moderates who accepted participation in the WCC under conditions. The controversy over the Gyeonggi Presbytery’s delegate list and the General Assembly’s vote to accept delegates from an 'irregular' session resulted in the NAE faction walking out and forming a separate body. Tonghap emphasized church unity, mission, and ecumenical openness, while Hapdong focused on doctrinal exclusivity and anti-ecumenism. Their divergent approaches became codified in their respective constitutions and theological education systems.


Table 1. Key Issues in Schism and Comparative Positions

| Issue | Tonghap (Unified) Perspective | Hapdong (Separated) Perspective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Immediate Cause | Political conflict post Park Hyung-ryong’s financial scandal | WCC participation and ecumenical deviation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stance on WCC | Initially neutral, later conditionally accepted withdrawal | Strongly opposed, framed as liberal and pro-communist |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role of NAE | Criticized as a church power bloc | Seen as representing true evangelical identity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gyeonggi Presbytery Incident | Emphasis on procedural legitimacy and reorganization | Claimed voting fraud and maintained legitimacy of regular presbytery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Assembly Procedure | Asserted democratic decision-making through official vote | Denounced result as illegitimate due to missionary influence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role of Missionaries | Criticized for taking sides and supporting ecumenical camp | Viewed as political interference and a threat to church autonomy |

*The 1922 Constitution and Presbyterian Polity Principles

The 1922 Constitution was a foundational document for all major Presbyterian groups in Korea. Based on American Presbyterianism, it incorporated key principles of governance that initially unified the church. These included:

Representative government: authority resides in elected elders and ministers.

Collegial leadership: governance is shared through a hierarchy of church courts.

Constitutionalism: church governance must conform to established written laws.

Connectionalism: congregations are part of a wider web of mutual accountability.

Over time, the interpretation of these principles diverged. Kijang adapted them flexibly for contextual mission, Tonghap maintained a centralized polity emphasizing unity and outreach, and Hapdong focused on strict adherence and local church purity.


**Comparative Analysis of the Constitutions of Three Major Korean Presbyterian Denominations


The Korean Christian Church (Kijang), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap), and the General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong), these churches diverged in the 1950s due to theological, political, and ecclesiological differences. Their constitutions reflect distinct theological commitments, ecclesial structures, and responses to modernity, ecumenism, and gender inclusion. Below is a structured comparison of their constitutional principles.


Table 3. Comparative Overview of Constitutional Differences

| Category | Kijang (Korean Christian Church) | Tonghap (Presbyterian Church of Korea) | Hapdong (General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Table 4. Summary of Constitutional Tendencies

| Aspect | Kijang | Tonghap | Hapdong |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General Theological Orientation | Progressive | Moderate | Conservative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stance on Ecumenism | Fully Supportive | Conditional | Opposed |

| Women in Leadership | Fully Inclusive | Partially Inclusive | Exclusive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constitutional Interpretation | Contextual and Adaptive | Balanced and Practical | Literal and Protective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |


The constitutional structures of the three Presbyterian denominations reveal their broader theological and ecclesiological commitments. Kijang emphasizes progressive theology and contextual application of tradition, Tonghap balances evangelical faith with adaptive unity, and Hapdong strongly defends conservative orthodoxy and polity. These differences continue to shape their engagement with society, global Christianity, and internal governance.


Division, Unification, and the Emergence of New Denominations: Korean Methodist Church and Other Denominations

The 1950s was a transformative era for Korean Christianity. Following liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Korea faced internal religious conflict, political upheaval, and the Korean War. These challenges catalyzed divisions, reunifications, and the formation of new denominations across Protestant churches, especially within the Korean Methodist Church. These developments reflected not merely political strife but deep theological and ecclesial concerns about purity, identity, and leadership in the post-colonial church.


Division within the Methodist Church: The Rebuilding Group vs. the Revival Group

Immediately after Korea’s liberation in 1945, the Korean Methodist Church was torn apart by debates over Japan-era collaboration and theological renewal. The Rebuilding Group (Jaegeonpa), composed of figures like Lee Gyugap and Byun Honggyu, denounced the complicity of Methodist leaders who had engaged in Shinto shrine worship during the colonial period. In December 1945, they declared the reestablishment of the ""Methodist Church of Korea"" and launched separate assemblies and institutions, calling for ecclesiastical purification and the restoration of pre-1939 Methodist traditions.

In contrast, the Revival Group (Bokheungpa), led by Kang Taehee and others, emphasized revival and growth over reckoning with the past. They argued that the priority should be the church’s spiritual and organizational restoration, not political purging.

This split resulted in parallel church structures, including rival annual conferences, theological seminaries, and general assemblies. The two sides fought over church properties and authority, often resulting in disruption at the local church level.


Unification and the Founding of the Korean Methodist Church

As tensions escalated, laity groups and American Methodist missionaries, particularly Rev. Jesse W. Jones, mediated reconciliation between the factions. In April 1949, both sides agreed to dissolve their separate structures and form a unified denomination. This union was formalized at the “Unification General Assembly” at Chungdong First Methodist Church, which established the new denomination: “The Korean Methodist Church (KMC)”. Rev. Kim Yusun was elected the first general superintendent. May 1st was declared “Union Sunday,” symbolizing denominational healing. Notably, the Western Annual Conference withheld participation, and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 further hindered reconstruction efforts.


Postwar Restructuring and the Rise of Bishop Ryu Hyungki

After Kim Yusun was taken to North Korea during the war, Rev. Ryu Hyungki was elected as the new bishop in a 1951 emergency assembly in Busan. A progressive theologian trained in the U.S., Ryu introduced historical-critical methods and held liberal views, including the denial of Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. Following the war, American Methodist missions injected substantial support for reconstruction. Nearly $1 million USD was allocated to rebuild schools, hospitals, orphanages, and churches. As a result, the denomination grew significantly: from around 45,000 members in 1951 to over 120,000 by 1957.


A New Division: The Hoheon Group vs. the Ryu Hyungki Faction

Despite postwar growth, internal conflicts resumed. The most notable was the “Mission Fund Incident” (선교불사건), where a failed dollar-based trade investment led to a loss of over $30,000. Critics accused the General Board, led by Bishop Ryu, of secularizing church operations and violating church law. In response, the Hoheon Group, consisting of pastors like Kim Eungtae and Um Jaehee, formed a “Committee for Denominational Rectification” in 1954. In 1955, they established their own annual conference, elected new officers, and launched the “Hoheon Methodist Church” in opposition to what they saw as church corruption and concentration of power. This schism led to serious legal disputes over church properties and violent clashes between opposing congregants in churches such as Chungang and Dongdaemun.


Divisions in Other Denominations

Holiness Church (Sungkyul)

The Holiness Church (Seonggyeol) was divided over its stance toward the World Council of Churches (WCC). One faction supported ecumenism, while another aligned with the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE). These differing theological orientations ultimately led to organizational splits.


Baptist Church

The Korean Baptist Church, receiving support from the Southern Baptist Convention in the U.S., aimed for revitalization but eventually experienced division due to internal disputes over leadership and authority.


The 1950s was a crucible of crisis and transformation for Korean Protestantism. The Methodist Church experienced two waves of division and unification, shaped by debates over Japanese collaboration, theological direction, and denominational leadership. Similar patterns were evident in other denominations. Despite these disruptions, church membership, seminary education, and international mission support all expanded during this time, laying the groundwork for the contemporary Korean church structure.

Anti-Christian Sentiment and the Massacre of Christians During the Korean War


During the Korean War (1950–1953), anti-Christian sentiment spread across the peninsula, leading to widespread and systematic massacres of Christians. These massacres were not merely acts of religious persecution, but were deeply rooted in political and ideological conflicts, especially within the Cold War bipolar framework. The logic of ideological camps (anti-communist vs. pro-communist) served to justify violence, and Christianity, being affiliated with the pro-American, capitalist, and anti-communist bloc, became a major target for the North Korean regime and its allies.

Christianity in South Korea was closely aligned with anti-communist ideology and was supported by the U.S. military government and Syngman Rhee's administration. In the eyes of the North Korean regime and leftist forces, Christianity symbolized imperialism and ideological opposition. Thus, Christians were branded as reactionaries, imperialist agents, or enemies of the people.

In areas occupied by the North Korean army, Christian pastors, evangelists, and their families were often targeted. The classification of individuals as collaborators, reactionaries, or enemies was often arbitrary. Massacres were executed based on vague accusations or religious affiliation alone. In some areas, massacres occurred in waves: first by North Korean forces, and then again by South Korean forces after recapturing territories. This created a 'double massacre structure' in which civilians were victimized by both sides under different political labels. This double massacre structure was particularly evident in regions like Songak-myeon. Initially, during North Korean occupation, Christians and right-wing figures were executed. Later, when South Korean forces regained control, revenge killings occurred against those who had collaborated with the previous regime or were simply suspected of sympathies. This vicious cycle of retribution demonstrates the blurred lines between victim and perpetrator and illustrates the tragic entanglement of ideology and religion.

The anti-Christian movement was rooted not in pure religious animosity, but in a broader ideological campaign to eliminate perceived threats to the socialist regime. Christians, especially in leadership roles, were seen as agents of Western influence and moral opposition to the state ideology. However, not all Christians responded with partisanship. Figures like Sohn Yang-won, Seo Ki-hoon, and Kang Sung-gap chose the path of non-violence, forgiveness, and love. They refused to dehumanize their enemies and instead lived according to Gospel principles. Their martyrdom stands in contrast to the cycle of violence and offers a path toward reconciliation.

The massacres of Christians during the Korean War should not be understood solely as religious persecution but as a complex result of Cold War politics, ideological polarization, and internalized cultural dualism. Christianity in Korea was both a victim and, at times, an enabler of this violence. Yet, amidst the devastation, some individuals embodied the true essence of their faith, offering hope for peace and reconciliation.

New Religious Movement 


The 1950s in Korea were marked by liberation, war, and national division. Amidst the destruction of homes, institutional collapse, and massive displacement, people turned to religion for hope and stability. As traditional Protestant denominations became entangled in doctrinal disputes and institutional fragmentation, new forms of Christian spirituality emerged that emphasized mysticism, charismatic leaders, communal living, and eschatological visions. The most prominent examples from this era are Park Tae-seon’s Evangelical Tabernacle (Jeondogwan), Na Un-mong’s Yongmunsan Prayer Retreat, and Moon Sun-myung’s Unification Church.

Park Tae-seon proclaimed himself “the Righteous Man of the East” and founded Jeondogwan in 1955. Through a ritual called ‘anchal’ (faith healing by touch), he claimed to heal the sick and purify the body. His followers revered him as a messianic figure. Park established a self-sufficient religious community called Sion Village (Shinangchon) in Bucheon, which functioned as a semi-autonomous society. Over time, he even declared himself to be the new God, which led to increasing criticism and alienation from mainstream churches and the public.

Simultaneously, Na Un-mong’s Yongmunsan Prayer Retreat emerged as a major center of charismatic spirituality. The retreat hosted intensive prayer sessions that involved fasting, night vigils, glossolalia, and visions. Na was described as a “spiritual scientist,” and the prayer mountain became a place where collective fear and anxiety were transformed into intense spiritual experiences. Na also initiated national salvation prayer movements and influenced Korean Christian spiritual practices beyond his retreat.

Another influential figure was Moon Sun-myung, who founded the Unification Church (World Christian Gospel Mission) in Busan in 1954. He claimed to be the new messiah sent to complete the failed mission of Jesus. According to the church's central text, “Divine Principle,” Jesus' death on the cross did not fulfill God’s plan, and Moon would succeed by restoring humanity through “true parenthood” and the purification of bloodlines via “blessing marriages.” The Unification Church expanded rapidly by targeting youth and intellectuals, especially in elite universities such as Ewha Womans University and Yonsei University. The 1955 Ewha scandal, in which faculty and students were revealed to be involved with the church, caused national controversy. Despite fierce opposition from mainstream Christian denominations, the Unification Church expanded internationally and developed powerful media and political networks.

These new religious movements cannot be viewed merely as heresies but as social phenomena rooted in historical trauma. They offered direct spiritual experiences, charismatic leadership, communal belonging, and eschatological hope at a time when institutional religion failed to meet the people's emotional and existential needs. The emergence of prayer mountains, communal villages, and messianic figures reflected a deep hunger for healing, salvation, and a new world order. The 1950s was thus one of the most spiritually dynamic and turbulent decades in Korean religious history.

| Social Upheaval | Postwar destruction and displacement created collective despair. People turned to religion for hope. |

The Sacrifice of Catholic Missionaries During the Korean War


​During the Korean War (1950–1953), numerous Catholic missionaries displayed profound dedication and courage, often at the cost of their lives. Their sacrifices left an indelible mark on the Korean Catholic Church and its followers.

One prominent figure was Bishop Patrick James Byrne, an American Maryknoll missionary who served as the Apostolic Delegate to Korea. In 1950, as North Korean forces advanced into Seoul, Bishop Byrne was apprehended and subjected to the notorious ""death march"" towards the northern regions. Enduring harsh conditions, he succumbed to exhaustion and illness on November 25, 1950. His unwavering commitment to his faith and the Korean people was evident in his decision to remain with his congregation despite escalating dangers. Another notable missionary was Monsignor Thomas F. Quinlan, an Irish priest and member of the Missionary Society of St. Columban. Serving as the Prefect Apostolic of Chuncheon, he was captured during the war and endured imprisonment under severe conditions. Despite these hardships, Monsignor Quinlan survived and continued his ecclesiastical duties post-war, exemplifying resilience and dedication.

The Columban Fathers, an Irish missionary society, faced significant losses during this tumultuous period. Father Anthony Collier, stationed in Chuncheon, was the first non-Korean killed during the war, meeting his end on June 27, 1950, at the hands of North Korean soldiers. Similarly, Father Patrick Brennan, serving as the Prefect Apostolic of Gwangju, was captured and later killed on September 24, 1950. Alongside him, Fathers Thomas Cusack and John O'Brien also met martyrdom, choosing to stay with their parishioners despite imminent threats. The sacrifices of these missionaries were not in vain. In recent years, the Korean Catholic Church has initiated processes to recognize and honor these individuals. In 2022, the bishops of South Korea advanced the cause for the canonization of 81 Catholics, including foreign missionaries, who were martyred during the Korean War. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of their sacrifices on the Korean Catholic community and the enduring legacy of their faith and commitment. 

These narratives of sacrifice and unwavering faith amidst adversity highlight the profound commitment of Catholic missionaries during the Korean War. Their legacies continue to inspire and resonate within the global Catholic community.


Christianity in North Korea


Christianity in North Korea during the 1950s underwent a systematic and often violent transformation, shaped by ideological repression, war, and a deliberate campaign by the regime to dismantle religious life. The formation of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1946 by Kang Ryang-uk, Kim Il-sung’s uncle, marked the beginning of the state's efforts to co-opt Protestant leaders and align religious activities with socialist goals. Those who resisted were subjected to arrest, surveillance, or execution. In the immediate post-liberation period, North Korea housed between 2,000 and 3,000 Protestant churches, serving a community of approximately 300,000 believers, including 410 pastors, 498 evangelists, and 2,142 elders. By 1949, under growing state pressure, these numbers had declined sharply to an estimated 200,000 believers, with many churches closed or dismantled.

The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 intensified these pressures. Protestants were often associated with American influence and were perceived as traitors. Christians who welcomed or cooperated with UN forces during temporary occupations of the North were branded as enemies of the state. Many were executed or imprisoned when North Korean forces, backed by China, reestablished control. Reports indicate that of the 410 ordained pastors active before the war, at least 350 were either killed or disappeared, with only 20 to 60 surviving. Church buildings became targets during U.S. bombings and also by North Korean authorities post-conflict, with over 500 out of 3,000 churches destroyed or repurposed. Public religious activity ceased, and only clandestine house churches remained, hidden in homes, mountains, or remote caves.

Following the war, in December 1953, Kim Il-sung announced a new policy of ideological re-education aimed directly at religious youth. This marked the start of institutionalized atheism and systematic anti-religious campaigns. The 1955 directive 'On Intensifying Class Education' and the 1958 decision 'On the Mass Struggle Against Anti-Revolutionary Elements' formalized the state’s stance: Protestants were officially categorized within the 'hostile class' under the Songbun system. Between 1958 and 1960, approximately 450,000 people from 100,000 religious households were classified as reactionaries and forcibly relocated to remote areas such as North Hamgyong Province. The repression extended to every aspect of life, from employment and education to residence and social status. In schools, religious children were encouraged to report on their parents, and anti-religious propaganda films and literature were widely circulated. Christians were imprisoned, executed, or expelled, and even those with mere familial ties to Christianity faced discrimination and relocation.

Despite the nearly complete destruction of public religious life, remnants of faith survived through underground gatherings and household worship. These secret congregations were small, often composed of family members, and met irregularly. Though limited in scope, they preserved core aspects of Protestant identity and practice, including prayer, hymn singing, and moral teachings. The persistence of these groups laid the foundation for the emergence of underground churches in the 1980s and 1990s. The regime's brutal efforts to erase Christianity during the 1950s were largely successful in suppressing institutional religion, but they failed to eliminate belief itself, which continued to circulate quietly within households across the country.


The following table provides a summary of the major characteristics of Christianity in North Korea during the 1950s:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Formal Christianity | Korean Christian Federation (KCF), used for propaganda |
| --- | --- |
| Actual Christianity | Underground or house churches, small gatherings in secret |
| --- | --- |
| Suppression Methods | Surveillance, job/education discrimination, executions, forced labor |
| --- | --- |
| Transformation | Traditional churches replaced by underground communities |
| --- | --- |
| International Context | Support for UN/US led to justification of persecution by North Korean regime |

 Summary of Regulations


South Korea


The First Republic of Korea (1948–1960) was a formative period in which the political, social, and ideological foundations of the new state were established. Among these, religion emerged as both a cultural force and a mechanism of governance. Under President Syngman Rhee, whose political vision was deeply rooted in Protestant Christianity, the religious policy of the First Republic reveals a dual structure: the promotion of Christianity as a core national identity and the state's strategic involvement in managing other religious communities. This paper provides an objective analysis of the First Republic's religious policies, particularly focusing on the institutional promotion of Christianity and the state's role in shaping the religious landscape of post-liberation Korea.

The 1948 Constitution of the Republic of Korea enshrined the principle of religious freedom and the separation of religion and state (Article 20). However, in practice, the Rhee administration implemented a range of policies that strongly favored Christianity, particularly Protestantism, while engaging selectively with other religious traditions. This gap between constitutional ideals and practical governance reveals the complex interplay of ideology, religion, and statecraft in early Korean democracy.

President Rhee, educated and baptized in the United States, viewed Christianity as not only a personal faith but also a civilizational foundation for national development. In his 1945 speech at Jeongdong First Methodist Church, he stated his intention to ""build the nation on the Bible."" This vision materialized in symbolic and institutional forms: Christian rituals were adopted in the 1948 National Assembly opening and presidential inauguration, and Protestant leaders like Rev. Lee Yoon-young played ceremonial roles in state functions.

Institutionally, Christianity was embedded into various sectors:

The military chaplain system and prison ministry (hyeongmok system) were implemented, primarily under Protestant and Catholic leadership.

Christian media institutions such as CBS (1954) and Far East Broadcasting Company (1956) were established with state approval.

Numerous high-level government officials were practicing Christians, creating a visible religious preference in governance.

Christian lawmakers were significantly represented in the Constituent Assembly (estimated 21–24% of members), disproportionately high compared to the national Christian population at the time (0.5–2%).


Christianity became aligned with the state’s ideological opposition to communism, especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The persecution of Christians in North Korea, including the martyrdom of figures such as Rev. Son Yang-won, was highlighted to construct Christianity as a bulwark of anti-communism and moral resistance. Churches and Christian institutions supported state campaigns in education, military morale, and national reconstruction.

Christian groups also supported land reform policies. Rhee's 1949–50 land reform, which dismantled the landlord-tenant structure of colonial Korea and transitioned tenant farmers into landowners, was positively evaluated from a Christian worldview emphasizing economic justice and love-based governance. The land reform reduced inequality and contributed to the foundation of economic modernization.


While Christianity received state endorsement, other religions experienced selective engagement, state-led reform, and in some cases, coercive control. In 1954, amid conflict between celibate (bigu) monks and married clergy (daecheo seung), the Rhee administration issued the ""Purification Edict,"" recognizing the former as legitimate. While the edict facilitated institutional reform and monastic consolidation, it also constituted an unconstitutional state intervention, as condemned by the National Assembly.The state's involvement set a precedent for political entanglement in Buddhist affairs that reverberated into the late 20th century.

Between 1956 and 1964, the Confucian community was divided between the 'Nong-eun' and 'Orthodox' factions. Although a Christian, Rhee was endorsed as president of the Confucian Yudohoe by the Nong-eun group. His acceptance contributed to the marginalization of traditional leaders like Kim Chang-sook and raised concerns about religious neutrality in governance.

Emergent religious movements were often labeled as ""pseudo-religions"" or ""heresies"" and subjected to police surveillance or outright suppression. In several cases, leaders of new religious groups were arrested, and their organizations forcibly disbanded, in contravention of constitutional protections.

A notable area of church-state conflict was the dispute over mandatory flag salutes (kukgi baerye), particularly in Presbyterian circles. Rooted in a historical resistance to Shinto shrine worship under Japanese rule, some Christians interpreted the bowing to the national flag as a form of idolatry. Prominent Christian leaders, such as Rev. Sohn Yang-won and Pastor Lee Won-young, publicly opposed the practice, leading to legal and social confrontations between churches and schools enforcing patriotic rituals.

The First Republic's religious policies enabled the rapid institutional growth of Christianity and its integration into state ideology. Simultaneously, these policies disrupted the autonomy of other religious traditions and weakened their internal governance. While Christianity benefited from state support, it also became entangled with political power, leading to long-term challenges in maintaining religious neutrality and public trust.

The religious policy of the First Republic was a complex system shaped by the theological convictions of its leadership, the exigencies of Cold War politics, and the sociopolitical restructuring of post-colonial Korea. Christianity was not merely favored but structurally embedded in the state's vision of modernization and anti-communism. Conversely, the state's interventions in Buddhism, Confucianism, and new religions illustrate how religious diversity was managed through selective support and strategic control. These dynamics have left a lasting imprint on the relationship between religion and state in South Korea.

North Korea


Post-Liberation Period (1945–1948): Limited Coexistence and Political Instrumentalization

Following liberation in 1945, Christianity remained a powerful social force in North Korea. Christian leaders like Cho Man-sik were viewed as advocates of democratic order. In October 1945, Kim Il Sung reportedly instructed Kang Ryang-uk, “Bring progressive and influential pastors and elders into the fold, so that Christians will gain correct awareness of our righteous cause for building a new democratic Korea.” As a result, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) was founded in Pyongyang on November 28, 1946, with Kang Ryang-uk as chairman. The KCF's platform declared its goal to “awaken patriotism based on Christian principles of love and to participate in the national construction project.” However, internally, the KCF was a tool for weakening and absorbing the independent church. According to Kim Yang-sun, a pastor who defected to the South, the KCF's real purpose was to “foment internal division and drive the church to self-destruction.”


Regime Establishment and War Period (1948–1953): Systematic Persecution and Emergence of the Underground Church

After the establishment of the DPRK in 1948, Christianity was redefined as a “remnant of imperialist ideology” and associated with American espionage. During the Korean War, Christians were accused of collaborating with UN forces, leading to mass arrests, executions, and forced disappearances. Pastor Yoo Sahyun, who defected to the South in 1952, recalled that “five or six believers gathered in secret, shedding tears in prayer,” indicating the shift of religious life into secrecy. Following the war, the equation “Christian = spy” became entrenched, and even home-based religious activity was criminalized and surveilled. Incidents such as the hymnal case in Pakcheon County (1959) and the cross incident at Wonsan Railway Factory (1960) show that some believers still tried to worship in secret.


Postwar Era (1953–1960): Atheism Campaigns and Dismantling of Public Religion

After the war, the North Korean regime initiated a comprehensive atheism campaign. The book Why Do We Oppose Religion? (1959) by Chong Ha-chol defined Christianity as “a belief in divine power that undermines socialist construction by replacing self-effort with the will of God.” The 1957 Iman-hwa case in Yongcheon County—where a pastor was prosecuted for refusing to vote—illustrates how Christian dissent was framed as anti-socialist behavior. As a result, “all official Christian activity in North Korea ceased between 1958 and 1972.” During this period, Christianity survived only as a clandestine faith practiced in underground networks, many of which were infiltrated or dissolved.

Inter-Korean Unification Policies and Religious Roles 


1945-50: Division and War—Hostile Policies and Religious Suppression

In the South, President Syngman Rhee advanced a ""northward reunification"" policy, grounded in anti-communism and the claim that the Republic of Korea was the sole legitimate government on the peninsula. Religious institutions, especially Protestant churches, supported the regime and became entwined with state-led anti-communist campaigns.

In the North, the state pursued the ""Democratic Base Theory”a strategy to export socialist revolution from the North to the South. Christianity was violently suppressed as a pro-American and counter-revolutionary force. Thousands of pastors and believers fled to the South or were imprisoned. The Korean Christian Federation (Josŏn Kidokkyo-do Yŏnmaeng) was established in 1946 to serve as a nominal religious body under state control.

"
"1","


Hostility toward Christianity in 1950s Korean society cannot be understood simply as a manifestation of anti-religious sentiment or interreligious conflict. Rather, it emerged out of a complex historical context shaped by liberation, national division, and war, during which Christianity became deeply entangled in politics, society, and culture. In this period, Christianity played a central role in postwar recovery and humanitarian efforts but was also criticized for its association with foreign powers, monopolization of authority, and internal factionalism.

Following the outbreak of the Korean War, Christian churches—particularly those led by northern refugees affiliated with the Presbyterian Church—took the lead in relief and reconstruction efforts. Through close partnerships with American missionaries and church networks, they secured significant amounts of aid and humanitarian resources. This positioned them as key power brokers in both the church and society. However, this monopolization of aid and leadership led to conflict with other Christian groups, especially those from the Koryŏ-sin (Ko-Shin) and Chosŏn Theological Seminary (KiJang) traditions. These groups were marginalized, often accused of heresy, and pushed out of mainstream denominational structures. As a result, Christianity came to be seen by the public not as a moral or spiritual community but as an exclusive and power-driven institution. Another source of criticism was the church’s close association with foreign powers, particularly the United States. American churches and missionaries supported Korea’s Christians with money, personnel, and material aid, but this also reinforced the image of Christianity as foreign, Western, and anti-communist. This perception contributed to a growing belief that Christianity was aligned with U.S. imperial interests and the anti-communist agenda of the Syngman Rhee government. For nationalist intellectuals and youth disillusioned by American influence, Christianity appeared complicit in foreign domination. Moreover, the collaboration between Christian leaders and the authoritarian regime under Syngman Rhee added to this negative perception. Church figures often supported Rhee’s anti-communist rhetoric and were publicly praised by the government. This blurred the lines between political and religious authority, further reinforcing the belief that the church was entangled with state power.

Despite these criticisms, it would be inaccurate to dismiss the role of Christianity in Korean society during this period as entirely negative. Many missionaries and Korean Christian leaders engaged in genuine humanitarian work: caring for refugees, providing medical services, operating orphanages and widow shelters, and rebuilding war-torn communities. American churches led national campaigns to raise funds and send aid to Korea. These efforts not only alleviated suffering but also helped lay the foundations for modern social welfare and education systems in South Korea. In the long run, Christianity contributed to the internalization of democratic values, civic ethics, and the development of civil society in the postwar era. Christianity, by virtue of its visibility and influence, inevitably drew both praise and criticism. Its rise to prominence amid national trauma and reconstruction created tensions across social groups, generating a complex mixture of trust and hostility. However, this hostility was not born of blind rejection. It was a reflection of Christianity’s historical positioning—as a moral force, political actor, and cultural mediator—in a society undergoing radical transformation."

South Korea

Between 1945 and 1960, South Korea’s diplomatic, religious, and national identity evolved in dynamic and often turbulent ways, with Christianity playing a central role in shaping both domestic and international relationships. During this time, the country’s interactions with neighboring Asian-Pacific states, particularly North Korea, China, and Japan, and with Christian-majority nations such as the United States and Canada, were deeply influenced by religious, political, and ideological factors. Concurrently, expressions of nationalism and patriotism emerged in complex forms, often interwoven with Christian sentiment, public rituals, and anti-communist ideology.

After liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, South Korea’s relationship with North Korea quickly devolved into ideological opposition that culminated in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The war marked a defining moment in the South’s assertion of identity, with Christianity positioned as a moral and spiritual force against atheistic communism. In the North, Christian churches were suppressed and believers persecuted; pastors were arrested, churches were closed, and many Christians fled to the South. Estimates suggest that two-thirds of the clergy in North Korea relocated southward, where they contributed to the growth of the Christian community. For missionaries and South Korean leaders alike, the war was not merely a military conflict but also a religious and civilizational struggle. The perceived clash between a Christian South and a communist North elevated the role of Christianity in state ideology and contributed to the consolidation of national unity under the banner of anti-communism. 

South Korea’s postwar stance toward Japan was largely shaped by historical resentment stemming from its colonial past. While diplomatic ties remained limited during this period, Christian institutions benefited from this estrangement. American and Canadian missionaries, in particular, were viewed as symbols of non-colonial benevolence in contrast to Japanese imperial oppression. This perception bolstered the legitimacy and influence of Christian missions in Korea, especially in rural and war-torn regions. During the war, Japan also functioned as a logistical and temporary humanitarian base for missionaries who were evacuated from the peninsula. Canadian and American missionaries stationed in Seoul and other cities fled to Japan in the early days of the conflict, only to return later to continue relief and evangelistic work.

China’s involvement in the Korean War further complicated South Korea’s regional relationships. Before the Chinese entry into the war in late 1950, some missionaries held out hope that Christian work might continue on the mainland. However, China’s intervention dashed such expectations, positioning the Chinese Communist regime as a clear adversary of South Korean Christianity. American and Canadian missionaries interpreted China’s actions not just as military aggression but as part of a broader communist threat to the Christian presence in Asia. As China became more closely aligned with North Korea, the ideological and theological divide in East Asia became more pronounced.

South Korea’s relationship with the United States during this period was marked by deep military, political, and religious cooperation. American Protestant missionaries had laid the groundwork for Christianity in Korea since the late 19th century, establishing schools, hospitals, and churches that became pivotal institutions in Korean society. During the Korean War, this relationship deepened. The United States, through the United Nations Command, became South Korea’s primary military protector. Simultaneously, American churches, missionaries, and Christian organizations mobilized spiritual and material support for Korea, presenting the conflict as a defense of Christian civilization. The World Council of Churches formally condemned North Korea’s aggression and endorsed the UN military action, reinforcing the belief that the war was a moral as well as political battle. American missionaries often served as chaplains to Korean troops and civilians, helping to interpret the war through a Christian lens and providing essential humanitarian aid in the midst of destruction.

Canada also maintained significant missionary and theological ties with Korea. Canadian missionaries had been active in northern Korea since the early 20th century, especially in Hamheung and the surrounding provinces. Following the division of Korea and the rise of communism in the North, Canadian missionaries hoped to return to their former mission fields, but the war and political changes made that impossible. Nevertheless, Canadian missionaries continued to support Korean Christians through their work in Seoul and southern regions, often ministering to northern refugees. Figures such as Florence Murray played leading roles in wartime medical and relief work, while others maintained educational and theological ministries despite repeated evacuations. These missionaries saw in Korea not only a spiritual calling but also a strategic battleground in the fight against communism, echoing broader Cold War sentiments prevalent in Western churches.

Expressions of nationalism and patriotism during this era were deeply intertwined with Christian ideology. After liberation, the growth of Christian schools, hospitals, and churches was not only a matter of religious development but also a nationalistic endeavor. Mission schools like Ewha Girls’ School and Pai Chai Haktang became centers of civic awakening and national pride. Their curricula emphasized not just religious instruction but also liberal arts education, physical training, and public speaking, all intended to develop leaders for an independent Korean nation. Students participated in national ceremonies and were often involved in pro-independence movements. Christianity thus played a formative role in shaping a modern, educated, and politically conscious Korean identity.

During the Korean War, nationalism was often expressed through religious symbols and rituals. Revival meetings, mass prayer gatherings, and public confessions of sin took on patriotic overtones. The church became both a refuge from war and a space for the cultivation of national spirit. Sermons often fused biblical narratives with themes of national suffering and redemption. Christian leaders emphasized that faith in Christ and loyalty to the nation were mutually reinforcing commitments. Public mourning for the war dead, prayers for national survival, and acts of charity were seen not only as Christian duties but as patriotic acts. In this context, the border between religious devotion and civic nationalism became increasingly blurred. The press and public discourse during this decade also reflected these sentiments. Newspapers and Christian publications described Korea as a “chosen nation” destined to resist communism and lead Asia in spiritual renewal. Anti-communist propaganda often relied on religious metaphors, and many church leaders were celebrated as national heroes. Christianity, especially Protestantism, was portrayed as a modernizing force capable of saving Korea from both its feudal past and the threat of totalitarianism. Even secular leaders like President Syngman Rhee, himself a devout Christian, invoked Christian rhetoric to frame national policy and foreign relations.

In summary, between 1945 and 1960, South Korea’s relationships with neighboring countries and Christian-majority nations were shaped not only by military and political factors but also by deep religious convictions. Christianity provided a framework through which Koreans interpreted war, occupation, independence, and national purpose. American and Canadian missionaries were more than religious figures; they were builders of civil society, allies in ideological warfare, and participants in Korea’s national drama. In return, Korean Christians embraced faith as both a spiritual refuge and a patriotic duty, contributing to the remarkable expansion of Christianity during a time of national trauma and transformation.


North Korea

In the 1950s, Christianity in North Korea was not merely perceived as a religious practice but rather as a fundamental threat to the regime. This perception was deeply shaped by North Korea's diplomatic relations with neighboring countries and the broader international climate. Following liberation, North Korea, under the strong influence of the Soviet Union, quickly adopted a socialist system and embraced an atheistic ideology, which fundamentally rejected religion as antithetical to state ideology. Christianity, particularly, was seen as a symbol of Western civilization tied to the United States, which led North Korean authorities to brand it as an extension of imperialism and a tool of counterrevolution.

The relationship with the Soviet Union played a foundational role in shaping North Korea’s religious policies. As the North modeled its state apparatus on Stalinist socialism, religion was completely rejected and categorized as superstition. To ensure ideological conformity and social unity, churches were shut down and Christians were labeled as spies or reactionaries. Clergy and believers often ended up in labor camps or faced public execution. This ideological alignment with the Soviet model provided the justification for systemic religious persecution.

North Korea's relations with China also significantly impacted its policy toward religion. During the Korean War, China's military intervention through the People's Volunteer Army was pivotal to North Korea's survival. This event led to closer strategic cooperation between the two nations. At the same time, China was suppressing Christianity as a remnant of bourgeois influence, especially during the lead-up to the Cultural Revolution. North Korea and China thus shared a common stance on religion and coordinated their efforts to eliminate Christianity, treating it as a hindrance to the construction of socialist ideology.

Hostility toward the United States further intensified the repression of Christianity. As North Korea's most prominent adversary, the U.S. was viewed not only as a military threat but also as a cultural and ideological one. Christianity, associated with American influence, was treated as a subversive force. Christians were accused of being collaborators with U.S. forces or South Korean intelligence, and religious activities were treated as acts of treason. Churches were closed, Bibles were burned, and many believers went underground. Persecution was not solely due to religious beliefs, but because Christianity was framed as a tool of American imperialism.

In relation to Japan, North Korea kept a close watch on Korean Christian communities among Zainichi Koreans. Many of these communities were centered around churches in Japan. However, the North saw Christian churches as a threat to ideological unity and attempted to control religious activity through pro-Pyongyang organizations like Chongryon. Religious organizations were sidelined in favor of ideological education through Korean schools, reflecting Pyongyang’s effort to neutralize Christianity’s influence among the diasporas.

Additionally, North Korea began diplomatic outreach to neutral or non-aligned countries in the late 1950s. In doing so, it treated international criticism of religious repression as an imperialist attack and an interference in domestic affairs. North Korea strategically ignored or downplayed religious freedom issues on the global stage while reinforcing domestic repression. The support of fellow socialist states enabled North Korea to justify its severe treatment of Christians as a necessary measure to protect its regime from ideological threats.

In sum, religious persecution in North Korea during the 1950s was not just a matter of internal policy but a calculated response to its international environment. Its relationships with the Soviet Union and China encouraged anti-religious campaigns, while antagonism toward the U.S. fueled its portrayal of Christianity as an enemy ideology. Even interactions with Japan and neutral states played a role in shaping how the North Korean regime isolated and suppressed Christianity. The repression of religion during this decade was deeply interwoven with North Korea’s broader foreign policy and survival strategy.
