"1","Anti-Christian Sentiment and the Massacre of Christians During the Korean War


During the Korean War (1950–1953), anti-Christian sentiment spread across the peninsula, leading to widespread and systematic massacres of Christians. These massacres were not merely acts of religious persecution, but were deeply rooted in political and ideological conflicts, especially within the Cold War bipolar framework. The logic of ideological camps (anti-communist vs. pro-communist) served to justify violence, and Christianity, being affiliated with the pro-American, capitalist, and anti-communist bloc, became a major target for the North Korean regime and its allies.

Christianity in South Korea was closely aligned with anti-communist ideology and was supported by the U.S. military government and Syngman Rhee's administration. In the eyes of the North Korean regime and leftist forces, Christianity symbolized imperialism and ideological opposition. Thus, Christians were branded as reactionaries, imperialist agents, or enemies of the people.

In areas occupied by the North Korean army, Christian pastors, evangelists, and their families were often targeted. The classification of individuals as collaborators, reactionaries, or enemies was often arbitrary. Massacres were executed based on vague accusations or religious affiliation alone. In some areas, massacres occurred in waves: first by North Korean forces, and then again by South Korean forces after recapturing territories. This created a 'double massacre structure' in which civilians were victimized by both sides under different political labels. This double massacre structure was particularly evident in regions like Songak-myeon. Initially, during North Korean occupation, Christians and right-wing figures were executed. Later, when South Korean forces regained control, revenge killings occurred against those who had collaborated with the previous regime or were simply suspected of sympathies. This vicious cycle of retribution demonstrates the blurred lines between victim and perpetrator and illustrates the tragic entanglement of ideology and religion.

The anti-Christian movement was rooted not in pure religious animosity, but in a broader ideological campaign to eliminate perceived threats to the socialist regime. Christians, especially in leadership roles, were seen as agents of Western influence and moral opposition to the state ideology. However, not all Christians responded with partisanship. Figures like Sohn Yang-won, Seo Ki-hoon, and Kang Sung-gap chose the path of non-violence, forgiveness, and love. They refused to dehumanize their enemies and instead lived according to Gospel principles. Their martyrdom stands in contrast to the cycle of violence and offers a path toward reconciliation.

The massacres of Christians during the Korean War should not be understood solely as religious persecution but as a complex result of Cold War politics, ideological polarization, and internalized cultural dualism. Christianity in Korea was both a victim and, at times, an enabler of this violence. Yet, amidst the devastation, some individuals embodied the true essence of their faith, offering hope for peace and reconciliation.

New Religious Movement 


The 1950s in Korea were marked by liberation, war, and national division. Amidst the destruction of homes, institutional collapse, and massive displacement, people turned to religion for hope and stability. As traditional Protestant denominations became entangled in doctrinal disputes and institutional fragmentation, new forms of Christian spirituality emerged that emphasized mysticism, charismatic leaders, communal living, and eschatological visions. The most prominent examples from this era are Park Tae-seon’s Evangelical Tabernacle (Jeondogwan), Na Un-mong’s Yongmunsan Prayer Retreat, and Moon Sun-myung’s Unification Church.

Park Tae-seon proclaimed himself “the Righteous Man of the East” and founded Jeondogwan in 1955. Through a ritual called ‘anchal’ (faith healing by touch), he claimed to heal the sick and purify the body. His followers revered him as a messianic figure. Park established a self-sufficient religious community called Sion Village (Shinangchon) in Bucheon, which functioned as a semi-autonomous society. Over time, he even declared himself to be the new God, which led to increasing criticism and alienation from mainstream churches and the public.

Simultaneously, Na Un-mong’s Yongmunsan Prayer Retreat emerged as a major center of charismatic spirituality. The retreat hosted intensive prayer sessions that involved fasting, night vigils, glossolalia, and visions. Na was described as a “spiritual scientist,” and the prayer mountain became a place where collective fear and anxiety were transformed into intense spiritual experiences. Na also initiated national salvation prayer movements and influenced Korean Christian spiritual practices beyond his retreat.

Another influential figure was Moon Sun-myung, who founded the Unification Church (World Christian Gospel Mission) in Busan in 1954. He claimed to be the new messiah sent to complete the failed mission of Jesus. According to the church's central text, “Divine Principle,” Jesus' death on the cross did not fulfill God’s plan, and Moon would succeed by restoring humanity through “true parenthood” and the purification of bloodlines via “blessing marriages.” The Unification Church expanded rapidly by targeting youth and intellectuals, especially in elite universities such as Ewha Womans University and Yonsei University. The 1955 Ewha scandal, in which faculty and students were revealed to be involved with the church, caused national controversy. Despite fierce opposition from mainstream Christian denominations, the Unification Church expanded internationally and developed powerful media and political networks.

These new religious movements cannot be viewed merely as heresies but as social phenomena rooted in historical trauma. They offered direct spiritual experiences, charismatic leadership, communal belonging, and eschatological hope at a time when institutional religion failed to meet the people's emotional and existential needs. The emergence of prayer mountains, communal villages, and messianic figures reflected a deep hunger for healing, salvation, and a new world order. The 1950s was thus one of the most spiritually dynamic and turbulent decades in Korean religious history.

The Sacrifice of Catholic Missionaries During the Korean War


​During the Korean War (1950–1953), numerous Catholic missionaries displayed profound dedication and courage, often at the cost of their lives. Their sacrifices left an indelible mark on the Korean Catholic Church and its followers.

One prominent figure was Bishop Patrick James Byrne, an American Maryknoll missionary who served as the Apostolic Delegate to Korea. In 1950, as North Korean forces advanced into Seoul, Bishop Byrne was apprehended and subjected to the notorious ""death march"" towards the northern regions. Enduring harsh conditions, he succumbed to exhaustion and illness on November 25, 1950. His unwavering commitment to his faith and the Korean people was evident in his decision to remain with his congregation despite escalating dangers. Another notable missionary was Monsignor Thomas F. Quinlan, an Irish priest and member of the Missionary Society of St. Columban. Serving as the Prefect Apostolic of Chuncheon, he was captured during the war and endured imprisonment under severe conditions. Despite these hardships, Monsignor Quinlan survived and continued his ecclesiastical duties post-war, exemplifying resilience and dedication.

The Columban Fathers, an Irish missionary society, faced significant losses during this tumultuous period. Father Anthony Collier, stationed in Chuncheon, was the first non-Korean killed during the war, meeting his end on June 27, 1950, at the hands of North Korean soldiers. Similarly, Father Patrick Brennan, serving as the Prefect Apostolic of Gwangju, was captured and later killed on September 24, 1950. Alongside him, Fathers Thomas Cusack and John O'Brien also met martyrdom, choosing to stay with their parishioners despite imminent threats. The sacrifices of these missionaries were not in vain. In recent years, the Korean Catholic Church has initiated processes to recognize and honor these individuals. In 2022, the bishops of South Korea advanced the cause for the canonization of 81 Catholics, including foreign missionaries, who were martyred during the Korean War. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of their sacrifices on the Korean Catholic community and the enduring legacy of their faith and commitment. 

These narratives of sacrifice and unwavering faith amidst adversity highlight the profound commitment of Catholic missionaries during the Korean War. Their legacies continue to inspire and resonate within the global Catholic community.


Christianity in North Korea


Christianity in North Korea during the 1950s underwent a systematic and often violent transformation, shaped by ideological repression, war, and a deliberate campaign by the regime to dismantle religious life. The formation of the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) in 1946 by Kang Ryang-uk, Kim Il-sung’s uncle, marked the beginning of the state's efforts to co-opt Protestant leaders and align religious activities with socialist goals. Those who resisted were subjected to arrest, surveillance, or execution. In the immediate post-liberation period, North Korea housed between 2,000 and 3,000 Protestant churches, serving a community of approximately 300,000 believers, including 410 pastors, 498 evangelists, and 2,142 elders. By 1949, under growing state pressure, these numbers had declined sharply to an estimated 200,000 believers, with many churches closed or dismantled.

The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 intensified these pressures. Protestants were often associated with American influence and were perceived as traitors. Christians who welcomed or cooperated with UN forces during temporary occupations of the North were branded as enemies of the state. Many were executed or imprisoned when North Korean forces, backed by China, reestablished control. Reports indicate that of the 410 ordained pastors active before the war, at least 350 were either killed or disappeared, with only 20 to 60 surviving. Church buildings became targets during U.S. bombings and also by North Korean authorities post-conflict, with over 500 out of 3,000 churches destroyed or repurposed. Public religious activity ceased, and only clandestine house churches remained, hidden in homes, mountains, or remote caves.

Following the war, in December 1953, Kim Il-sung announced a new policy of ideological re-education aimed directly at religious youth. This marked the start of institutionalized atheism and systematic anti-religious campaigns. The 1955 directive 'On Intensifying Class Education' and the 1958 decision 'On the Mass Struggle Against Anti-Revolutionary Elements' formalized the state’s stance: Protestants were officially categorized within the 'hostile class' under the Songbun system. Between 1958 and 1960, approximately 450,000 people from 100,000 religious households were classified as reactionaries and forcibly relocated to remote areas such as North Hamgyong Province. The repression extended to every aspect of life, from employment and education to residence and social status. In schools, religious children were encouraged to report on their parents, and anti-religious propaganda films and literature were widely circulated. Christians were imprisoned, executed, or expelled, and even those with mere familial ties to Christianity faced discrimination and relocation.

Despite the nearly complete destruction of public religious life, remnants of faith survived through underground gatherings and household worship. These secret congregations were small, often composed of family members, and met irregularly. Though limited in scope, they preserved core aspects of Protestant identity and practice, including prayer, hymn singing, and moral teachings. The persistence of these groups laid the foundation for the emergence of underground churches in the 1980s and 1990s. The regime's brutal efforts to erase Christianity during the 1950s were largely successful in suppressing institutional religion, but they failed to eliminate belief itself, which continued to circulate quietly within households across the country.


The following table provides a summary of the major characteristics of Christianity in North Korea during the 1950s:
