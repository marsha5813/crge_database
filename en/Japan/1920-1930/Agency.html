Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).
</p>
<p>
Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

<p>
Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

<p></p>
<p>
Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

<p>
The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

<p>
The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)
</p>
<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<p>
<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>





<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.
<p></p>
<p>
This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>

<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities. It was due to the gradual coIn particular, Iwashita Soichi(Â≤©‰∏ãÂ£Æ‰∏Ä), Yoshimitsu Yoshi hiko(ÂêâÊ∫ÄÁæ©ÂΩ¶), Tozuka Bunkei (Êà∏Â°öÊñáÂçø), and Kotaro Tanaka(Kotaro Tanaka) formed a group of Catholic thinkers (Miyoshi, 98). After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99). Iwashita baptized both Totsuka and Tanaka.nsolidation of Catholic higher education institutions in Japanese culture. Therefore, Iwashita was the central figure of the Catholic Thought Society at that time.</mark>

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.

Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).
</p>
<p>
Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

<p>
Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

<p></p>
<p>
Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

<p>
The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)
</p>
<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>

<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.

This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

<mark>In the 1920s, various religions, including Christianity, were featured in magazines. For example, general magazines ran features on religion, such as ‚ÄúLife and Religion Issue‚Äù (Shin Shosetsu Êñ∞Â∞èË™¨, March issue) and ‚ÄúReligion Issue‚Äù (Shufu no Tomo ‰∏ªÂ©¶„ÅÆÂèã, March issue). In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities. It was due to the gradual coIn particular, Iwashita Soichi(Â≤©‰∏ãÂ£Æ‰∏Ä), Yoshimitsu Yoshi hiko(ÂêâÊ∫ÄÁæ©ÂΩ¶), Tozuka Bunkei (Êà∏Â°öÊñáÂçø), and Kotaro Tanaka(Kotaro Tanaka) formed a group of Catholic thinkers (Miyoshi, 98). After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99). Iwashita baptized both Totsuka and Tanaka.nsolidation of Catholic higher education institutions in Japanese culture. Therefore, Iwashita was the central figure of the Catholic Thought Society at that time.</mark>

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.

Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).

Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

<p>
Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

<p></p>
<p>
Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

<p>
The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

(As of September 30, 1925.)
</p>
<p>
The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)
</p>
<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>





<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.
<p></p>
<p>
This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

<mark>In the 1920s, various religions, including Christianity, were featured in magazines. For example, general magazines ran features on religion, such as ‚ÄúLife and Religion Issue‚Äù (Shin Shosetsu Êñ∞Â∞èË™¨, March issue) and ‚ÄúReligion Issue‚Äù (Shufu no Tomo ‰∏ªÂ©¶„ÅÆÂèã, March issue). In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>

<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities. It was due to the gradual coIn particular, Iwashita Soichi(Â≤©‰∏ãÂ£Æ‰∏Ä), Yoshimitsu Yoshi hiko(ÂêâÊ∫ÄÁæ©ÂΩ¶), Tozuka Bunkei (Êà∏Â°öÊñáÂçø), and Kotaro Tanaka(Kotaro Tanaka) formed a group of Catholic thinkers (Miyoshi, 98). After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99). Iwashita baptized both Totsuka and Tanaka.nsolidation of Catholic higher education institutions in Japanese culture.

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.

Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).

Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

<p>
Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

<p>
The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

</p>
<p>
The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)
</p>
<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<p>
<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>





<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.
<p></p>
<p>
This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

<mark>In the 1920s, various religions, including Christianity, were featured in magazines. For example, general magazines ran features on religion, such as ‚ÄúLife and Religion Issue‚Äù (Shin Shosetsu Êñ∞Â∞èË™¨, March issue) and ‚ÄúReligion Issue‚Äù (Shufu no Tomo ‰∏ªÂ©¶„ÅÆÂèã, March issue). In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>

<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities.

After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99). Iwashita baptized both Totsuka and Tanaka.nsolidation of Catholic higher education institutions in Japanese culture.

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.

Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).
</p>
<p>
Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).

On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

<p></p>
<p>
Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

<p>
The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

</p>
<p>
The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)
</p>
<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>

<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>





<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.
<p></p>
<p>
This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

<mark>In the 1920s, various religions, including Christianity, were featured in magazines. For example, general magazines ran features on religion, such as ‚ÄúLife and Religion Issue‚Äù (Shin Shosetsu Êñ∞Â∞èË™¨, March issue) and ‚ÄúReligion Issue‚Äù (Shufu no Tomo ‰∏ªÂ©¶„ÅÆÂèã, March issue). In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>

<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities. It was due to the gradual coIn particular, Iwashita Soichi(Â≤©‰∏ãÂ£Æ‰∏Ä), Yoshimitsu Yoshi hiko(ÂêâÊ∫ÄÁæ©ÂΩ¶), Tozuka Bunkei (Êà∏Â°öÊñáÂçø), and Kotaro Tanaka(Kotaro Tanaka) formed a group of Catholic thinkers (Miyoshi, 98). After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99).

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.

Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).
</p>
<p>
Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

<p>
Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

<p></p>
<p>
Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

<p>
The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)

<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<p>
<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>





<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.
<p></p>
<p>
This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

<mark>In the 1920s, various religions, including Christianity, were featured in magazines. For example, general magazines ran features on religion, such as ‚ÄúLife and Religion Issue‚Äù (Shin Shosetsu Êñ∞Â∞èË™¨, March issue) and ‚ÄúReligion Issue‚Äù (Shufu no Tomo ‰∏ªÂ©¶„ÅÆÂèã, March issue). In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>

<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities. It was due to the gradual coIn particular, Iwashita Soichi(Â≤©‰∏ãÂ£Æ‰∏Ä), Yoshimitsu Yoshi hiko(ÂêâÊ∫ÄÁæ©ÂΩ¶), Tozuka Bunkei (Êà∏Â°öÊñáÂçø), and Kotaro Tanaka(Kotaro Tanaka) formed a group of Catholic thinkers (Miyoshi, 98). After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99). Iwashita baptized both Totsuka and Tanaka.nsolidation of Catholic higher education institutions in Japanese culture.

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.

Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).
</p>
<p>
Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

<p>
Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

<p></p>
<p>
Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

<p>
The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

<p>
The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)
</p>
<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<p>
<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>





<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.
<p></p>
<p>
This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>

<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities. It was due to the gradual coIn particular, Iwashita Soichi(Â≤©‰∏ãÂ£Æ‰∏Ä), Yoshimitsu Yoshi hiko(ÂêâÊ∫ÄÁæ©ÂΩ¶), Tozuka Bunkei (Êà∏Â°öÊñáÂçø), and Kotaro Tanaka(Kotaro Tanaka) formed a group of Catholic thinkers (Miyoshi, 98). After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99). Iwashita baptized both Totsuka and Tanaka.nsolidation of Catholic higher education institutions in Japanese culture. Therefore, Iwashita was the central figure of the Catholic Thought Society at that time.</mark>

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.

Ebina Danjo(Êµ∑ËÄÅÂêçÂºæÊ≠£, 1856.9.18-1837.5.22) was a pastor of the Nihon Kumiai Kirisuto Ky≈çkai (ÁµÑÂêàÊïô‰ºö, American Board/ the Congregation Church) and educator at Doshisha University. Ebina was born as a child of a samurai of the Yanagawa clan in Chikugo Province(now Fukuoka-ken, Yanagawa-shi), and from his early childhood, he was aware of his samurai status and the philosophy of loyalty to their monarchÔºàSekioka, 1983, 27). This philosophy was based on Confucian thought, but after the Meiji Restoration, the loss of the ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù who had been a God to Ebina, was very upsetting to him, and at first, he could not accept the new ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù the emperor. ÔºàSekioka, 1983, 29).<br> In 1872, Ebina entered Kumamoto Western School, where he studied astronomy and science education as well as Christianity by attending BibleClass held at the home of Leroy Lansing Janes. At first, Ebina had the impression that Confucianism and Christianity were at odds with each other in many respects, but after studying both religions in depth. He realized that the ‚Äúheaven(Â§©)‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod(Â§©Â∏ùÔºâ‚Äù taught by Confucianism were similar to the Christian God, and this opened the way for the acceptance of Christianity. Furthermore, by understanding Christianity as a continuation and extension of Bushido and Confucianism, God was accepted as a new ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù who would replace the feudal lord (Sekioka, 1983,34-36). He was baptized when he was a student of the Kumamoto western school(ÁÜäÊú¨Ê¥ãÂ≠¶Ê†°). Since Kumamoto Western School was closed in 1876, Ebina and his friends transferred to Doshisha English School, where Joseph Hardy Neesima greatly influenced them.<br> After graduating from Doshisha University in 1879, he served as a pastor in various churches, including Annaka(ÂÆâ‰∏≠), Maebashi(ÂâçÊ©ã), Kobe (Á•ûÊà∏), and Hongo(Êú¨ÈÉ∑). After graduating from school, Ebina worked in various areas before taking up his post in Kobe, where he was regarded as a heretic by the Orthodox. (Sekioka, 1983, 41) It was due to the influence of liberal theology(Ëá™Áî±Á•ûÂ≠¶) and new theology (Êñ∞Á•ûÂ≠¶) introduced to Japan in the late 1880s that both denied the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and understood Christianity rationally (Sekioka, 1983, 41-42). This new understanding of Christianity has had a profound influence on Ebina. Furthermore, during this period, there was the issue of the conflict between education and religion, and the relationship between Christianity, the state, and the ideology of conduct was being questioned (Sekioka, 1983, 42). It was his interpretation of the Trinity that led him to be considered a heretic by the most orthodox (Sekioka, 1983, 42). At the time, there were two positions, one denying Christ‚Äôs application based on Unitarian thought and the other emphasizing Christ‚Äôs application. Ebina argued that emphasizing only one side was prejudiced. Ebina was not a Unitarian because he believed, as did the Orthodox, that Christ was God and man and man and God, but he could not understand Christ as superhuman as the Son of God (Sekioka, 1983, 43). Furthermore, the next issue is that of redemption. At the root of Ebina‚Äôs view of mankind, there was no position that emphasized man as a being burdened with original sin and guilt. There was the idea that human beings are children of God, human beings with continuity to God, and it was extremely optimistic and sexist. This view was largely influenced by Confucianism and Shintoism‚Äôs view of mankind. Furthermore, although Ebina acknowledged the fact of his guilt from the beginning, he did not regard it as absolute, but only relative. (Sekioka, 1983, 44) He believed that sin was rebellion against God, but that the center of the cross was only a manifestation of God‚Äôs love. He further believed that the Christian God has two aspects, one of a transcendent God and one of an omnipresent God (immanent God), and must have these two aspects (Sekioka, 1983, 45).<br> In 1886, Ebina founded Hongo Church. Through Ebina‚Äôs efforts, this church increased its worship attendance and became the most crowded Congregationalist church in Tokyo (Iwai, 1973, 143).Furthermore, Ebina succeeded in spreading his thoughts through the media by publishing the magazine ‚ÄúShinjin („ÄéÊñ∞‰∫∫„Äè)‚Äù in 1900. This magazine, including Yoshino Sakuzo, who attended the Hongo Kyokai and others, attracted attention not only from the Christian church but also from the thought in Japan, supporting the peak period of the Hongo Church from 1904 to 1907 (Iwai, 1973, 146).
</p>
<p>
Ebina is thought to have accepted Christianity from the perspective of continuity and harmony with traditional Japanese thought, in addition to the ethical and mystical (religious) aspects of Christianity(Sekioka, 1983, 46-47). It is thought that he understood the ethical aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Confucianism and the mystical (religious) aspect of Christianity as being in continuity and harmony with Shintoism (Sekioka, 1983, 47). He had a nationalistic character, and his Christianity was called ‚ÄúShintoism Christianity.‚Äù Therefore, he actively supported the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and promoted the annexation of Korea, which he believed was the mission of Protestant Christianity in Japan. Thus, his understanding of Christianity was an assertion of ‚Äúimperial Christianity (Unoda, 287). Many young people accepted his ideas through several media, and his influence on young people was more impactful when he became president of Doshisha University in 1920.<br> Ebina was the president of Doshisha University from 1920 to 1928. Because of the turmoil at Doshisha for several years prior, it was felt that someone in leadership should assume the position (Sunakawa, 1965,98). Ebina believed that education is character education, and his educational philosophy was education through democracy that emphasizes freedom and autonomy, education through internationalism based on patriotism(ÊÑõÂõΩÂøÉ), and coeducation based on equality between men and women. (Dohi, 1965, 134) Ebina‚Äôs educational philosophy was based on Christian ideology and was also in line with the social climate of the time(Taisho democracy). It is also interesting to note that including military training in Christian education was not a contradiction for Ebina, and he actively incorporated it (Dohi, 1965, 135). Ebina actively provided opportunities for students to share Christianity within the school. In January 1923, he invited Michitomo Kanamori(ÈáëÊ£ÆÈÄöÂÄ´), who had become an ardent evangelist and obtained many baptismal candidates in school. In November 1927, he invited Teiichi Hori (Â†ÄË≤û‰∏Ä) as the chief of religion and attempted fervent evangelism in school (Dohi, 1965, 137). Besides enriching the Christian mission, Ebina‚Äôs accomplishments at Doshisha are the enhancement of the Faculty of Law and realizing coeducation. About the enhancement of the faculty of law, people inspired by Ebina‚Äôs liberal Christianity flocked to Doshisha and made significant contributions to Christian activities and scholarship within the university (Dohi, 1965, 138). Furthermore, several female students who had graduated from the English Literature Department of Doshisha Women‚Äôs College(vocational school ) were admitted to Doshisha University in April 1923. Such a system was not available at any other university at the time, and Ebina‚Äôs efforts can be seen (Dohi, 1965, 139-140)

Nakada Juji (‰∏≠Áî∞ÈáçÊ≤ª, 1870.10.27Ôºç1939.9.24Ôºâwas a founder and the first bishop of the Holiness Church of Japan. Nakada was born and raised in Hirosaki and entered the local Toogijuku schoolÔºàÊù±Â••Áæ©Â°æÔºâ. In 1888, Nakada was baptized in the Methodist Episcopal in Hirosaki(ÂºòÂâçÁæé‰ª•Êïô‰ºöÔºâ. He then entered Tokyo Eiwa School(Êù±‰∫¨Ëã±ÂíåÂ≠¶Ê†°, ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆÈùíÂ±±Â≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶), which produced many Methodist pastors. However, he failed to graduate and was engaged in missionary work in Hokkaido under Yoitsu Honda‚Äôs arrangement. Honda was a president of Toogijuku school when Nakada was studying at the school and was a significant influence on him, including during his time in Tokyo(Nakamura, 25). Few years later, Nakada enrolled in Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, in 1897. He had a sanctification experience there and tried to build a similar institute and train Japanese pastors for Japan.<br> After returning to Japan, Nakada organized the Holiness Union(<mark>ËÅñÊΩî‰πãÂèã)</mark> Union with several denomination members. It was the beginning of the Holiness Church in Japan. From 1901, Nakada started to do mission work with Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Charles Cowman in 1901, who met at Moody Bible School. In addition, they established a Bible school for the training of evangelists. In 1905, Nakada and Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Cowman founded the Oriental Missionary Society(<mark>Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö, OMS) to do mission work nationwide in Japan. This society emphasized the four gospels of the ‚Äúborn again (Êñ∞Áîü),‚Äù ‚Äúsanctification (ËÅñÂåñ),‚Äù ‚Äúthe second coming of the Lord (ÂÜçËá®),‚Äù and ‚Äúdivine healing(Á•ûÁôí)‚Äù. (Nakamura, 57)<br> In 1917 the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission (Êù±Ê¥ãÂÆ£Êïô‰ºö„Éõ„Éº„É™„Éç„ÇπÊïô‰ºö) was established as independent of OMS. As director, Nakada was in charge of activities in Japan, and Cowman and other missionaries concentrated on missions in Korea and China. The headquarters of the Oriental Mission was moved from Tokyo to Gyeongseong (now in Seoul) in 1921, and later, with the death of</mark> Cowman<mark>, the base of activities was moved to Shanghai (Nakamura, 65-66). After 1917, Holiness activities in Japan were centered on the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission. The OMS was developed as an ecumenical organization, but as its organization grew, differences with other denominations began to stand out. Hence, Nakada and his colleagues organized a new organization, the Holiness Church of the Oriental Mission(Nakamura, 68). The OMS actively expanded its evangelistic document distribution campaign from 1912 to 1918, distributing pamphlets and New Testaments throughout Japan. These activities increased the scope of the OMS and led to the subsequent Second Coming movement (Nakamura, 69-70).<br> In 1918, Nakada collaborated with Kanzo Uchimura and others in the Second Coming movement for about a year and a half. It was an impact of the outbreak of World War I. People saw the collapse of Western civilization in the wake of this war, and the Second Coming faith was advocated as a way to break the deadlock between liberalism and Christianity (Nakamura, 71). In March 1918, the ‚ÄúChristian Hope Society of Japan(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ∏åÊúõÂõ£) ‚Äô‚Äô was formed in Osaka by Methodists, Anglicans, Congligation churches, and Holiness and Baptists. This organization promoted the Second Coming Movement, which took place in various parts of the area and greatly influenced the Christian churches in Japan (Nakamura, 74). At this time, Nakada was intensely interested in Jewish issues; in 1919. He argued that it was the duty of Christians to pray for the salvation of the Jewish people, thereby hastening the Second coming of Christ (Nakamura, 75) The Second Coming movement ended in the first half of 1919, but revivals centering on the Holiness Church began in various places in the latter half of this year. In March 1920, a national revival conference was held in Japan, which was an ecumenical conference with over 700 participants from various denominations, including the Free Methodist Church of Japan and the Japan Cooperative Christian Church(now Alliance World Fellowship) (Nakamura, 81). As a result of this revival, the Holiness Church gained many baptized believers, which became the foundation for the significant expansion of the Holiness Church in the late 1920s (Nakamura, 82-83).<br> The growth of pure evangelicalism(Á¥îÁ¶èÈü≥Ê¥æ), including Holiness, from 1912 to 1925 was a notable point in the history of Japanese Protestantism. While the Japanese churches of the Taisho period became more organized and their faith more fixed on the academic and intellectual, the pure evangelicals spoke directly from the words of the Bible and emphasized the experience of the Holy Spirit (Nakamura, 84). These characteristics became an appealing point of Christianity to ordinary people (Nakamura , 84). Notably, the early congregations of Holiness brought the faith to the ordinary people, including lower-middle-class urban merchants, servants, and rural miners (Nakamura, 85). Furthermore, the active participation in evangelism by the teaching staff and the congregations themselves, and Nakada‚Äôs actions and leadership as a preacher were factors in the growth of Holiness (Nakamura, 86-87). Furthermore, they also focused on overseas evangelism. Although the Korean mission by the OMS had begun at the end of the Meiji era, a mission by the Holiness Church began in Fushun, Manchuria, in 1917. Although this was evangelism to the Japanese, Nakada believed evangelism in the colonies was a milestone that would lead to evangelism to foreigners. He subsequently promoted evangelism in Manchuria and Korea, expanding it to Taiwan and Sakhalin (Nakamura, 97). Nakada was optimistic about colonizing other countries, and in particular, the Taiwan mission that began in 1926 expanded rapidly, with as many as 14 churches established in the 1930s, evangelizing Taiwanese, Ami people, and other ethnic groups(Nakamura, 97). In addition, while evangelizing overseas, the company also actively accepted foreign students, educated them at Tokyo Bible Seminary, a Holiness Seminary, and sent them out to evangelize each ethnic group (Nakamura, 97). Among them were young people from the ethnic groups of Taiwan, Palau Island, Russia, Brazil, and the Ainu. Nakada considered the presence of young people from each region as a touchstone for missionary work, based on their assimilation into the Japanese people. Nakada‚Äôs nationalistic ideology greatly influenced the overseas mission of the Holiness Church. In this regard, the influence of his mentor, Honda Yoitsu, has been pointed out (Nakamura, 99). Thus, the Holiness Church greatly developed domestically and internationally through the Second Coming movement and revivals in the Taisho era.</mark> From an initial membership of 1,600 and forty -six churches, it grew rapidly to a membership of 19,523 in 1932(Mullins, 105). <mark>However, Nakada‚Äôs leadership greatly influenced the background of this development.<br> After 1933, Nakada argued more for the Second Coming, insisting that he should pray solely for Christ‚Äôs return and the Jewish people rather than for church formation or personal evangelism. (Nakamura, 122). Inspired by this statement, some people stopped their regular jobs to prepare for the Second Coming (Nakamura, 124). In response to Nakada‚Äôs claims, the Tokyo Bible Seminary faculty demanded his dismissal from his supervisory position, and Nakada filed a civil suit demanding the dismissal of five faculty members. The general press covered the conflict between the two parties, greatly tarnishing Christianity‚Äôs image (Nakamura, 126). The two groups reconciled in 1936, but Nakada‚Äôs group split into‚ÄùKiyome Church („Åç„Çà„ÇÅÊïô‰ºöÔºâ‚Äô‚Äô and the faculties‚Äô group into ‚ÄúNippon Seikyokai (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊïô‰ºö).‚Äù By 1940, there were 16,350 members of Nippon Seikyokai and 7,361 members of Kiyoke Church, including the Free Christian Church of Japan, indicating a significant difference in the number of members between the two groups. The separation of the Holiness Church was due to Nakada‚Äôs insistence on absolute authority as overseer, his emphasis on the Second Coming, and his theory of Japanese-Jewish common ancestry(Êó•„É¶ÈÅìÁ•ñË´ñ) syncretism linked to patriotism against the faculties of the Bible Seminary who were trying to preserve the tradition of the Holiness Church centered on the fourfold gospel (Nakamura, 128). Nakada‚Äôs speech and actions denied the previous way of evangelism and church formation of the Holiness Church, and when they went out of control, the Holiness Church was split (Nakamura, 129).</mark>

<p>
Toyohiko Kagawa (Ë≥ÄÂ∑ùË±äÂΩ¶, 1888.7.10„Éº1960.4.23) was a Christian evangelist and social activist who greatly influenced the post-World War I social movement. Born in Kobe in 1888, Kagawa was separated from his parents at an early age and spent his childhood suffering from the bankruptcy of the family that took him in, as well as his tuberculosis (Yasuda, 2004, 89). In 1904, he was baptized by Harry White Meyers(1874-1945) of the American Southern Presbyterian Mission at Tokushima Church of the Japan Christian Church. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin School in Tokyo, he entered Kobe Theological Seminary, newly established by the American Southern Presbyterian Mission in 1907. After 1909, Kagawa lived in a slum in Shinkawa, Kobe, where he engaged in evangelism and neighborhood projects. Around 1910, when Kagawa began to live in Shinkawa, there was a huge slum with a population of 70,000 miscellaneous people (Yasuda, 2004,89).„ÄÄKagawa started evangelizing in the slum to consider and resolve why this world created by God was full of evil, suffering, and cruelty and the meaning of it. Kagawa often suffered from illnesses caused by tuberculosis and from being relocated for medical treatment, and he asked himself the question, ‚ÄúIs life worth living? During this time, Kagawa discovered the meaning of God‚Äôs creation of humankind and decided to live in a slum to work for God (Dohi, 2011, 171-172). He faced firsthand the misery of poverty (Yasuda, 2004,90).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Kagawa studied psychology and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States in 1914. During this study abroad, he saw the workers‚Äô movement in the slums of New York City, which he witnessed profoundly impacting Kagawa (Namimatsu, 2014, 109). The American labor movement, where workers took the initiative, was a great learning experience for Kagawa and significantly influenced the following labor movement. In 1917, Kagawa returned to Japan, resumed evangelism in Shinkawa, and became more deeply involved in the labor union movement.
</p>
<p>
Kagawa believed that ‚Äúit is impossible to eliminate the ‚Äòpoor class‚Äô through philanthropism‚Äù and that the ‚Äúthoroughness of the idea of salvation‚Äù could only be achieved through ‚Äúthe sound development of labor unions‚Äù (Yasuda, 2004,91). In April 1919, he became the director of the Kansai Alliance of the Friendly Society (Y≈´aikai, ÂèãÊÑõ‰ºö), a mutual aid organization for workers. He also played a leading role in the consumer union movement and the farmers‚Äô union movement.
</p>
<p>
As for Christianity, he received the laying on of hands at Namba Church in April 1919 and was appointed as the pastor of Shinkawa Mission Church, which was established and authorized by the Mission Headquarters of the Society of Jesus and the Chukai, which he started when he entered the slum. Although Kagawa belonged to the Japan Christian Church, the Kobe Theological Seminary from which he graduated was a subsidiary of the Japan Christian Church and was run by the Southern Presbyterian Mission of the United States, which promoted its own mission within the Japan Christian Church, so Kagawa was not in a central position in the Japan Christian Church. Furthermore, the people of the Japanese Christian Church emphasized evangelism and church formation and did not hold Kagawa‚Äôs social movements in high regard (Dohi, 2011, 176-177).
</p>
<p>
In 1922, he formed the Japan Farmers‚Äô Union(Êó•Êú¨Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÁµÑÂêà), and he was instrumental in founding and fostering consumers‚Äô co-operative(ÁîüÊ¥ªÂçîÂêåÁµÑÂêà), becoming one of the founders of the co-op movement in Japan. For Kagawa, labor unions were considered a step toward universal human emancipation (Yasuda, 2004, 92). Thus, as a social activist and Christian evangelist, Kagawa engaged in social movements to practice his conviction of redemptive love. Furthermore, his semi-autobiographical <em>Before the Dawn</em> (‚ÄúShisen Wo Koete, Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶‚Äù), published in 1920, became a bestseller and made his name famous outside of Christian circles; a paid lecture held at Fujimi-cho Church in 1921 was attended by over 800 people (Dohi, 2011, 177).
</p>
<p>
In October 1921, at a meeting of the Japan Christian Church held in Nara Prefecture, Kagawa proposed the formation of a new ‚ÄúSociety of Friends of Jesus(Iesu no tomokai, „Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„ÅÆÂèã‰ºöÔºâ. He believed Christian churches needed to unite and develop a new religious movement to bring light to society amid the social and economic unrest after World War I. The five main pillars of the practice of this association were as follows, and these were the image of life that Kagawa sought for his comrades (Dohi, 2011, 177)

<p></p>
<p>
Formed by 14 pastors, the association became a group of students, farmers, and workers who sympathized with Kagawa‚Äôs ideas and movement and became a religious organization that transcended the boundaries of the Christian Church in Japan. This association‚Äôs strong unity became a powerful organization that supported Kagawa‚Äôs activities in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178).
</p>
<p>
In July 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Friends of Jesus, Kagawa appealed to follow the path taken by Jesus to rebuild Japan. It was carried out as the Kingdom of God Movement (Kamino kuni undo, Á•û„ÅÆÂõΩÈÅãÂãï) and the Million Salvation Movement (Hyakumannin kyurei undo, Áôæ‰∏á‰∫∫ÊïëÈúäÈÅãÂãï), greatly impacting Christianity in Japan and abroad (Dohi, 2011, 178). This event was later carried out as a nationwide cooperative evangelism(ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Kagawa played a central role in this movement, and his evangelistic meetings were attended by many people, resulting in a large number of seekers and baptismal candidates. This was a milestone in developing the Kingdom of God Movement throughout Japan. In April 1929, at a special meeting of the NCCC held with IMC President J.R. Mott, Kagawa again proposed a Kingdom of God Movement. With the League‚Äôs endorsement, it was decided that the Kingdom of God Movement would be developed by a central committee that included Kagawa (Dohi, 2011, 178-179).„ÄÄ
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kagawa was a Christian evangelist and a social activist. For Kagawa, the two were inseparable, and it is thought that he engaged in social activism as a Christian practice. Kagawa‚Äôs unique practice was carried out through his childhood experiences and study in the United States. On the other hand, these activities were not highly valued by the Japanese Christian Church to which he belonged, and Kagawa was more active in the NCCC than in the Japanese Christian Church. Because Kagawa was engaged in various social movements and deeply understood the situation in Japan, he gained many followers beyond the boundaries of the Christian Society and developed the Kingdom of God Movement.

The National Christian Church Council is a federation of Christian organizations in Japan, founded in November 1923 by several groups of Japanese Protestant denominations, foreign missions, and organizations. The Japan Continuing Committee, formed after the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, contacted the Federation of Christian Mission in Japa(Êó•Êú¨„Éü„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÂêåÁõü) and the Japanese Christian Association(Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£Êïô‰ºöÂêåÁõü) and discussed the establishment of the NCCC in May 1922. After the discussion, they established a Christian organization, the NCCC, in 1923 (Dohi, 2006, 20). The establishment of the NCCC was part of the National Christian Council (NCC) movement, an organization with a solid international flavor and close ties with ecumenical organizations overseas (Dohi, 2006, 207). The NCCC was established as a federation of Christian organizations in Japan for mutual exchange, cooperation, and joint projects. In addition, they aimed to work together to address common Christian problems and to interact with Christian organizations overseas (Dohi, 1980. 241-242).
</p>
<p>
In September 1926, 13 denominations, 8 organizations, and 22 missions had joined the NCCC. The Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan(Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÂÖ¨‰ºöÔºâ, which had decided that it was possible to cooperate with other denominations without denying its own traditions, joined in November 1929.(Dohi, 1980, 242).

<p>
The number of members of the NCCCJ was 100, of which 85 were 51 Japanese and 34 foreign missionaries. Although the Japanese accounted for more than half of the members, it is evident that many missionaries participated. The breakdown was as follows: 15 from the Christian Church of Japan, 12 from the Methodist Church, 12 from the Anglican Church, 10 from the Congregation Church, 6 from the Baptist, and the remaining 15 were elected by the 85 members of the council. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43) This headcount percentage is likely post-1929 since it includes the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p>
The first 20 regular council members were Kogo Uzaki (Methodist), Kameharu Ishizaka (Methodist), Samuel H Wainright (Methodist), Yoshimichi Hirata (Union Church), Hiromichi Ozaki (Union Church), Makoto Kobayashi, August Karl Reischauer (Presbyterian Missionaries of America), Daikichiro Tagawa ( (Japan Christian Church), Yugoro Chiba (Baptist), William Axling (Baptist), A.P. McKenzi (Canadian Methodist), Matanosuke Tayama, Kakujiro Ishikawa (Christian Church, Disciples)), Soichi Saito (YMCA Director), J.E. Nipp (Japan Christian Brotherhood Church), Charles Elmer Cowman (OMS), Shoichi Imamura, Ochimi Kubu Shira (Christian Women‚Äôs Association), Kikuta Matsuno (Holiness), and Castayota Inanuma (Japan Mipu Church, Methodist) were appointed. Ebisawa (Union Church) was appointed secretary. (Kirisuto Shinbunsha, 1960, 43)
</p>
<p>
The majority of Protestant denominations, groups, and mission organizations, except for evangelicals, were members of the Federation, and normally, the NCCC came to be thought of as the representative organization or contact point for the Protestant denomination in Japan (Dohi, 2006, 207). However, the federation did not have the function of dealing with church beliefs or politics, and its resolutions were not mandatory. Therefore, the NCCC was able to firmly oppose the Religious Organizations law of 1927 because the various denominations support it. However, the Religious Organizations Law of 1929 caused a conflict between the Methodist Church, which was negative about the bill, and the Japanese Christian Church, which was positive about it, and each groups to consider withdraw from the NCCC, so the NCCC could only take steps to step aside from the opposition movement. Therefore, the NCCC was not that powerful at that timeÔºàDohi, 2006„ÄÅ207-208).

<mark>One of the most active Christian organizations in the 1920s was the group of non-church movements. Kanzo Uchimura initiated it, and it is Japan‚Äôs own Christianity and one of the most famous Japanese Christianity (Mullins,2005, 77). Uchimura started his evangelism in 1900 when he launched the magazine ‚ÄúStudy of the Bible(ËÅñÊõ∏‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂).‚Äù Although Uchimura emphasized a direct connection with God, he was critical of the Japanese churches for their economic and spiritual dependence on Western missionary organizations. He also criticized the existing church system as hindering the independence of believers and came to believe that it was possible to live as a Christian outside the church. Uchimura named such a position ‚ÄúNon-Church movements (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºöÈÅãÂãï)‚Äù (Akae, 2013, 11). In 1901, he published the magazine ‚ÄúNon-Church (ÁÑ°Êïô‰ºö)‚Äù and used the term ‚ÄúNon-Church‚Äù as ‚Äúthe church of the churchless. The background for the establishment of Non-Church was the experience of an independent church (Áã¨Á´ãÊïô‰ºö) in Sapporo, where he realized that it is possible to conduct a life of faith without relying on the church system or clergy. Uchimura‚Äôs strong evangelical faith was also based on his interaction with Quakers while studying in the U.S. and his religious experience at Amherst College (Mullins, 2005, 79-81).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Although the non-church and the non-church movement took various organizational forms, it mainly revolved around Uchimura‚Äôs Bible lectures, or ‚Äúmeetings or study groups,‚Äù and publishing a ‚Äúmagazine.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs direct disciples paid fees to attend the study groups. At the same time, Uchimura‚Äôs activities through magazines and other publications were so active that they were also called ‚Äúchurches on paper,(Á¥ô‰∏ä„ÅÆÊïô‰ºö)‚Äù the number of subscribers gradually increased (AKae,2013, 14). Uchimura‚Äôs writings on nondenominationalism were accepted by many people both inside and outside the church, and among those considered Uchimura‚Äôs disciples were Toraji Tsukamoto (Â°öÊú¨Ëôé‰∫å), Tadao Yanaihara(Áü¢ÂÜÖÂéüÂø†ÈõÑ), Kokichi Kurosaki (ÈªíÂ¥éÂπ∏Âêâ), Shigeru Nanbara (ÂçóÂéüÁπÅ), and others who would go on to write many works in higher education and Christianity (Mullins, 77). In 1905, Uchimura organized a Kyoyu-kai (ÊïôÂèã‰ºö) requiring 119 members (this group became a Kashiwagi Brotherhood (ÊüèÊú®ÂÖÑÂºüÂõ£) in 1916). Membership was limited to individuals who had faithfully served a Christian life for at least one year (Mullins,2005, 88-89)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Uchimura‚Äôs disciples independently developed activities through meetings and magazines even before he died in 1930. (Akae, 2013, 14) The development of Non-Church movements coincided with the expansion of the publishing media in Japanese society. In 1937, at least 29 magazines were published by non-church members, and these magazines varied in circulation from a few dozen to several thousand, with readers subscribing to several magazines and attending lectures (Akae, 2013, 14-15). In the postwar 1950s, the number of unchurched Christians was estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 or even 100,000. Akae points out that this number is too large, as those counted ‚Äúreaders‚Äù as members of their congregations (Akae, 2013, 15). The bearers of Non-Church movements are basically the ‚Äúreaders‚Äù of the magazines. Within them, there were two types of culturalism/ liberalism: one was the academic elite (students and intellectuals) who were established based on Ichi High School and Tokyo Imperial University, and the other was the middle-class culturalism/ liberalism people who were farmers and merchants, but who sought to read the Bible lectures through books and magazines (Akae, 2013, 21).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Thus, the Non-Church movement grew while criticizing the existing church system and increased its followers through subscriptions to ‚Äúmagazines.‚Äù Uchimura‚Äôs strong personality attracted readers and resonated with the Non-Church Movements. Furthermore, the development of the publishing culture contributed greatly to the expansion of Non-Church Movements, allowing a diverse range of people throughout Japan to learn about the ideas of Non-Church Moments.</mark>

<p>
During this period, Christianity developed a certain growth and activity without being severely tested (Dohi, 1980, 228).
</p>
<p>
The first is the Taisei Movement (Â§ßÊàêÈÅãÂãï) of the Methodist Church in Japan. This movement was a response to the Centennial Movement conducted by the Mission bords of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. to commemorate the centennial of its establishment. In Japan, the movement was implemented over four years beginning in March 1919, with one congregation leading one new person (‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏ÄÈúä), one Bible verse read each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÁØÄ), and a small amount of donation each day (‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÈáë). To do this movement, they aim to Christian indoctrination throughout the Methodist Church in Japan (Dohi,1980, 238). During this four-year campaign, the total number of members increased by 7,700, and the number of baptized persons increased by more than 11,000, a 50% increase. In addition, educational facilities and a church building were also constructed with funds raised through this campaign and donations from the three Methodist missions. On the other hand, the huge donations from the three missions indicate the difficulty of independence from the missions the Japanese church aimed for at that time. (Dohi,1980, 238-239)
</p>
<p>
Next, the National Christian Church Council (Êó•Êú¨Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÈÄ£Áõü, NCCC), formed in 1923, conducted the National Christianization Movement. From October 1924 to June 1925, the National Christianization Movement involved about 800 lectures, sermons, and pilgrimage evangelism in some 200 cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan, with about 100,000 people participating (Dohi, 1980, 242). One interesting point of this movement is that government officials supported it. For example, some local governments provide places, and their officials attend the meetings (Dohi, 1980,242). It was due to the government‚Äôs efforts to use religious power to promote goodwill or a good way of thinking in response to the social unrest following the Great Kanto Earthquake of</p></li>

<ol start="1923" type="1">
<li>In February 1924, a meeting of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian representatives was also held in this connection. The cooperation of local government offices with the Christian churches was a concrete manifestation. It also promoted Inciting National Spirit (ÂõΩÊ∞ëÁ≤æÁ•û‰ΩúËàà) and the goodwill of thought (ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÂñÑÈÅì)(Dohi, 1980,242). On the other hand, the NCCC‚Äôs attitude of cooperation with the government was also the same attitude of the Christian Society in the mobilized society that followed. On April 12, 1929, at the National Christian Council (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂçîË≠∞‰ºö) organized by the NCCC, they decided to start a campaign the Nationwide Evangelical Movements (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂçîÂêå‰ºùÈÅì). Furthermore, at the National Christian Council organized by the NCCC in April 1929, Toyohiko Kagawa proposed the implementation of the ‚ÄúKingdom of God Movement. Then, the Kingdom of God Movement began nationwide in 1930.

This period also saw the active involvement of Catholic and Protestant groups in leprosy. Christian churches had already begun to work for leprosy during the Meiji period, and Christian participation also increased during this period (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115). (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115) Public hospitals were established in various areas, and patients were actually admitted during this period. Christian doctors and nurses worked at these facilities. Some tried to promote Christian evangelism among the people there (Sugiyama, Kindle, 115-116). For example, Fumio Hayashi (ÊûóÊñáÈõÑ, 1900-1947) was a physician who wanted to become a leprosy doctor to solve the problem of medicine and faith (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). Also, Christian missionaries began to work at the sanatoriums, and some Christians thought evangelizing in sanatoriums was their mission. The sanatoriums also welcomed Christian missionaries to exhort there to keep the public morale in the sanatoriums (Sugiyama, Kindle, 116). In 1925, the Japan MTL (Mission to Lepers), a leprosy relief organization led by Toyohiko Kagawa, was formed to support sanatoriums and promote segregation, following comfort visits and missionary activities for the inmates. (Sugiyama, Kindle, 111)
</p>
<p>
During this period, Christianity found its raison d‚Äôetre in social works. They tried to resolve social issues such as relief for orphans and disabled children and support for delinquent children. Because of this work, it led to a great development of social programs by Christian organizations. Furthermore, working with lepers was perceived by Christians as an act of ‚Äúlove,‚Äù and they sought to work with the most oppressed people in the world to demonstrate ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs love. However, it should not forgotten that evangelism in sanatoriums also helped to keep public morale and supported the segregation policy (Sugiyama, Kindle, 118).

<mark>In the 1920s, various religions, including Christianity, were featured in magazines. For example, general magazines ran features on religion, such as ‚ÄúLife and Religion Issue‚Äù (Shin Shosetsu Êñ∞Â∞èË™¨, March issue) and ‚ÄúReligion Issue‚Äù (Shufu no Tomo ‰∏ªÂ©¶„ÅÆÂèã, March issue). In addition, books on religion were published, including ‚ÄúPenitential Life, Êá∫ÊÇî„ÅÆÁîüÊ¥ª‚Äù (1921) by Nishida Tenka(Ë•øÁî∞Â§©È¶ô), the founder of Ittoen(‰∏ÄÁÅØÂúí) and ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê)‚Äù by Kurata Hyakuzo(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â), who wrote about Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect of Buddhism. ‚ÄúThe ordained and their disciples‚Äù was one of the most popular works of the 1920s and led to the ‚ÄúShinran boom‚Äù that followed. Among the best-selling religious books of the period was Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs Before the Dawn (Shisen wo Koete Ê≠ªÊà¶„ÇíË∂ä„Åà„Å¶ ‚Äù (1920) (Suzuki, 231 ).</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>The reason for the sales of books related to religion was the expansion of media culture, such as newspapers and magazines, and the influence of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Especially the young generation was interested in religion because, in the wake of the war, the revolution, and the crisis of modernity and modern civilization, they sought a religion that worked more deeply into their psyches and lives rather than the existing religions (Suzuki, 231-232). Therefore, people were looking for religion broadly, and the media industry responded in kind.„ÄÄ</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>Among these, ‚ÄúBefore the Dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPillars of the Clouds (Kumo no Hashira Èõ≤„ÅÆÊü±),‚Äù published in 1922, became bestsellers. As for other Bible translations and religious books, ‚ÄúThe Gospel and Christianity‚Äù by Tokutaro Takakura(È´òÂÄâÂæ≥Â§™ÈÉé) was published in October 1927. In November of this year, Setsuji Otsuka(Â§ßÂ°öÁØÄÊ≤ª) introduced a study of Swiss theologian Emil Brunner(1889-1966). In 1922, ‚ÄúRevival Chant‚Äù was published by Shigeharu Nakata‚Äôs second son, Ugo(‰∏≠Áî∞ÁæΩÂæå). This chant was sung not only in various congregations of the Holiness Church but also widely among pure evangelicals as the revival progressed. It was re-edited and taken over after the war. (Nakamura, 83)</mark>
</p>
<p>
<mark>As for Catholics, from the 1920s to the 1930s, some people appeared to teach Catholic theology, philosophy, and social thought to Japanese society through their writing activities. It was due to the gradual coIn particular, Iwashita Soichi(Â≤©‰∏ãÂ£Æ‰∏Ä), Yoshimitsu Yoshi hiko(ÂêâÊ∫ÄÁæ©ÂΩ¶), Tozuka Bunkei (Êà∏Â°öÊñáÂçø), and Kotaro Tanaka(Kotaro Tanaka) formed a group of Catholic thinkers (Miyoshi, 98). After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Iwashita studied in Europe and worked as a Catholic priest for leprosy patients. Totsuka also became a priest after studying in Paris, established a tuberculosis sanatorium and other facilities, and served as the lead writer of the monthly magazine ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatholic Newspaper. Tanaka also graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served as Minister of Education after the war (Miyoshi, 98-99). Iwashita baptized both Totsuka and Tanaka.nsolidation of Catholic higher education institutions in Japanese culture. Therefore, Iwashita was the central figure of the Catholic Thought Society at that time.</mark>

<strong>Âá∫Âè£Áéã‰ªÅ‰∏âÈÉéÔºà1871.8.27-1948.1.19)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Deguchi Oninzaburo was a second-generation leader of the Oomoto-kyo from the 1920s onward. He became a member of the My≈çrei Church(Â¶ôÈúäÊïô‰ºö, a kind of mountain worship) after mystical experiences with his family and himself (Kawamura, 2017, 138-139). After various occupations, he decided to become a religious practitioner and studied the spiritual arts, and in 1898, he met Nao Deguchi and joined the Omoto-kyo. With his experience as a religious practitioner, Onisaburo established the organizational structure of the Omoto-Kyo and founded the Kinmei Reigakkai(ÈáëÊòéÈúäÂ≠¶‰ºö), with Nao as the head minister and himself as president. This association was characterized by its national theocratic appearance, interspersed with discourses on the state based on an imperialist view of history (Kawamura, 2017, 160).
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄAfter gaining Nao‚Äôs trust, Ohninzaburo was chosen as the successor of the Daimonkyo in 1900, married Sumi, the fifth daughter of Nao Deguchi, and changed his name to Ohninzaburo. Meanwhile, internal conflicts erupted, and in 1908 the Konmei Reigakkai was renamed the Dai Nihon Shusaikai(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨‰øÆÊñé‰ºö), with Nao as president and chancellor and Ohninzaburo as chairman. One of the characteristics of Oninzaburo‚Äôs religious thought and practical movement was that he emphasized imperialism and Japanism by juxtaposing and joining Nao‚Äôs teachings to the Imperial Law and National Shinto (Kawamura, 2017, 197-198). With the outbreak of World War I, Oomoto also sought to gain adherents through written propaganda and the use of mass media (Kawamura, 2017, 198).
</p>
<p>
In 1916, Onisaburo revised the Oomoto-kyo as the Kodo-Oomoto( ÁöáÈÅìÂ§ßÊú¨, Imperial Way Omoto) and published the journal Shinreikai(„ÄéÁ•ûÈúäÁïå„Äè); when Nao died in November 1918, Onisaburo used his previous knowledge (Kokugaku, Shinto, Confucianism, spiritualism, etc.) to interpret Nao‚Äôs writing, formulating and publishing his writings. He interpreted it with a Kokutai discourse based on national Shinto and inclined toward Japanism and kokutai ideology (Kawamura, 2017,213). He then constructed Omoto and Kokutai discourse that surpassed the Emperor Myth and National Shinto by speaking of the so-called Kodo. (Kawamura, 2017,213)
</p>
<p>
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile, the Taisho Restoration Movement of Omoto-kyo developed nationwide, and fervent missionary efforts were carried out nationwide (Kawamura, 2017, 229). In 1920, a training hall was constructed, enabling more large-scale lectures and practices, and a new training facility was also built in Kameoka, Kyoto (Kawamura, 2017, (233). Street missions and public lectures increased the number of those interested in and practicing Oomoto-kyo. The number of local branches, mainly in Kansai, increased from 40 in 1917 to 80 in 1919, and in the 1920s, it expanded to Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taiwan, bringing the total to 148 (Kawamura, 2017,233). At the same time, accusations and attacks against Omoto-kyo were also prolific (Kawamura, 2017, 240). This rapid expansion resulted in government repression, and on February 12, 1921, several members, including Ohnisaburo, were arrested for disrespect and newspaper violations. And police desrpyed Deguchi Nao‚Äôs tomb. At the time, the Kodo-Oomoto was estimated to have a congregation of 10,000, a tremendous growth from the 1,000 members around 1912. Furthermore, contact with the Baha‚Äôi Faith brought internationalist overtones. The Baha‚Äôi Faith used Esperanto, which Wang Jinzaburo was eager to learn and which was also adopted by the Oomoto Church (Kawamura, 2017, 261). Furthermore, Onisaburo‚Äôs Asianism led to an alliance in 1923 with the Chinese Daoin (the five great religions) and even the World Red Manji Jikai, and later to an expedition to Manchuria 261)
</p>
<p>
The characteristics of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought were understood as a mixture of Japanism, Asianism, and internationalism booming in the 1920s. However, it is also important to note that at the root of Onisaburo‚Äôs thought was the coexistence of nationalistic Shinto thought. Imperial Japan was placed at the center of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (nationalistic) for China and Manchuria (Kawamura, 2017,274). It shows that in the 1920s, Onisaburo, although repressed, was still free to carry out the missionary work of the Oomoto religion. This organizational expansion led to another round of repression in 1935 when Ohnsaburo and his cadres were arrested on charges of disrespect and violation of the Security Law; after the second round of repression, the cult was dismantled when the government confiscated its land, but after the war, it was restarted as Aizen-en, which was later renamed the Aizen-en(ÊÑõÂñÑËãë) after the war.

There was no general opposition act to Christianity during the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, this period showed a growing interest in new religions and Buddhism. In particular, interest in Shinran(Ë¶™È∏û,1173-1263), the founder of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó), began to grow around 1922. It was also known as the ‚ÄúShinran boom(Ë¶™È∏û„Éñ„Éº„É†),‚Äù and the literary community led this phenomenon. During this period, many novels and plays were published on Shinran, with 16 major works with ‚ÄúShinran‚Äù in the title alone(Nakajima, 2017, 148). Works featuring Shinran include Gohei Ishimaru(Áü≥‰∏∏Ê¢ßÂπ≥,1886-1969)‚Äôs ‚ÄúNingen Shinran(„Äé‰∫∫ÈñìË¶™È∏û„Äè)‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassion of Shinran(„ÄéÂèóÈõ£„ÅÆË¶™È∏û„Äè),‚Äù both of which became famous. As a human being, Shinran was portrayed not as the founder of Jodo Shinshu or as an incarnation of God, but as a human being suffering from his own problems. (Nakajima, 2017,154) On the side of historiography, the mystical aspect was denied, and Shinran was explored as a historical fact. Some scholars began to study Shinran as a living person who did not perform miracles, and some even proposed the ‚Äútheory of Shinran‚Äôs elimination(Ë¶™È∏ûÊäπÊÆ∫Ë´ñ)‚Äù that he did not exist in history(Nakajima, 2017,155). These discussions led to the acceptance of Shinran as an ‚Äúordinary human being‚Äù who was neither an incarnation of God nor a miracle worker (Nakajima, 2017,156).
</p>
<p>
In 1917, Kurata Hyakuso(ÂÄâÁî∞Áôæ‰∏â, 1891-1943) published ‚ÄúPriest and his Disciples(Âá∫ÂÆ∂„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÂºüÂ≠ê),‚Äù and it was the beginning t of the Shinran boom that began in 1917. These works were written based on existing biographies and do not show Shinran as a mystic (incarnation of God, miracles, etc.). Furthermore, most works depict Shinran as a young man in his youth and a person in pain (Nakajima, 2017,157-158). The two types of Shinran depicted in this period are Shinran as a young man suffering from his afflictions and earnestly seeking salvation from them and Shinran as an older man who warmly watches over his disciples from the same perspective. In this period, the First World War had ended, and human suffering would never cease no matter how advanced civilization became. Shinran attracted attention as the embodiment of such human suffering (Nakajima, 2017,161-162). Even more noteworthy is the development of the publishing culture during this period. In this background, Shinran was mass-produced and consumed as a diverse ‚ÄúOwn Shinran‚Äù beyond the framework of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´(Nakajima, 2017,162). During this period, Hideichi Noyori(Èáé‰æùÁßÄÂ∏Ç,1885-1968) was a powerful link between the media and Shinran. He started the Dainippon Shinshu Propaganda Association(Â§ßÊó•Êú¨ÁúüÂÆóÂÆ£‰ºùÂçî‰ºö) in 1921. In September, he launched the magazine Shinshu no Sekai („ÄéÁúüÂÆó„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè) to convey his vision of Shinran to the general public(Nakajima, 2017,162). He tried to spread Shinran andJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´‚Äôs thoughts, criticized corruptJ≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests, spread Shinran‚Äôs message to people outside the Shinshu community, and increased his visibility Nakajima, 2017,(163-164).
</p>
<p>
The background to the depiction of Shinran as a human being and his wide acceptance by the public was also the climate of the Taisho period (1912-1926). In this time, people began to think about ‚Äúindividual liberation(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆËß£Êîæ)‚Äù and to seek ‚Äúindividual fulfillment(ÂÄã‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖÖÂÆü)‚Äù in Japan. Therefore, this was also why religious literature such as Toyohiko Kagawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the Battle to the Death‚Äù and Koyata Ehara‚Äôs (Ê±üÂéüÂ∞èÂº•Â§™, 1882-1978) ‚ÄúThe New Testament(„Äå„ÄéÊñ∞Ë®≥„Äè),‚Äù both based on humanism, was widely read (Nakajima, 2017,171). Thus, people‚Äôs interest in Buddhism and new religions expanded, including the Shinran boom.
