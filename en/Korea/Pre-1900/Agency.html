Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:
</p>

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.

‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.

Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.

Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.

Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù

Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).

<p>
In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886. It is doubtful to define these relationships were positive, neutral, or negative at that time. At least, Joseon dynasty was not prepared to open the nation‚Äôs door.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

: Manmingongdonghoe (People‚Äôs Joint Association, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) and Gwanmingondonghoe (Joint Conference of Government Officials and the People, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

1894 Pyongyang Persecution
</p>
<p>
An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.

Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
That both officials and people shall determine not to rely on any foreign aid but to do their best to strengthen and uphold the Imperial prerogatives.
</p>

<li>
<p>
That all documents pertaining to foreign loans, the hiring of foreign soldiers, to grant concessions, etc., in short, every document drawn up between the Korean government and a foreigner shall be signed and stamped by all the Ministers of State and the President of the Privy Council.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Those important offenders shall be punished only after they have been given a public trial and an ample opportunity to defend themselves.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That to His majesty shall belong the power of appointing his ministers but that in case the majority of the Cabinet disapproves a man, he shall not be appointed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That all sources of revenue and methods of raising taxes should be placed under the control of the Finance Department, no other department or officer or therewith, and that the annual estimates and balance shall be made public.

</li>
<li>
<p>
That the existing laws and regulations should be enforced without fear or favor.

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.

‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.

Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.
</p>
</li>

<p>
Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù

Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).

<p>
In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

: Overall, how restrictive were the regulations on religion or some aspects of religion and how suppressive of the state over religion? Was there a state religion de jure or de facto? Were there privileged religions during this decade? (500-1000 words)

Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886. It is doubtful to define these relationships were positive, neutral, or negative at that time. At least, Joseon dynasty was not prepared to open the nation‚Äôs door.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

1894 Pyongyang Persecution
</p>
<p>
An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.

Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.

Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).

<p>
In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

: Overall, how restrictive were the regulations on religion or some aspects of religion and how suppressive of the state over religion? Was there a state religion de jure or de facto? Were there privileged religions during this decade? (500-1000 words)

<p>
Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Was there any tension between nationalism/patriotism and Christianity in general?

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a <strong>nationalist ritual</strong> can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.

Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
That both officials and people shall determine not to rely on any foreign aid but to do their best to strengthen and uphold the Imperial prerogatives.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That all documents pertaining to foreign loans, the hiring of foreign soldiers, to grant concessions, etc., in short, every document drawn up between the Korean government and a foreigner shall be signed and stamped by all the Ministers of State and the President of the Privy Council.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Those important offenders shall be punished only after they have been given a public trial and an ample opportunity to defend themselves.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That to His majesty shall belong the power of appointing his ministers but that in case the majority of the Cabinet disapproves a man, he shall not be appointed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That all sources of revenue and methods of raising taxes should be placed under the control of the Finance Department, no other department or officer or therewith, and that the annual estimates and balance shall be made public.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That the existing laws and regulations should be enforced without fear or favor.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.

‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù

In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.

Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.

Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.

Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù

Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).

In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886. It is doubtful to define these relationships were positive, neutral, or negative at that time. At least, Joseon dynasty was not prepared to open the nation‚Äôs door.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

1894 Pyongyang Persecution
</p>
<p>
An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.

Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:
</p>

<li>
<p>
That both officials and people shall determine not to rely on any foreign aid but to do their best to strengthen and uphold the Imperial prerogatives.

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.

<p>
‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.

Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886. It is doubtful to define these relationships were positive, neutral, or negative at that time. At least, Joseon dynasty was not prepared to open the nation‚Äôs door.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

1894 Pyongyang Persecution
</p>
<p>
An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

<p>
Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.

Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:
</p>

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="I">

<p>
Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.
</p>
</li>
<li>

Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù

Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).

<p>
In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

: Manmingongdonghoe (People‚Äôs Joint Association, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) and Gwanmingondonghoe (Joint Conference of Government Officials and the People, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

1894 Pyongyang Persecution
</p>
<p>
An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.

Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
That both officials and people shall determine not to rely on any foreign aid but to do their best to strengthen and uphold the Imperial prerogatives.
</p>

<li>
<p>
That all documents pertaining to foreign loans, the hiring of foreign soldiers, to grant concessions, etc., in short, every document drawn up between the Korean government and a foreigner shall be signed and stamped by all the Ministers of State and the President of the Privy Council.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Those important offenders shall be punished only after they have been given a public trial and an ample opportunity to defend themselves.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That to His majesty shall belong the power of appointing his ministers but that in case the majority of the Cabinet disapproves a man, he shall not be appointed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That all sources of revenue and methods of raising taxes should be placed under the control of the Finance Department, no other department or officer or therewith, and that the annual estimates and balance shall be made public.

</li>
<li>
<p>
That the existing laws and regulations should be enforced without fear or favor.

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.

‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.

Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.
</p>
</li>

<p>
Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù

Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).

<p>
In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

: Overall, how restrictive were the regulations on religion or some aspects of religion and how suppressive of the state over religion? Was there a state religion de jure or de facto? Were there privileged religions during this decade? (500-1000 words)

Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886. It is doubtful to define these relationships were positive, neutral, or negative at that time. At least, Joseon dynasty was not prepared to open the nation‚Äôs door.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

1894 Pyongyang Persecution
</p>
<p>
An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.

Seo Sang-ryun‚Äôs life and evangelical work illustrates how mission initiatives were established by indigenous Koreans before the Western missionaries arrived at Korea. (1) <strong>Bible translations</strong>. Seo was born into a rich family and learned Chinese literature (<mark>Êº¢Â≠∏)</mark> in the schoolhouse (seodang, Êõ∏Â†Ç). This learning was used significantly to translate the Chinese version of the bible into Korean later. He lost his parents when he was 14 years old due to a waterborne infection and became a merchant to earn money with his younger brother. At this time, Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, <mark>ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ</mark> ), a regent of King Gojong maintained an isolation policy that contested ‚Äúno treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.‚Äù Western missionaries including John Ross was seeking for opportunities to reach Koreans in Manchuria. A ginseng merchant, Seo Sang-ryun, caught a serious typhoid fever and was treated by Western missionary in Manchuria. He experienced Christianity and received baptism by John Ross. Seo then partnered with Ross and McIntyre to translate the Bible. This group completed the Gospel of Luke (ÏòàÏàòÏÖ©ÍµêÎàÑÍ∞ÄÎ≥µÏùåÏ†ºÏÖî, see in the box), in 1882, the other three Gospels in 1884, and the entire New Testament in 1887. They used Hangul (Korean) as the main language for this translation. That is, this translation aimed to introduce the Bible to indigenous and underrepresented people like women, rather than an elite group (Yangban, ÂÖ©Áè≠) who learned Chinese classics. (2) <strong>Laborer for the gospel</strong> (Colporteur: Maeseoi Îß§ÏÑúÏù∏ Ë≥£Êõ∏‰∫∫ or Gwonseoin Í∂åÏÑúÏù∏ Âã∏Êõ∏‰∫∫). Preaching the gospel in Korea was rapidly spread by colporteurs who sold the Bible or books. The system of the colporteurs existed from Oct.&nbsp;6, to May 1972. This system was involved with the Bible Society of Korea, the Christian Literature Society of Korea, Gidoggymunsa Âü∫Áù£ÊïéÊñáÁ§æ and other organizations. They contributed significantly to the growth of the Church and the diffusion of Hangeul and the development of Korean culture. In 1882, Seo was sent to Seoul as the first Korean colporteur of the British Bible Society. He carried the gospel Euiju and Hwanghae-do on his way to Seoul and started his evangelical activities around Namdaemun Gate in Seoul, one of the biggest markets. His work successfully helped a number of people experience the gospel and he asked Ross to baptize those people in Seoul. However, Ross could not get into Korea due to the impacts of political situations between China and Korea. Underwood administered baptism for those 13 converts in 1885. (3) Founded the first Protestant Christian Church. In 1883, he was imprisoned due to his trial of bringing the Bible and Christian literature into Korea. With his relative‚Äôs help, he escaped to Songcheon in Hwanghaedo with his younger brother and preached the Gospel to his neighbors. His efforts formed a small group of converts that was developed into the first Protestant Christian Church in Korea. This church was established by indigenous Koreans without missionaries.

His conversion describes how Confucian scholars in the ruling class (Yangban, <mark>ÂÖ©Áè≠) adapted Christianity in the late Joseon Dynasty. He understood Christianity is the root of the Western power based innovative and advanced science and technologies and political systems. Adapting Christianity was the best way to save his country which was collapsing. He heard of the social development progress of Japan from his friend who was a diplomat and wanted to see and learn it. At the age of 40 in 1882, he was sent to Japan as a member of Park Yeonghyo‚Äôs envoy group and studied there. He converted to Christianity with the aid of Tsuda Shen, a Japanese Protestant and then was baptized by G. W. Knox at No-Wol-Jung Church in Tokyo in 1883. He devoted his life to bible translation and inviting missionaries to Joseon to implement Western education and public medical systems. <strong>(1) Bible translations</strong>. Lee Su Jung was born into a family of Confucian scholars in the Yangban class. He mainly learned Chinese classics but had knowledge about Roman Catholicism. On his way to Japan with Park Yonghyo, he brought the Evidence of Christianity by Martin, the Commentary on the Gospel of Mark, and the Nevius Catechism by Nevius (So, 1993). His uncle was a martyred Roman Catholic that had a considerable knowledge about Christianity. Thus, he had knowledge of both Confucianism and the Bible before he met Tsuda Shen. Lee was impressed by conversations with Tsuda Shen about Christianity and started studying the Bible. One day he had a dream about God‚Äôs vision of the Bible in Joseon that made him devote himself to the study of the Bible. When he returned to Japan without official obligations, Lee was requested to translate the Bible into Korean by Henry Loomis (1839-1920), the Japan agent of the American Bible Society (ABS). Lee then translated the five books of the Chinese New Testament -the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts-into Chinese with Korean language suffixes (added to aid the reading of Chinese texts), the <em>Hyun-To-Han-Han-Shin-Yak-Sung-Gyung</em> (Êá∏ÂêêÊº¢ÈüìÊñ∞Á¥ÑËÅñÊõ∏) in 1883. One thousand copies of each translation were published from 1883 to 1884 by the ABS (Loomis to Gilman, 21 June 1883). Lee completed the translation of the Gospel of Mark as a Chinese-Korean mixed version, of which 6,000 copies were published at Yokohama in 1885 by ABS. It is noteworthy that while the United Presbyterian Church Versions by Ross and McIntyre with Seo Sang-ryun were distributed under the auspice of the British Bible societies in northern Korean and among Koreans in Manchuria, the Su Jung Lee Versions were provided under the auspice of the ABS in the Southern Korea. Additionally, Lee‚Äôs version attracted the educated Koreans who learned Chinese literature. <strong>(2) Establishment of the first Korean church in Japan.</strong> Lee was teaching Korean at the Tokyo Foreign Language School to focus on translating the Bible even though Japanese governments offered a higher position. A number of Korean students were studying in secondary schools in Tokyo. Lee began to preach to these Korean students and the resident foreign missionaries came to teach the Bible. This service grew to the regular worship services and became the first Korean Protestant Church in Japan in 1884. Later, some of the baptized students went to the U.S. for further study and others became high officials in the government in Joseon and Daehanminguk. <strong>(3) Calling for Western missionaries to Joseon</strong>. Su Jung Lee requested Knox to send a missionary to Joseon but refuse Japanese churches‚Äô proposal about it because he had observed a series of political conflicts and incidents between Joseon and Japan. Additionally, he wanted to adapt the original Western missionaries and their missionary business. Knox and Loomis introduced the letter of Su Jung Lee (see in the Box) to the American churches in 1884 and the Foreign Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church of America decided to appoint the missionary to Joseon. Lee was considered as the first Korean Macedonian who opened a new chapter for the Korean Church by calling the American missionaries. For example, Hoarce Underwood who founded multiple educational institutes and churches in Joseon later was impressed by Lee‚Äôs letter. Underwood learned Korean language by Lee in Japan and brought Lee‚Äôs New Testaments into Joseon in 1885.</mark>

This is the first Korean modernist-nationalist organization and <em>the Independent</em> is its public intellectual forum. Whereas Seo Sang-ryun and Lee Su Jung translated the Bible in Korean and founded churches, Seo Jae-pil used Christianity as a philosophy to reform political, economic, and social structures in Joseon through educating ordinary people. His dream for this reform failed through the Gapshin Coup due to intervention by the Qing military and a lack of ordinary Joseon people‚Äôs support in 1884. He fled to the United States and his family was wiped out by King Gojong and conservative government officials. He converted to the Christian faith while learning English at the local YMCA. Seo attended high school and college with assistance by William Hollenback, a Christian philanthropist, and he became the first Korean to obtain U.S. citizenship and adapted his name, Philip Jaisohn in 1890. He gained a medical degree in 1892. 10 years after the failure of the Gapshin Coup that forced King Gojong to implement reforms, Seo with other plotters were invited to return to Joseon to help reform the Joseon government. Until he was expelled by the Joseon government again in 1898, his arguments were in two folds. First, the government must protect the life and property of any person. Second, everyone has the equality and rights of a person which was granted by God (Choi, 2020). <strong>(1) Enlightenment movement using Doknip sinmun (the Indipendent, Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû).</strong> When Jaisohn returned to Joseon in 1895, the King and his government were confronted with the height of political instability. After losing the war, the Qing dynasty ceded its power over the Korean peninsula to the conqueror, Japan. Russia attempted to take the power which the Qing dynasty lost. King Gojong lost his control and visions for his government and people suffered under the tyranny of officials. Jaisohn created Doknip sinmun (1896, The Independent) and published various messages to enlighten people against the incumbent government. Doknip simun published in both Korean (Hangul) and English three times a week. Isabella Bishop who was travelling around Joseon described values of The Independent ‚Äúin creating a public opinion which shall sit in judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.‚Äù (The Baltimore Sun, 1897). Additionally, the Korean edition was written entirely in Korean letters, Hangul, except for the few cases when it was necessary to use some Chinese characters. The Hangul was named as Eun mun (Ë´∫Êñá) meaning low-class letters. Using only Hangul allowed anyone to read this newspaper regardless of their social class. This strategy was attacked by high-class people, but the editorial kept Hangul because it was easy for everyone; everyone could be literate and therefore national pride and ultimately the independence of Korea would come out‚Äù (The Independent, April 7, 1896<strong>). (2) Cornerstone of the independence movement.</strong> Soon after <em>The Independence</em> was created, Jaisohn initiated the ‚ÄúIndependence Association‚Äù and then continued to be the guiding force of this association without making his role known in either its organization or its operations. Its activities were expanded to weekly public debates (Man-min-gong-dong-hoi, Ëê¨Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ) on national issues. These not only attracted wide interest but also served to educate the population, and, most directly, potential leaders in the arguments on all sides of scores of national issues. However, Jaisohn was forced out due to radical strategies of The Independence and Independence Association in 1896.

Epworth originally referred to Epworth, Lincolnshire, a town in England that was the birthplace of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, early leaders of the Methodist religious movement. This town‚Äôs name has been used for youth Christian association name in Methodist churches in the United States. Epworth league was initiated in 1889 in the U.S. and in 1897 in Joseon based on decisions from the World Methodist mission conference in Seoul. This was the first youth Christian association in Joseon. The youth enlightenment movement was in its embryonic stage in 1897 with efforts for modernization by Joseon government. Following up the <em>Donghak peasant uprising</em>, Joseon government implemented a series of reform to modernize all aspects of social system between 1894 and 1896 which was recognized as Gabo reform (Áî≤ÂçàÊîπÈù©). Finally, King Go-jong proclaimed a new empire called the Greater Korean Empire (Daehan jeguk, Â§ßÈüìÂ∏ùÂúã, 1897-1910). The progressive party leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, who were forced out after the failure of Gapshin Coup in 1884 and educated in the United States returned to Joseon to help government reform social system. Seo and Yun created the Independence newspaper and the independence club and educated youth in churches and Bai-jai school. Students in Yukeyong Gongwon (ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢) which was the first modernized national institute moved to Bai-jai school as the school was closed by Japanese force. Those students leaned public debate skills and modernized ideology about self-determination, self-reliance, social justice based on Christian doctrines by Seo and Yun.
</p>
<p>
Epworth league in Korea was initiated by Bishop I. W. Joyce and organized by Byeongsun Noh (Bai-Jai school, Jeongdong church), Gibum Kim (Gemulpo church), Eunsun Lee (Sangdong church), W.A. Noble (churches in Pyongyang), and J.O. Pain on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1897. Seo and Yun also actively involved in education of members, so many of the leaders and members of Epworth league mutually worked in the Independence Club.
</p>
<p>
The word ‚ÄúYoung men‚Äù (ÈùëÂπ¥) was used by this group for the first time. Christians who were in ages between 15 and 35 were eligible to be a member. A number of the local branches increased rapidly across Joseon. They announced their activities and program schedules in the first Christian newspaper, The Korean Christian Advocate (See the box XX). Local branches shared the updated information through this newspaper and general audience indirectly heard of the updated information of youth enlightened movement. In October 1897, 5 branches with 150 members were established (Cho, XX). Especially, the first young women Christian group, Joyce youth association was created as a part of the Epworth league in 1897. Epworth league focused on the work of Christian evangelization (Á¶èÈü≥ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) and became the independence movement and social reform movement. First, they held an open debate every week to discuss important social and Christian issues and took a lead in various patriotic (<mark>Âø†ÂêõÊÑõÂúã)</mark>public meetings. Second, they built ‚ÄúEveryday School‚Äù (<em>Maeil Hakgyo</em>, ÊØèÊó•Â≠∏Ê†°) next to churches to educate ordinary people and led the Hangul education campaign to abolish illiteracy and protect Joseon‚Äôs language, Hangul. Third, they supported the Independent club leaders who were jailed after the club was resolved by Japanese force in 1898. Sangjae Lee, Seungman Lee, Seungjun Yoo, Jungsik Kim, Jaegi Hong, Gukseon Ahn, Lin Kim, Wongung Lee, Donghwi Lee, Changho Ahn, Jun Lee, Sangsul Lee, Sigyeong Ju, and Uk Namgung who will be leaders of the national independence movement converted into Christianity while they were in jail. Lastly, Epworth network across Joseon became the resources hub for the national independence movement in 1905 and 1919.

Although this organization was not built as a part of Christian movement, these is not doubt direct and indirect influence of Christianity on activities and contributions of this club to developing Christian movement and social reform movement. Christian leaders, Jaisohn Seo and Chi-ho Yun, founded this club based on Christian doctrine with Western missionaries‚Äô support. (1) Built Dongnimmun Áç®Á´ãÈñÄ as a symbol of the independence of Korea from foreign power. China was the only foreign country with which Joseon had any real contact until the opening of Joseon by Japan in 1876. Of all these countries it was Joseon‚Äôs nearest neighbors-China, Japan, and Russia-who were most interested in exploiting their relations with Joseon. China was anxious to preserve the favorable position it already had in Joseon, Japan was planning to replace weakening China as the most influential power, while Russia was cautiously widening its influence in the area. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, China‚Äôs influence was getting withdrawn from Joseon. Jaisohn Seo and Independence club wanted a ‚Äúpermanent structure‚Äù built in order to commemorate Korean independence and sovereignty. With the intention of sending a strong message, Jaisohn tore down a centuries-old gate that had been used ‚Äúfor the purpose of receiving Chinese ambassadors‚Äù during coronation ceremonies for Korean kings. The cornerstone dedication ceremony of November 1896 had a Christian bent to it. No doubt, this was a result of Jaisohn‚Äôs own devout Christian faith and that of many of Jaisohn‚Äôs followers. Appenzeller, a missionary, prayed in Korean for ‚ÄúDivine blessing upon Korea and asked protection for Joseon‚Äôs independence. Until now, this arch is a landmark of Seoul and represents Koreans‚Äô desire for independence from foreign powers. (2) Sponsored a ‚ÄúJoint Conference of Government Officials and the People‚Äù (<em>Gwan-Min-Gong-dong-hoe</em>, ÂÆòÊ∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÊúÉ). The Independent Club had long thought that close cooperation with government officials would push the government to accept and carry out the general reforms suggested by the club. It was the first meeting in Joseon of its kind, bringing together the two groups, officials and plain citizens. The sponsors arranged that the many proposals and motions be discussed in the form of a document called the ‚ÄúSix Articles‚Äù (ÁçªË≠∞ÂÖ≠Ê¢ù). These were formally passed by the meeting; the government officials also signed them. It was formally submitted the Six Articles to King Go-jong and asked for his approval. The Six Articles were as follows:

King Go-jong announced the approval of the Six Articles and issued the ‚ÄúFive-Article Imperial Decree‚Äù which was generally consistent with what the Independence Club had advocated. However, the Independence Club confronted the conspiracy by their opponents. They argued that the Independence club will depose a king and establish the presidential system. In November 1898, King Go-jong ordered that all the leaders of the club be arrested and the club to be disbanded.

Seeds of Christianity including Catholicism and Protestantism were planted by Korean who were diplomats, scholars, and merchants. Christian teachings were introduced as a Western learning (ÏÑúÌïô Ë•øÂ≠∏), religion, or new spiritual training (ÎèÑ ÈÅì). Interestingly, early Protestant missionaries explained Christianity as ÎèÑ (ÈÅì, spiritual training) until 1910s rather than using Ï¢ÖÍµê (ÂÆóÊïé, religion) (Bang, 2021). Joseon (Korea) was going through an omnishambles in this era. Missionaries observed issues with slavery, poverty, corruption of government and officials, degradation against women and spread of opium. The people had fallen into a state of distress and superstitious practices. Progressive Korean politicians and scholars carried out a coup d‚Äôetat (<em>Gapsin coup</em>) to resolve these issues, but it was repressed by Go-jong and Queen Min in 1884. The first Protestant missionary Hoarce Allen arrived at Busan port in 1884 and saved the life of Young-ik Min, a relative of Queen Min, who was injured from this coup and became close to the king Go-jong. Even though the Gapsin coup failed, it brought all issues up to the public space. 10 years later of Gapin Coup, the Joseon society and their people still suffered from the same issues. Chi-ho Yun who was one of the leaderships of Gapsin coup described his feeling when he returned to Joseon after he spent a decade in exile in Japan, China, and the U.S.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI should be happier today because I‚Äôve just returned to my homeland. But alas! I couldn‚Äôt be more sorrowful. My poor brethren! Their clothes are like rags, tattered and filthy. Their houses are not even higher than the ground. My nostrils are constantly attacked by the stenches of the garbage piled up everywhere. Unbearable poverty, ignorance, people like idiots, denuded forests and empty fields. In all this, I hear the anguished moaning of my helpless mother land. (Yun, February 12, 1895, see Box).‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In 1890s, early missionaries and Korean Christian leaders begun fundamental transformation of the society through education and evangelical movement. The education movement will be explained in the later section. The social gospel movement was based on Christian teachings using five reform strategies here.

Prohibition of drinking and smoking: Christian leaders believed that drinking ruined people‚Äôs mental and physical health and led to poverty. ‚ÄúSince drinking hampers the enlightenment of our people, every right-minded man must strive to do away with the practice. Drinking deprives people of their wealth, rendering them beggars and thieves. It also leads many to extortion, bribery, negligence of their duty, expropriation of national wealth and their own poverty. (Christian Advocate, Dec.&nbsp;30, 1897)‚Äù Church leaders taught that drinking leads to sin against God, it makes men break church laws, and it tends to the abuse of parents, family, and self (Christian Advocate, Feb.&nbsp;3, 1899). Smoking was banned due to similar harmful effects on mental and physical health and financial status. In fact, heavy drinking behaviors of men and smoking of youth were prevalent at that time. Christian leaders attempted to reframe individual‚Äôs mindset and health behaviors as a small church of God and agency of social change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Prohibition of opium: Moffett, a Presbyterian missionary, reported that opium was being smuggled into Korea by Chinese merchants and that at least hundreds of people were already addicted (The Korean Repository. Volume 1, p.&nbsp;35, see the Box). Churches banned opium and disciplined their followers. Missionaries and Christian leaders recognized associations between the opium traffic network and Chinese merchants and Japanese government. This influenced the nationalist and their anti-Japanese resistance movement later.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Uprootedness of superstitious practices: Joseon was confronted with a great famine between 1890 and 1900 and various infectious disease. According to Shamanistic view, natural disasters and explosive chain of lethal transmission were interpreted on cause and effects relationships between human and spiritual world including <em>ki</em> (Ê∞£) and <em>kwishin</em> (È¨ºÁ•û spirits). Thus, people called smallpox caused by kwishin, <em>Ho-gui-ma-ma (</em>ËÉ°È¨ºÂ™ΩÂ™Ω). People visited mudang (Â∑´Â†Ç, female shaman) to expel kwishin from their body (Oak, 2010). Protestant missionaries brought western medical system. Churches and Christian leaders encouraged people to terminate all superstitious practices and reported that many cases of converts who destroyed their fetish and idols by themselves in newspapers and magazine. One example of 1897 touched Koreans‚Äô mind to respect their origin and nation and differentiated nationalism from superstitious practices. ‚ÄúOn the 18th of this month, several Christians entered <em>Kooksadang</em>, a shamanism shrine, in Mt. Namsan. They found that the painting of the Great King Taejo was being ill-treated amid the pictures of various evil spirits. They summoned the master of the house and told him to get rid of the pictures of the spirits and treat the King as a king. The owner of the house agreed that there was reason in what they were saying and did not interfere with the Christians when they removed all the paintings of the spirits and burned them, except of course for the painting of the King Taejo. These Christians are people who are faithfully carrying out the duties of this country. If there were more people like them in Korea, the prestige of the palace would be enhanced, and we would see fewer foolish things done in this land. (The Independent, July 27, 1897)‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Reform of the early marriage (Êó©Â©ö) and multiple marriage (concubinage, ËìÑÂ¶æÂà∂Â∫¶): The status of women will be discussed in the education movement section with more details. The rights to education, life, and liberty were not allowed for Korean women because of the old traditions such as early marriage, multiple marriage, preference for sons, and distorted Confucian conception of the patriarchal system. Churches and Christian leaders pointed out drawbacks of early marriage (The Independent, July 28, 1899, see the Box) and suggested four ways to get rid of the old established marital practices. ‚ÄúPeople must be taught that men and women are entitled to equal rights. Men and women must be given the equal opportunity to education. Parents must not influence marriage. A proper age for marriage must be set. (The Christian Advocate. April 19, 1899)‚Äù They also introduced the western marital system in the newspaper (The Independent, July 20, 1899. See the Box). Churches began a campaign to educate their followers to avoid early and multiple marriages. With this continuous effort, new feature of marriage based on Christianity was reported (The Christian Advocate. July 19, 1899).

<p>
In summary, Christianity was recognized as the root of the western civilization. For Koreans who were fed up with the corrupt government and power games among China, Japan, and Russia on the Korea Peninsula, adapting Christianity was the only channel to save their country and reform the demolished and impoverished society.

The Term Question was imported into the Korea mission field. John Ross of the United Presbyterian Church in Manchuria, in this first Korean New Testament (1877-1887), translated the name of God as <em>Hananim</em>, the Supreme Lord of Korean indigenous religion, on the basis of <em>Shangti</em> ‰∏äÂ∏ù(Sovereign on high) edition of the Delegates‚Äô Version. The first Korean Roman Catholics and later the Anglican missions in Korea adopted <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em> Â§©‰∏ª (the Lord of Heaven), following Catholic practice in China. A Korean diplomat in Japan Su Jung Lee, adopted <em>Shin</em> Á•û(Generic term of god) from <em>Shen</em> edition of the Chinese Bible, in his Korean Bible translations (1883-1885). The need to choose between the Korean theistic terms, consequently triggered the Term Question in Korea from 1882 to 1911. There was a terminological controversy between an indigenous theistic term (<em>Shangt</em>i and <em>Hananim</em>) on the on hand and a neologism (<em>T‚Äôienzhu</em> and Korean <em>Ch‚Äôonzhu</em>) or a generic term (<em>Shen</em> and Korean <em>Shin</em>) on the other hand. Central to both Term Questions was the theological issue of whether a primitive monotheism, congruent with Christian belief, had existed among the Chinese and Koreans. It suggested that whilst those who adhered to a degeneration theory of the history of religions used wither <em>Shangti</em> or <em>Hananim</em> as the name of the God of the Bible, those who rejected the existence of primitive monotheism preferred to use the neologism or the generic term. There was another issue with a significant divergence between a vast majority (of the <em>Hananim</em> party) and a small minority (the opponents of <em>Hananim</em>). It is argued that the disproportion in Korean in favor of <em>Hananim</em> was due to the much closer analogy between <em>Hananim</em> and the Christian trinity, as seen in the Dan-Gun myth, than was the case with <em>Shangti</em> in Chinese religion. Eventually, Korean Christians and missionaries adopted the indigenous monotheistic term, <em>Hananim</em>, in a Christian form contributed to the higher rate of growth of the Korean Church compared to that of the church in China.

12-year-old King Go-jong (r. 1864-1907) was enthroned in Joseon in 1866) and his father, the Dae-wongun, was given regent powers for the first ten years of King Go-jong‚Äôs kingship. Although the Daewongun was tolerant of Catholics in the early years of his rule, he later pursued a closed-door isolationist policy as to the increasing pressure and threat from foreign powers to open Joseon ports. When two French ships anchored off the island of Gangahwa in 1886 and easily defeated Korean defenses, ministers in the royal court advised negotiation with them. In response, the Daewongun ordered a large sign posted on one of the pillars in the royal hall that read: ‚ÄúThe ocean barbarians have invaded. Not to fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;197). Other conservative ministers in the court reiterated the political slogan ‚ÄúDefend Orthodoxy, Reject Heterodoxy‚Äù (Lee, 1996, p.&nbsp;535).
</p>
<p>
In the early years of Daewongun‚Äôs rule, there were over 20,000 Joseon Catholic followers and 12 French priests working covertly in Joseon. The spread of Catholicism reached every province in Joseon. The Daewongun was determined to annihilate every vestige of this religion. In 1866, the Daewongun unleashed a full-scale anti-Catholic campaign that resulted in deaths of nigh French priests, including Bishop Berneux, and over 8,000 Koreans. That is, half of the membership of the church suffered martyrdom. From 1785 to 1886, scholars estimated that over 10,00 Catholics died in the century of persecutions.

A series of peasant rebellions which began from 1862 throughout the country reached a peak in one monumental uprising, the Donghak peasant rebellion, in 1894. The Donghak movement founded by Choi Je Woo in 1860 in the Gyeongsang area blended ideas from different religions such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Roman Catholicism. The movement emphasized human rights as shown in <em>Innaechon</em> which means that the human being is viewed as heaven. In Choi‚Äôs opinion, people should worship this heaven residing in their body. Moreover, he had an apocalyptic view of history that the messianic kingdom of equality was coming. It spread out into the southern area of Korea where the common peasants were most ruthlessly exploited and tortured by the corrupted officials. However, it was banned and its founder was executed due to its radical doctrines against the socio-political Confucian foundations of the Joseon dynasty.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the common people were suffering from the double torture of the excessive tax burdens by the corrupted officials and the harsh exploitation of foreign forces. The aim of the rebellion was ‚Äúinwardly to punish corrupt officials and outwardly to drive away foreign barbarians‚Äù (Oh, 1940p. 112). The uprisings were brutally suppressed, and the leaders were killed by Chinese and Japanese military interventions. This uprising proposed a new way to articulate and protect the traditional beliefs among Koreans.

: Overall, how restrictive were the regulations on religion or some aspects of religion and how suppressive of the state over religion? Was there a state religion de jure or de facto? Were there privileged religions during this decade? (500-1000 words)

<p>
Severe persecutions took place in 1801, 1839, and 1846. Daewongun‚Äôs policy of exclusion, about eight thousand Catholics, including five French missionaries, were executed in 1866. This is the last and most severe persecution against Catholicism. What prompted the latest persecution was the external pressures on Korea at the time. With the collapse of the central power in China and Japan‚Äôs opening to the West in the 1850s, the Western influence in Joseon was imminent and unavoidable. In fact, between 1866 and 1871 Joseon faced hostile contacts from three military powers: the Russian Empire, France, and the United States. In the decade following King Go-jong‚Äôs ascension, the Catholic Church was, at last, free from persecution. While the anti-foreign/Catholicism sentiment was still strong, the court‚Äôs realization of the need to form an alliance with western power precluded further persecution of Catholicism. As a consequence, Joseon opened her ports to western missionaries and the first Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen arrived at Busan in 1884. They were not allowed to stay or buy houses outside Seoul, but they were not rejected by the government.
</p>
<p>
Early protestant missionaries reported that Koreans as a people without a religion (Underwood, 1908, see the Box). This impression was due to the fact that when the missionaries arrived in Korea, all ancient faiths were in a state of collapse and there was no distinct and controlling religion (Paik, 1980). In fact, three traditional faiths had claimed the Korean people: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Especially, Confucianism was the dominant ideology throughout the 500-year history of Joseon dynasty. It became part of Korean culture from then on.

: Only upper class, Yangban, learned Confucian classics (Êº¢Â≠∏) in the traditional education. The missionaries brought new form of education to Joseon. The missionary school focused on training young men in three areas: mental, moral, and spiritual. The first students of the mission schools were mostly from lower class, <em>Cheonmin</em> Ë≥§Ê∞ëand <em>Sangmin</em> Â∏∏Ê∞ë. The primacy of Bai-chai (<mark>ÂüπÊùê)</mark> college and other mission schools was the teaching of Christ. Bunker explained it this way:
</p>
<p>
The brief outline does not take into consideration the constant personal influence of the Christian teacher upon the scholar, nor the wholesome uplift given to a crude boy by breathing the atmosphere of a Christian institution. Nor in this connection should mention of the nature of our textbooks be omitted. Our books are edited on strictly religious principles. They contain prayers, and many helpful hints as to God, His goodness, power and love as to Christ and his power to save all who call upon Him. There are many thoughts along these and similar lines which tend to turn the minds of the students into proper channels. One of our boys closed a letter to the writer with a benediction quoted from St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs writings. Not a bad beginning for a Bai-Chai boy. Certainly, a god ending. (1896, p.&nbsp;361. See the box)
</p>
<p>
Jaisohn and other progressive Christian leaders served as teachers in Bai-chai high school and college and many of those students got involved in <em>Hyeopsunghoe</em> (ÂçîÊàêÊúÉ) and the Independence Club. These associations fought official corruption, inefficiency, and timidity toward foreign aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Women played a vital role in the education of Korean girls. Methodist Mary Scranton founded her school in June 1886 in Seoul with a single pupil, a child found lying against the city wall with her mother who was suffering from typhus (Clark, 2003). Scranton‚Äôs school became known as Ewha which was the first educational institution for women. Because of Ewha and other schools, a Korea woman‚Äôs life experienced a revolution. No longer was she reduced to the duties of reverence to ancestors and hospitality to guests. For once, the monopoly on knowledge did not belong solely to men for knowledge became just as important to them as to men for the full enjoyment and development of life.

: Korea is a peninsula located between Japan on the east, the Korea Straits on the south and the Yellow Sea on the west. To the north, it is separated from China by the Amnok and Tuman Rivers. Eleven miles of the Tuman River from a border with Russia. The geographical setting of Korea made it the likely prey of its neighbors. Korea was attached by Japan in 1592 and the Manchurians in 1636. From then on, the country never completely recovered and followed isolationism. During the nineteenth century, the political system became corrupt as practically to preclude securing justice. During this period, the door of Korea was forced open, and Daewon gun implemented an intensive close-door policy as his son, Go-jong, came to throne. The political power game between Daewon gun and his daughter-in-law, Queen Min, reshaped relationships with foreign countries during the late nineteenth century. Daewon gun maintained diplomatic relations with only Qing Dynasty and ostracized Western powers and Japan (1852-1876). This political stance resulted in General Sherman Incident with the U.S. (1866), the French campaign against Korea (‰∏ôÂØÖÊ¥ãÊìæ) of 1866, rejection to Japanese‚Äô sovereign‚Äôs message (1868), Korea Expedition with the U.S. (1871) and the following persecutions for Christians, mostly Catholics. He built the anti-appeasement steles (Êñ•ÂíåÁ¢ë) to remember his principles to denounce the western and Japanese power. However, his reform failed to get rid of corrupted officials and construct a strong country. Queen Min incarcerated him in a small palace. Go-jong and Queen Min signed treaties open the door to Japan in 1876 and the U.S. in 1882. Her administration committee positive relationships with Japan and western countries to hold the Russia‚Äôs expansion at the beginning. However, she lost the balance of her political directions among foreign powers and internal social and political issues. Compared to Daewon gun, she overly dependent on Qing dynasty and Japan to suppress <em>Imo Gullan</em> (Â£¨ÂçàËªç‰∫Ç) and Donghak peasant revolution (Êù±Â≠∏Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÈù©ÂëΩ). This intervention resulted in First Sino-Japanese War (1894).
</p>
<p>
The onset of the Sino-Japanese war on the first of August 1894 devasted the Korean land and plunged the Korean people into a welter of terror until it reached the Shimonoseki Treaty on April 17 in 1895. Chinese military was routed by Japan and lost its imperial power in Korea. In the midst of the war, Japan pressed the Korean government to change structurally by recalling the scattered progressives. The reputed political traitors of the Gap-sin coup in 1884 were able to return to Korea around this time. Philip Jaisohn and Chi-ho Yun (who will be introduced in the next decade section) came back to Korea. Japan subsequently installed a task-oriented supra-government reform organ, the Deliberative Council (<em>Kun‚Äôguk Kimuch‚Äôo</em>, <mark>ËªçÂúãÊ©üÂãôËôï), largely manned by those progressives that seemingly implemented, what the progressives had originally sought. The reinstated Korean progressives and the reform, a measure welcomed by the progressives, were in fact a long-term instrument to break up the Korean leadership. Japan supported Buddhism, Shintoism, and other forms of Japanese religions in Seoul to compete against Christianity to expand Japanese power in the East Asia (Weems, 1962).</mark>

:As stated above, Christian-majority countries were ostracized until Go-jong and Queen Min took their administration power from Daewon gun in 1876. The first step was to sign the United States-Korea Treaty in 1882. This treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status. This template was modeled in treaties with European nations such as Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, and France in 1886.

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a nationalist ritual can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

The Independence Club held regular debates that were opened to the public. It debated various topics using parliamentary procedure so that all voices could have a hearing and communication could be established on an equal footing. When this debating club discussed corruption, independence, injustice, and inequality. It began to become a locus of political agitation. In 1898, Jaisohn organized mass demonstrations to demand various changes from the government. This marked the beginning of the Manmingongdonghoe. This mobilization of broad support for political demands inevitably made enemies among both government officials and foreign diplomats, especially the Russians, who then enjoyed an unrivaled influence on the Korean government. Pro-Christian leaders wer often elected to represent this association. Besides drawing its leadership from the Christian community, this association also had strong support among the Christians, who were more open to reformist values and ideology than any other group. The association between pro-Christian leaders and the Manmingongdonghoe was further demonstrated by the independence movement.

The Baby Riots of 1888 took place in the summer of 1888 in Joseon Korea. It was reported by Dr.&nbsp;L. Horton Underwood, one of the first female medical doctors, as well as female missionaries in Korea, and the wife of Rev.&nbsp;Horace G. Underwood, the first American Presbyterian missionary to the country. The uproar against Western medicine, hospitals and foreign schools-and foreigners in general-came just a few years after the first American Protestant missionaries started their work in Joseon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome person or persons, with malicious intent, started a rumor which spread like wildfire that foreigners were paying wicked Koreans to steal native children in order to cut their hearts and eyes out to be used for medicine‚Ä¶.. Babies, it was said, had been eaten at the German, English, and Americal legation, and the hospital, of course was considered by all the headquarters of this bloodthirsty work, for there, where medicine was manufactured and diseases threated, the babies must certainly be butchered.‚Äù (Underwood, 1904, see the Box).
</p>
<p>
For some weeks, the excitement among the people became so great that the lives and property of foreigners, especially missionaries, were thought to be in peril (Scranton et al., 1888). Finally, the rumor provoked a riot in which several Koreans died. Rumors of the barbarous crimes of missionaries and foreigners fueled a furious mob that assaulted a Korean office on street and gathered to attack a foreign school for women founded by an American Methodist missionary, M.F. Scranton, who recalled that, ‚ÄòOne day a crowd gathered outside our gate and accused our servants of having stolen children and sold them to me for money, and threatened to kill them‚Äô (Scranton et al., 1888). In addition to this incident, on other occasions crowds gathered about the gate and threatened to kill the servants: ‚ÄôGuards were appointed, who vigilantly patrolled our compounds and we held ourselves, in accordance with the direction of our U.S. Minister, in constant readiness to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice; (Scranton, 1896). In view of these persistent attempts to attack the compound, missionaries had to be ready to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At the peak of the riot, Scranton also had to close the women‚Äôs school temporarily. Eventually, this incident brought about the diplomatic and military intervention of the USA, France and Russia, because foreigners and missionaries in general were accused of evil behaviors.

An instance of persecution in Pyongyang in 1894, shortly before the Donghak Rebellion, provides a good case in point of anti-foreign and anti-Christian atmosphere. At that time, Pyongyang was not a treaty city and foreign residence was not permitted there, much less the Christian religion. Yet, both the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries had visited this city and made several converts there. Their justification for their activities was that the Japanese were already there and that Americans should deserve the same rights of residence as citizens of a most-favored-nation. Moreover, they purchased property in the name of local converts and made it into a clandestine church. However, the illegal Christian intrusion was soon detected by local residents and reported to the local authorities. The governor of Pyongyang quickly arrested and jailed the native Christians who had helped the foreigners, while the missionaries were saved from the same fate due to their extraterritorial status. Missionaries responded to local Christian requests ‚Äúto secure protection for them,‚Äù by sending an urgent telegraph to the American and British legations in Seoul to press the Korean Foreign Ministry to release the Christians in Pyongyang. The Korean government responded quickly, but the governor, who possessed considerable power as a close relative of the current Queen, resisted the release order from the central government and continued torturing the Christians in prison. To make matters worse, the missionary residence in the city was sieged by a local anti-Christian mob. The house was stoned and the wall was torn down, while native water carriers were blocked from supplying water to the foreigners. In the vent, the governor surrendered to the central government and the Korean Christians were released, but the Pyongyang Persecution in 1894 provides further proof that there was no official or legal sanction for Christian mission work in Korea.

Despite the real sense that Joseon government was turning a blind eye toward missionary work, its optimism was nevertheless unfounded and did not reflect the reality of the foreign mission in Korea. The extension of Protestant mission work without official government sanctioning caused as many political complications with Korean government and society as the Catholics. The Protestant followed the Catholic‚Äôs lead to justify its illegal mission work under the unequal treaty and there was no difference between the two missions in terms of their neglect of Korean sovereignty and local jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In fact, anti-missionary opposition was conspicuous from the very beginning of the Protestant missions. When the Presbyterian mission began a hospital and an orphanage in Seoul, a vicious rumor soon spread among the local populace that the missionaries were sending them Koreans to America as Alaves and fattening them up for the table (Underwood, 1886). In 1887, street shops in Seoul closed in unison-a traditional means of expressing popular dissatisfaction-and Seoul merchants demanded the removal of all foreigners from the city center to suburban Yongsan, outside the city gate.

Was there any tension between nationalism/patriotism and Christianity in general?

Nationalism can be expressed in interaction rituals that create a ‚Äúnationalist aesthetics‚Äù that leads people to become emotionally invested in the nation. A shared emotion produced by a <strong>nationalist ritual</strong> can generate a powerful emotional energy that produces strong feelings of solidarity, confidence, and righteousness among a group of people who are connected symbolically. These strong feelings may be transformed into anger and violent actions against those who disrespect the group (Collins 1975, 1999, 2004; Kane and Park 2009).

Land and property ownership in Korea between the 1880s-1900s was somewhat chaotic. Due in part to locals‚Äô unpreparedness, the situation was brought on by opportunistic foreigners who pushed the limits of law and treaty regulations. The issue of foreigners buying up real estate was even a problem in the center of Seoul. By the 1900s, English-language reports show that the private sale or lease of real estate to Japanese, Chinese, and Western migrants outside of designated settlement treaty areas or treaty regulations had become rampant.

Relationship between Donghak and Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism) cannot be simply viewed as a relationship of rejection. Donghak, which emerged with the motto ‚ÄúCheokwaeyang‚Äù Êñ•ÂÄ≠Ê¥ã (Rejecting Western and Japanese Influence) advocated by Choi Je-u who began the propagation in 1861, marked a significant milestone in Korean modern national history around the 1890s. Donghak incorporated Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs as its core, and emerged as a national religion for a short period, rapidly spreading among the people even while facing suppression of Catholicism‚Äôs missionary activities.
</p>
<p>
Due to Choi Je-u‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúCheonju‚Äù Â§©‰∏ª (Heavenly Lord), Donghak was initially misunderstood as a branch of Western learning and faced persecution.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Catholicism: Catholicism was referred to as ‚ÄúSeohak‚Äù (Western Learning). Despite being criticized as a religion of foreign powers and facing persecution due to ancestral rites issues and the concept of ‚ÄúMubumugun‚Äù ÁÑ°Áà∂ÁÑ°Âêõ (No Father, No Lord), the number of believers increased due to the involvement of the common people. However, several severe persecutions exacerbated social turmoil. Hence, Donghak intentionally emphasized its distinction from Seohak and Sahak ÈÇ™Â≠∏ (evil learning).
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was called Donghak, Êù±Â≠∏ meaning Eastern Learning of Dongguk Êù±Âúã (East Country). And Seohak, Western Learning, is yin Èô∞, while Donghak is yang ÈôΩ, aiming to suppress yin with yang. Westerners lack order in speech, coherence in writing, and are solely interested in personal gain through evil tricks, lacking the Ê∞£Âåñ transformation in their bodies and the teachings of the heavens in their learning; they have only form but no essence. By not revering the heavens, Western learning is close to emptiness, and the learning has departed from the teachings of the heavens.‚Äù (Donggyeong Daejeon Nonhak Mun, p.&nbsp;264)
</p>
<p>
Choi Je-u expressed caution towards the Catholic attitude towards ancestral rites. However, he himself faced criticism for adhering to Western learning. The initial stance of Catholics towards Donghak seems to have been marked by resentment by early French missionaries, likely due to the harsh persecution Donghak forces inflicted upon Catholic believers during the Donghak Revolution of 1894 in Jeonju and Gongju (Yoon Chi-ho‚Äôs Diary). However, an indicator of a possibly favorable relationship is the case of An Jung-geun, a Catholic who resonated with the rejection of foreign influence and joined Donghak followers in attacking a prison together in Northwestern areas.
</p>
<p>
Relationship with Protestantism: Initially, it was a relationship of rejection, especially with significant church damages in the southern Honam region. However, in the northwest, a common goal of anti-Japanese struggle was established. While Catholicism held an overall conflictual relationship, Protestantism formed different relationships in the southern and northwestern regions respectively. Particularly, McKenzie, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary in the northwest, engaged in missionary work while living among Koreans in traditional small, thatched homes and caring for the poor. Despite the Donghak forces‚Äô combat in this region, records show that Donghak military was impressed by him and received baptism.
</p>
<p>
An example of rejection and protest occurred in the ‚ÄúBokhap Sangso‚Äù ‰ºèÈñ§‰∏äÁñè petition at Gwanghwamun in March 1893. It was a protest against the Joseon government‚Äôs recognition of Catholicism and Protestantism while refusing to acknowledge Donghak. Christian rejection notices were posted on American consulate buildings and missionary homes. The missionaries were criticized for acts like conducting unauthorized schools, collecting donations, and warned to return to their own country, with the accusation of pursuing self-interest. Joseon‚Äôs protection shielded the missionaries from harm, but efforts to understand each other were present in areas like Soraesa Church in the northern region where McKenzie and Reverend Seo Gyeong-jo were active. The church also offered protection to Donghak forces (January 1895). This cooperative effort extended with Son Byeong-hee forming the Progressive Society and Christian Seo Sang-ryun becoming its leader, eventually leading to the March 1 Movement.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the exchange of faith practices between Protestantism and Donghak is explained through the concepts of temperament and morning prayer (Hwang, 2014). Donghak followers adhere to five principles: spells Ï£ºÎ¨∏(Âë™Êñá), clear water Ï≤≠Ïàò(Ê∑∏Ê∞¥), Holy Lord‚Äôs day ÏãúÏùº(‰æçÊó•), rice offering ÏÑ±ÎØ∏(Ë™†Á±≥), and prayer Í∏∞ÎèÑ(Á•àÁ¶±). Clear water refers to the blood spilled when Choi Je-u died, and it symbolizes washing the body. Holy Lord‚Äôs day signifies Sunday, which in Protestantism is considered a holy day. Rice offering involves collecting a spoonful of rice from each person‚Äôs meal, saved up and offered to the church at the end of each month. Morning prayer refers to prayers done upon waking up in the morning.
