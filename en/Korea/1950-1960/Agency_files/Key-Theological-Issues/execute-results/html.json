These divisions were not merely administrative, but rather the result of deep theological disagreements, divergent political ideologies, and contrasting interpretations of church polity. Central to this period were three major breakaways: the Kosin denomination in 1952, the Korean Christian Church (Kijang) in 1953, and the split between Tonghap and Hapdong in 1959. Each schism revealed underlying tensions related to doctrine, church governance, and the global ecumenical movement, and each group developed distinct constitutional responses to these challenges.\n\n\nHistorical and Theological Background\n\nTheological divergence began brewing in the 1930s and 40s, especially concerning modernist and fundamentalist approaches to scripture, the role of the church in society, and the interpretation of confessions. The immediate post-war years intensified these debates. The Kosin group separated over issues of Shinto shrine worship and doctrinal purity. The formation of the Kijang denomination stemmed from conflicts surrounding Rev. Kim Jae-joon and Chosun Seminary, particularly the desire to preserve freedom of theological inquiry. Finally, the Tonghap–Hapdong split in 1959 centered around ecumenical engagement, the WCC, and internal church politics involving delegate selection and financial scandals.\n\n\nThe formation of Kijang and Its Constitutional Vision\n\nThe Korean Christian Church (Kijang) was officially formed in 1953, soon after the 1952 General Assembly removed Rev. Kim Jae-joon from ministry. The Kijang church prioritized freedom of conscience, historical-critical theology, and a socially engaged gospel. Its constitutional development reflected these values. In 1956, the denomination revised the polity section of its constitution, abolishing traditional learner classes, introducing the office of assistant pastors, and authorizing the ordination of women. In 1972, the church adopted a new Confession of Faith that emphasized contextual and reconciliation-oriented theology, moving beyond the Westminster Confession.\n\n\nThe Tonghap-Hapdong Division and Conflicting Politics\n\nThe 1959 General Assembly in Daejeon became the setting for the final rupture between conservatives aligned with the NAE (National Association of Evangelicals) and moderates who accepted participation in the WCC under conditions. The controversy over the Gyeonggi Presbytery’s delegate list and the General Assembly’s vote to accept delegates from an 'irregular' session resulted in the NAE faction walking out and forming a separate body. Tonghap emphasized church unity, mission, and ecumenical openness, while Hapdong focused on doctrinal exclusivity and anti-ecumenism. Their divergent approaches became codified in their respective constitutions and theological education systems.\n\n\nTable 1. Key Issues in Schism and Comparative Positions\n\n| Issue | Tonghap (Unified) Perspective | Hapdong (Separated) Perspective |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Immediate Cause | Political conflict post Park Hyung-ryong’s financial scandal | WCC participation and ecumenical deviation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stance on WCC | Initially neutral, later conditionally accepted withdrawal | Strongly opposed, framed as liberal and pro-communist |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Role of NAE | Criticized as a church power bloc | Seen as representing true evangelical identity |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gyeonggi Presbytery Incident | Emphasis on procedural legitimacy and reorganization | Claimed voting fraud and maintained legitimacy of regular presbytery |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| General Assembly Procedure | Asserted democratic decision-making through official vote | Denounced result as illegitimate due to missionary influence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Role of Missionaries | Criticized for taking sides and supporting ecumenical camp | Viewed as political interference and a threat to church autonomy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nTable 2.

Based on American Presbyterianism, it incorporated key principles of governance that initially unified the church. These included:\n\nRepresentative government: authority resides in elected elders and ministers.\n\nCollegial leadership: governance is shared through a hierarchy of church courts.\n\nConstitutionalism: church governance must conform to established written laws.\n\nConnectionalism: congregations are part of a wider web of mutual accountability.\n\nOver time, the interpretation of these principles diverged. Kijang adapted them flexibly for contextual mission, Tonghap maintained a centralized polity emphasizing unity and outreach, and Hapdong focused on strict adherence and local church purity.\n\n\n**Comparative Analysis of the Constitutions of Three Major Korean Presbyterian Denominations\n\n\nThe Korean Christian Church (Kijang), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap), and the General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong), these churches diverged in the 1950s due to theological, political, and ecclesiological differences. Their constitutions reflect distinct theological commitments, ecclesial structures, and responses to modernity, ecumenism, and gender inclusion. Below is a structured comparison of their constitutional principles.\n\n\nTable 3. Comparative Overview of Constitutional Differences\n\n| Category | Kijang (Korean Christian Church) | Tonghap (Presbyterian Church of Korea) | Hapdong (General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Confession of Faith | 1972 Confession emphasizing historical and contemporary theology (e.g., Barmen, Nicene). | Westminster Confession + 12 creeds with adaptive interpretations. | Strict adherence to Westminster Confession with conservative interpretation. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amendment Approach | Actively revised in response to theology and mission needs. | Moderate openness to revision with procedural emphasis. | Very cautious; preservation of original doctrines. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ordination of Women | Ordained women as elders (1974) and pastors (1994). | Women elders allowed; pastors permitted since 2014 in some presbyteries. | No female ordination; women serve only as deaconesses. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Church Government | General Assembly-centered; ecumenical emphasis. | General Assembly-focused with collaborative polity. | Presbytery-focused; local autonomy and orthodoxy emphasized. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ecumenical Engagement | Active member of WCC, WARC, NCC. | Conditionally cooperative with WCC and global bodies. | Strongly opposed to WCC; anti-ecumenical stance. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Seminary and Theology | Progressive theological education (Hanshin Univ.). | Evangelical and holistic theology (Presbyterian Univ. & Theological Seminary). | Conservative Reformed theology (Chongshin Seminary). |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Church Discipline | Focused on restoration and dialogue over punishment. | Balanced legal procedure and ecclesial integrity. | Strict application; disciplinary measures against heresy. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Worship and Liturgy | Flexible, culturally adapted worship. | Traditional but open to modernization. | Strict adherence to traditional Reformed liturgy. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nTable 4. Summary of Constitutional Tendencies\n\n| Aspect | Kijang | Tonghap | Hapdong |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| General Theological Orientation | Progressive | Moderate | Conservative |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stance on Ecumenism | Fully Supportive | Conditional | Opposed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Women in Leadership | Fully Inclusive | Partially Inclusive | Exclusive |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Constitutional Interpretation | Contextual and Adaptive | Balanced and Practical | Literal and Protective |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n\nThe constitutional structures of the three Presbyterian denominations reveal their broader theological and ecclesiological commitments. Kijang emphasizes progressive theology and contextual application of tradition, Tonghap balances evangelical faith with adaptive unity, and Hapdong strongly defends conservative orthodoxy and polity. These differences continue to shape their engagement with society, global Christianity, and internal governance.\n\n\nDivision, Unification, and the Emergence of New Denominations: Korean Methodist Church and Other Denominations\n\nThe 1950s was a transformative era for Korean Christianity. Following liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Korea faced internal religious conflict, political upheaval, and the Korean War. These challenges catalyzed divisions, reunifications, and the formation of new denominations across Protestant churches, especially within the Korean Methodist Church. These developments reflected not merely political strife but deep theological and ecclesial concerns about purity, identity, and leadership in the post-colonial church.\n\n\nDivision within the Methodist Church: The Rebuilding Group vs. the Revival Group\n\nImmediately after Korea’s liberation in 1945, the Korean Methodist Church was torn apart by debates over Japan-era collaboration and theological renewal. The Rebuilding Group (Jaegeonpa), composed of figures like Lee Gyugap and Byun Honggyu, denounced the complicity of Methodist leaders who had engaged in Shinto shrine worship during the colonial period. In December 1945, they declared the reestablishment of the \"Methodist Church of Korea\" and launched separate assemblies and institutions, calling for ecclesiastical purification and the restoration of pre-1939 Methodist traditions.\n\nIn contrast, the Revival Group (Bokheungpa), led by Kang Taehee and others, emphasized revival and growth over reckoning with the past. They argued that the priority should be the church’s spiritual and organizational restoration, not political purging.\n\nThis split resulted in parallel church structures, including rival annual conferences, theological seminaries, and general assemblies. The two sides fought over church properties and authority, often resulting in disruption at the local church level.\n\n\nUnification and the Founding of the Korean Methodist Church\n\nAs tensions escalated, laity groups and American Methodist missionaries, particularly Rev. Jesse W. Jones, mediated reconciliation between the factions. In April 1949, both sides agreed to dissolve their separate structures and form a unified denomination. This union was formalized at the “Unification General Assembly” at Chungdong First Methodist Church, which established the new denomination: “The Korean Methodist Church (KMC)”. Rev. Kim Yusun was elected the first general superintendent. May 1st was declared “Union Sunday,” symbolizing denominational healing. Notably, the Western Annual Conference withheld participation, and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 further hindered reconstruction efforts.\n\n\nPostwar Restructuring and the Rise of Bishop Ryu Hyungki\n\nAfter Kim Yusun was taken to North Korea during the war, Rev. Ryu Hyungki was elected as the new bishop in a 1951 emergency assembly in Busan. A progressive theologian trained in the U.S., Ryu introduced historical-critical methods and held liberal views, including the denial of Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. Following the war, American Methodist missions injected substantial support for reconstruction. Nearly $1 million USD was allocated to rebuild schools, hospitals, orphanages, and churches. As a result, the denomination grew significantly: from around 45,000 members in 1951 to over 120,000 by 1957.\n\n\nA New Division: The Hoheon Group vs. the Ryu Hyungki Faction\n\nDespite postwar growth, internal conflicts resumed. The most notable was the “Mission Fund Incident” (선교불사건), where a failed dollar-based trade investment led to a loss of over $30,000. Critics accused the General Board, led by Bishop Ryu, of secularizing church operations and violating church law. In response, the Hoheon Group, consisting of pastors like Kim Eungtae and Um Jaehee, formed a “Committee for Denominational Rectification” in 1954. In 1955, they established their own annual conference, elected new officers, and launched the “Hoheon Methodist Church” in opposition to what they saw as church corruption and concentration of power. This schism led to serious legal disputes over church properties and violent clashes between opposing congregants in churches such as Chungang and Dongdaemun.\n\n\nDivisions in Other Denominations\n\nHoliness Church (Sungkyul)\n\nThe Holiness Church (Seonggyeol) was divided over its stance toward the World Council of Churches (WCC). One faction supported ecumenism, while another aligned with the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE). These differing theological orientations ultimately led to organizational splits.\n\n\nBaptist Church\n\nThe Korean Baptist Church, receiving support from the Southern Baptist Convention in the U.S., aimed for revitalization but eventually experienced division due to internal disputes over leadership and authority.\n\n\nThe 1950s was a crucible of crisis and transformation for Korean Protestantism. The Methodist Church experienced two waves of division and unification, shaped by debates over Japanese collaboration, theological direction, and denominational leadership. Similar patterns were evident in other denominations. Despite these disruptions, church membership, seminary education, and international mission support all expanded during this time, laying the groundwork for the contemporary Korean church structure.\n\n\n ",
