<p>
What is the leader‚Äôs commonly used Romanized name? Please use the form: surname, first name [example: Sun, Zhongshan]
</p>
<p>
: Lee, Seoung-Hun
</p>
<p>
Please summarize the key contributions for Christianity the leader made during this decade.
</p>
<p>
His contribution is characterized national advancement movement through educating the next-generation. Lee was born in the lower class but succeeded on his own business. During the Sino-Japanese war, his business went broke and went into retreat at his hometown in 1905 when the Joseon-Japan treat was established. Josen lost its diplomatic rights and Lee joined Seo-woo-Hak-hoe which was a youth enlightenment and literacy campaign organization in Northwest region (Pyongan)of Korea. In 1907 when the Hague Secret Emissary Agency failed to declare the invalidity of Japanese diplomatic maneuvers and Gojong was impeached by Japan, Lee listened to Ahn Chang-ho‚Äôs salvation of nation speech about protecting the national rights in Pyongyang.
</p>
<p>
Seung-hoon, having heard about Ahn Chang-ho for some time, decided to go and listen to his speech. When he arrived, he found a gathering of people, and at the center of it all was a passionate young man in his thirties dressed in a suit, addressing the crowd. He spoke about the state of the world, how Western civilization was using its power to influence the East, and how Japan, after learning from its experiences in the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars, was determined to absorb our country with the approval of the United Kingdom. He emphasized that to preserve our homeland with its 4,000 years of history, we must discard all the bad habits of the past and prioritize education, uniting the people to become something new. (Ham, 1988, p.&nbsp;31, recited in Kim, 2014, p.&nbsp;61).
</p>
<p>
There were two directions were facilitated in the Korean society to salvage the nation. One direction was armed independence campaign and the other was enlightenment and literacy campaign. Establishment of school and educating the youth was training the elite scholar military who will save the nation in the foreseeable future. In 1907, he founded Osan school at the Hyanggyo, Confucian institute, at Jeongju, Pyongan province. In 1910, he converted into Christians influenced by the great revival movement in Pyongyang and other North Korea regions. Lee listened to Han Seok-jin‚Äôs semon who was one of the first graduates from the Pyongyang theological seminary. Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross was interpreted as Korean people‚Äôs difficulties to survive and believed that Christianity which emphasizes love, service, and devotion was a way to unite Koreans.
</p>
<p>
Framing Christian Education. He returned to school, gathered the staff and students, and made a commitment to believe in Jesus Christ, deciding to hold religious gatherings at the school. He believed that the Christian spirit emphasizing dedication, service, and love could be the catalyst for the entire nation to regain strength and unity. Consequently, in December of that year, he changed the school‚Äôs educational leader based on Christian beliefs, appointing Pastor Slacy L. Robert as the principal and began teaching Bible studies. Later on, Teacher Yu Yeong-mo and Teacher Jo Man-sik, who would become principals, played crucial roles in establishing a strong foundation for faith education at Osan School. Although, in November 1923, due to the Japanese Education Decree of 1922, the Christian educational leadership was removed, and the school became a general institution, the atmosphere of religious gatherings and prayer continued within the school. It is said that hymns echoed through the school morning and evening, fostering a sense of camaraderie among colleagues.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Nam Kang based his education on Christian values, making reverence, love, and sincerity (Êï¨ÊÑõË™†) the purpose of education. This involved respecting God and teachers (Êï¨), loving the nation and the country (ÊÑõ), and cultivating students who live truthfully and sincerely without falsehood (Ë™†). This educational purpose aligns with Osan School‚Äôs motto of ‚ÄòLove, Sincerity, and Respect.‚Äô His emphasis on righteousness (Áæ©) in education is well-reflected in Christian principles. He taught students to prioritize faith in their education, rejecting falsehood, laziness, selfishness, and cunning, and instead, always acting, learning, and living with a noble purpose. Nam Kang often quoted the Bible in his teachings, emphasizing, ‚ÄòBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.‚Äô This instruction aimed to instill honesty in the personal lives of graduates and encourage strong nationalistic sentiment in their struggle against Japanese colonialism.
</p>
<p>
Through this education, graduates learned to prioritize the well-being of others and the nation over personal success or gain. They developed a spirit of dedication and service to benefit everyone. They also learned that righteousness meant not being trampled upon or dragged around by others but living virtuously, which is the essence of justice. Ultimately, Nam Kang‚Äôs educational direction was closely aligned with Christian values, making him a figure who actively implemented Christian education principles.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Independence movement and interfaith cooperation. In February 1911, while traveling to Seoul, he was detained by the police during an unwarranted search, as he was found carrying the business card of his cousin, Dr.&nbsp;Ahn Myeong-geun. As a result, he was exiled to Jeju Island for a year.During his exile in Jeju, Lee Seung-hun continued to promote Christian values, new education, and a new spirit among the local residents, initiating educational and cultural activities.
</p>
<p>
However, Japan used the pretext of the 105-People Incident to return him to Seoul, where he was arrested once again. Japan detained many individuals under various pretexts to weaken anti-Japanese forces within Korea, and the Ahn Myeong-geun‚Äôs unrelated school incident and the 105-Men Incident were part of these efforts.In this instance, Lee Seung- hun was falsely accused of being the mastermind behind the 105-People Incident and endured severe torture, ultimately receiving a ten-year prison sentence along with five others. Reflecting on this period, Nam Kang later said, ‚ÄòAlthough physically weakened during the five years from my escape from Jeju Island to my release, I deepened my faith through Bible study and spiritual growth.‚Äô
</p>
<p>
In February 1915, after escaping from prison, Lee Seung- hun received baptism and enrolled in Pyongyang Theological Seminary. In 1917, at the age of 54, he became one of the few elders in the church at the time and became a spiritual leader for many people. While in prison, he gathered people who had been scattered and, with Nam Kang at the center, engaged in national and modernization movements. They also constructed new buildings for Osan School and worked towards progressive education. Furthermore, he established connections with numerous leaders abroad and, from his position within the country, played a role in planning Korea‚Äôs liberation and independence movement.
</p>
<p>
In the year of the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919, representatives from different religious backgrounds, including Lee Seung- hun from the Christian side, signed a declaration of independence that had been prepared through a 33-person agreement. On March 1st, at 1:30 PM, they read the declaration at Taehwagwan Hall and proceeded to participate in the demonstration by shouting ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô at Pagoda Park. Lee Seung- hun served as a central figure in planning and coordinating this movement and was arrested along with other ethnic representatives before the ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô chants echoed. Among the representatives, Nam Kang received the harshest sentence, a three-year prison term, marking his third imprisonment. Meanwhile, as a pretext for eradicating the center of the independence movement, Japan razed and closed down Osan School and its buildings in late March of the same year.
</p>
<p>
On July 21, Lee Seung- hun, the last among the 48 individuals, including the 33 signatories of the Declaration of Independence and 15 others involved, escaped from the Kyungsung police station. Despite his increasingly weakened physical condition, he continued to lead his followers and, the following year, alongside figures like Yi Sang-jae and Yu Jin-tae, founded the Korean Education Association, continuing to advance his mission in guiding education throughout the country.

Pro-Christian leader 2

ÏïàÏ∞ΩÌò∏ Ahn Chang-ho&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
What is the leader‚Äôs commonly used Romanized name? Please use the form: surname, first name [example: Sun, Zhongshan]
</p>
<p>
Ahn Chang-ho
</p>
<p>
Please summarize the key contributions for Christianity the leader made during this decade.
</p>
<p>
Due to the 105-People Incident, numerous participants in the anti-Japanese Christian movements in the northwestern region, particularly the majority of Sinminhoe members, were imprisoned. During this time, Ahn Chang-ho focused on strengthening the competency of the Korean people to regain independence. In contrast, Lee Si-yeong, Lee Dong-hui, and Kim Chwa-jin headed to Manchuria, Russia, and Gando, respectively, to continue pursuing the militant notion of independence.
</p>
<p>
A Christian leader of the Korean immigrant community. Ahn Chang-ho played a crucial role in leading the Korean immigrant community in the U.S. and its independence movement. He established the United Korean Association (Gong-lip-Hyup-hoe) and published the Gong-lip-sin-bo, which was the first Korean newspaper in the U.S. While continuing to work on an orange farm in Riverside, California, a city known for its affluence per capita in the early 1900s (source: https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/04/27/uncovering-buried-past-early-korean-american-history-riverside), Ahn reported the assassination of Durham White Stevens (1851-1908) by Jan In-hwan. He also founded a labor union for Korean workers arriving from Korea, Hawaii, San Francisco, and other regions. Ahn introduced the church to Korean immigrants and collaborated with local churches and Christian organizations to facilitate educational programs.
</p>
<p>
In Riverside, 18 Korean laborers initially formed a public association, which later expanded to include 35 members. Ahn Chang-ho actively engaged in efforts to send these members to church. He visited nearby churches, met with pastors, and eventually chose to attend a Presbyterian church where he connected with a pastor he admired. Ahn Chang-ho requested this pastor to provide a volunteer teacher for the Pachappa Camp. Following a Sunday sermon, the pastor called for volunteers, and eleven individuals willingly stepped forward. Additionally, Ahn Chang-ho met with teachers and selected some among them (source: Ju, 1999, p.&nbsp;47, recited in Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;56).
</p>
<p>
Ahn emphasized the significance of unity among Koreans and coined the phrase ‚Äúpicking one orange in the U.S. saves the nation.‚Äù He utilized the church as a means to foster this unity. When he returned to the U.S. in 1911, he made efforts to address misunderstandings among Korean immigrants regarding the role of the church in Korea. While many intellectuals in Korea abandoned their faith during the annexation period, Ahn remained steadfast in his faith and emphasized the positive aspects of the church in Korea.
</p>
<p>
He countered claims that all Christians in Korea had fallen under Japanese influence, asserting that those with the strongest patriotic spirit could be found within the church. These individuals dedicated themselves to the cause of rebuilding the nation, as they were the ones who had lost their country and were now striving to regain it. Some members of the church had become subjects of Japan, but they were not originally church members or elders. They were individuals manipulated by the Japanese to secretly undergo baptism to gather intelligence about the church‚Äôs internal affairs. Although they outwardly participated in hymns and prayers, they could not be considered genuine Christians. Ahn argued that Japan might have been ahead in political and material civilization but could never match Korea‚Äôs spiritual and moral civilization. He emphasized that church members worked tirelessly for the sake of their fellow countrymen, and their patriotism was unwavering (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p.&nbsp;204, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;60).
</p>
<p>
Ahn further stressed the Christian mission and used questions and answers to train members of Heung-sa-dan (Youth Training Group) later on. As a leader, he prayed for Korean immigrants and took actions to spread information about the illegal suppression of the March 1st movement by the Japanese government. He emphasized that, under God‚Äôs divine command, they must continue forward, either through death or independence. He called for preparations to raise public awareness through newspapers and magazines and sought to widely publicize the tragic plight of Korean prisoners within the religious community. He requested prayers on their behalf and aimed to inform people across the United States about the situation in Korea, hoping to garner sympathy that would support their future efforts. He made a special plea to diplomats and compatriots in the United States (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p.&nbsp;903, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;64).
</p>
<p>
Developing an organizational network of the independence movement in the U.S. and provisioning the democratic republican form of government. Ahn was one of the founders of Shinminhoe and member of Seobukhakhoe whichcreated several patriotic enlightenment organizations in Korea and the U.S. The ultimate goal of the Shinminhoe was to establish a modern nation-state based on the principles of national sovereignty. Ahn Chang-ho presented a new goal for the modern nationalist movement, emphasizing the construction of a new Republic of Korea rather than the protection of the collapsing Korean Empire. At a time when the independence fighters and patriotic organizations were not considering abandoning the monarchy, the concept of a democratic republic was innovative. It also proposed a method for organizing and preparing for independence war in a systematic manner. Upon returning to the United States in 1911, Ahn Chang-ho established the Korean National Association and developed concrete plans for the independence movement within the Korean-American community. As depicted in the figure below, these plans were presented in five stages: (1) Foundation, (2) Preparation, (3) Full Preparation, (4) Progress Results, and (5) Full Results.
</p>
<p>
The Foundation stage aimed to train young individuals with strong character traits such as sincerity, courage, and patience, instilling in them a sense of moral values. They were to be trained to unite firmly under the principles of unity of purpose, division of tasks, and coordinated action, with the goal of nurturing leadership figures who would guide the nationalist movement.
</p>
<p>
The Preparation stage involved the leaders produced in the Foundation stage establishing academic and vocational groups to prepare talent and resources in various fields. Academic groups were organizations that carried out activities related to academic studies, such as collective mathematics through communication or specialized education through school education. Vocational groups focused on organizing companies for agriculture, commerce, and industry, as well as establishing financial and transportation institutions to enhance the economic power of individuals.
</p>
<p>
Full Preparation was the stage where talents from various sectors were being cultivated through the activities of academic and vocational groups, and the required finances were secured. This stage aimed to ensure the availability of specialized professionals, including military commanders, politicians, technocrats, doctors, entrepreneurs, and scholars, to prepare for the future independence war. Additionally, it involved accumulating military, construction, and diplomatic funds.
</p>
<p>
Progress Results marked the point when the independence war against Japan was finally carried out, simultaneously establishing a national government that represented the entire Korean people.

</p>
<p>
Full Results involved the post-independence phase, where after defeating Japan through the independence war and regaining sovereignty, efforts were made to build a civilized and prosperous independent nation (Heungsadan, 2012)
</p>
<p>
In 1913, upon the establishment of the Heungsadan, a system was created that utilized the term ‚ÄòGod‚Äô and employed Christian-style catechisms for membership. Just as Christianity had expanded its influence through numerous denominations and churches, Ahn Chang-ho emphasized the need for organizational strength in the Korean nationalist movement, including the Heungsadan movement. During this time, he played a significant role in nurturing and engaging the Korean community in California.
</p>
<p>
In 1915, he visited Honolulu to help resolve conflicts within the Korean National Association of Hawaii. In 1917-18, he embarked on a tour to visit Korean immigrants in various parts of Mexico. In 1918, serving as the Chairman of the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association, he sent a recommendation letter to Korean compatriots in North America, Hawaii, and Mexico, urging unity. After the conclusion of World War I, he also took a leading role in sending Korean representatives to the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations, furthering the cause of Korea‚Äôs representation on the global stage.

During the March 1st Movement, at the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association in San Francisco, a speech titled ‚ÄúInheriting the March 1st Movement‚Äù was delivered with the following message: ‚ÄúUnder God‚Äôs divine command, we will continue forward, even if it means death or independence‚Äîthese are the two paths we will follow. ‚Ä¶We must now prepare ourselves and widely spread our message, using newspapers and magazines to stir public opinion and urging the religious community to pray for Korea‚Äôs current situation on our behalf.‚Äù (Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;64)

Independence movement fund-raising. After founding the Shinminhoe in 1907, Ahn Chang-ho established a branch of the Asia Industrial Company in Vladivostok in 1908. At that time, Vladivostok was seen as a convenient hub for communication with Korea, and it allowed for collaboration with Korean expatriates residing in Russia and China to form organizations. With the establishment of the Korean National Association, Ahn Chang-ho devised a system for raising funds for the long-term independence movement. This system became known as the ‚ÄúNational Duty Fund.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
This fund was used to publish a Korean-American newspaper called ‚ÄúShinhan Minbo,‚Äù establish churches, worship halls, and schools, and provide support for the independence movement. It also led to the creation of financial laws and regulations. This fund played a significant role in maintaining the Korean National Association in Hawaii and regional assemblies in North America. It continued for over 30 years.
</p>
<p>
This system is significant because it aimed to transform individuals into citizens and establish the concept of a duty-based monetary contribution. It laid the groundwork for long-term preparations for the independence movement.

Ï°∞ÎßåÏãù Cho Man-sik
</p>
<p>
When Cho Man-sik turned fourteen, he opened a general store called Baekmok Sangjeom on Pyongyang‚Äôs Jongno Street. The Pyongyang market was one of the three major markets during the Joseon Dynasty, along with Ganggyeong Market and Daegu Market. During this time, he earned a substantial amount of money and developed a reputation as someone who enjoyed drinking and spent money wisely.
</p>
<p>
In 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, prompting Cho to suspend his business and lead his family to seek refuge in the village of Beokdoji-ri on the middle reaches of the Daedong River. He was 22 years old at the time. While in exile, Cho attended a church in his friend Han Jeong-gyo‚Äôs guidance. Upon returning to Pyongyang, he continued attending church, following his friend to Jangdaehyun Church.
</p>
<p>
Jangdaehyun Church, initially known as Neoldarigol Church, was first established by missionary Samuel Moffett and later completed as a church building, eventually being renamed Jangdaehyun Church. During his time at Jangdaehyun Church, Cho decided to leave his business of eight years to focus on his studies.
</p>
<p>
Convincing his parents, Cho entered Sungsil Middle School at the late age of 22 in 1905. Sungsil Middle School had its origins in October 10, 1897, when American Presbyterian missionary W. M. Baird began gathering students at his home in Sinyang-ri, Pyongyang, which served as the prototype. The school was formally established as a Christian institution with the construction of its school building in 1901, funded by missionary William Swallen.
</p>
<p>
Upon enrolling in Sungsil School, Cho struggled with alcohol and tobacco addiction but gradually overcame these habits in the same year as he deepened his understanding of Christianity. He lived a disciplined life thereafter, strongly influenced by the teachings of Reverend W. M. Baird and Chinese teacher Park Ja-jung, both of whom inspired him with their guidance.
</p>
<p>
After graduating from Sungsil School in 1908, Cho immediately left for Japan to study. Until 1910, he studied English and mathematics at the Jeongchik English School. During his time in Japan, he was deeply moved by the writings of Mahatma Gandhi, who was striving for India‚Äôs independence. He sympathized with Gandhi‚Äôs philosophy of nonviolent resistance and adopted it as the cornerstone of his own lifelong struggle for Korean independence. This is why he came to be known as the ‚ÄúKorean Gandhi.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Tokyo church and support for Korean students in Japan and their independence movement. In 1910, Cho graduated from the Jeongchik English School and enrolled in the specialized law department of Meiji Law College. He actively participated in the Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA) and served as the president of the Christian Youth Association in Tokyo. After witnessing the division between Presbyterian and Methodist churches in worship, he reorganized them into a unified church, allowing Korean students to worship together.The pioneers of the ‚ÄòMother‚Äô church, the Tokyo Church, which was the cradle of independence activists, were Christian independence activists themselves. Kim Jeong-sik, originally an activist in the Independence Association, converted to Christianity after the outbreak of the March 1st Movement and became a key figure in establishing the Hwangseong Christian Youth Association, attending Yeondong Church. Cho Man-sik, who embraced Christianity before enrolling in Pyongyang‚Äôs Suksil Middle School, dedicated himself to the independence movement in his homeland after studying in Japan and played a crucial role in the fostering of an independent spirit. Following Kim Jeong-sik, Baek Nam-hoon assumed the position of the second secretary-general of the Joseon Christian Youth Association in Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
Initially, Tokyo Church, which held its worship services at the Joseon Christian Youth Association building in Tokyo, had congregants who were primarily from the Presbyterian tradition and started as a Presbyterian church. However, after 1910, there was an increase in congregants who were of Methodist background. They requested the establishment of a Methodist church in Tokyo to their home country. During their stay in Japan, they decided to put denominational differences aside and proposed establishing a joint church for worship. Consequently, starting from 1911, the church changed its name to ‚ÄòKorea-Japan Tokyo United Christian Church‚Äô and conducted united worship services. This ecumenical collaborative effort between the two denominations continued as they alternated between sending ministers from the Presbyterian and Methodist traditions, setting an example of ecumenical cooperation that is still respected today.
</p>
<p>
Many members of the Tokyo Church who chose to study in Japan with the hope of someday restoring their homeland played a significant role in the independence movement. Particularly, prominent figures like Baek Nam-hoon, Yun Chang-seok, Choi Pal-yong, and Jeon Yeong-taek, who led the 1919 ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence,‚Äô were all young members of the Tokyo Church. Their unwavering dedication and sacrifices in achieving the ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence‚Äô served as a catalyst for the March 1st Movement and conveyed Korea‚Äôs determination for independence to the global community.
</p>
<p>
He urged, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not ask about our hometowns,‚Äù and joined forces with Song Jin-woo from Jeolla Province and Ahn Jae-hong from Gyeonggi Province to unify Korean student associations in Tokyo. Later, the Korean student associations in Tokyo played a foundational role in the 2.8 Declaration of Independence, a movement by Korean students studying in Japan for Korea‚Äôs independence.
</p>
<p>
Independence Movement and Educating the Next Generation. In March 1931, at the age of 31, Cho graduated from Meiji University and returned to Korea. He took up a teaching position at Osan School, established by Yi Seung-hoon, who had initiated the enlightenment movement in Pyeonganbuk-do Province‚Äôs Jeongju. At the time, Yi Seung-hoon had been imprisoned in the 105-person incident, and the school faced challenges.
</p>
<p>
In 1919, Cho joined the March 1st Movement, leaving his position as the principal of Osan School. While in exile in Shanghai, he was pursued by Japanese military police in Gangdong, Pyeongannam-do Province, and was arrested. He spent a year in Pyongyang Prison. After his release from Pyongyang Prison, Cho returned to Osan School to work as the principal again. In 1921, he became the general secretary of the YMCA Youth Council and was appointed as an elder in the Sanjeonghyun Church, which had branched out from Jangdaehyun Church.

</p>
<p>
Syngman Rhee learned English and entered the school operated by American Methodist missionaries, called Paichai Hakdang, with the aim of earning a substantial income. During his time there, he encountered Christian faith and Western learning. Additionally, he actively participated in the Independence Association and political reform movements. As a result, in 1899, the Independence Association disbanded, and he became implicated in the ‚ÄúPark Yeong-hyo Coup Plot,‚Äù leading to his imprisonment. Facing a death sentence, he recalled the sermons he had heard during his time at Paichai Hakdang and began reading the Bible and praying, ultimately converting to Christianity.
</p>
<p>
He became involved in the Korean language movement, writing while in prison, and developed a Christian theory of nation-building. After converting to Christianity, he wrote about his thoughts on Christianity, drawing from the Christian books he had read. His outlined strategy for the Korean church included (1) self-growth, (2) self-sustainability, (3) self-governance, and (4) unification with a spirit of unification added to Neviareus‚Äôs three principles. His vision was to establish and maintain a church that wouldn‚Äôt be dominated by other nations but would be built and sustained by the strength of Koreans, where the equality of God would be practiced.

<p>
Songjuk Suicide SquadÏÜ°Ï£ΩÍ≤∞ÏÇ¨ÎåÄ
</p>
<p>
Please summarize some key contributions this organization made for Christianity during this decade.
</p>
<p>
After the 1907 National Debt Repayment Movement, organized anti-Japanese women‚Äôs movements were scarce. Capable men engaged in social activities established independence bases in places like Manchuria, China, and actively conducted armed independence movements. They also organized secret organizations within the country, maintaining close contact and support with overseas independence bases. However, it was not an easy task for women. Women had to engage in individual or small-scale acts of spiritual resistance until the opportunity for a massive independence struggle arose. They resisted Japan‚Äôs shallow attempts to take away Korea‚Äôs entire territory and attempted to pacify Koreans with meager consolation funds. They also passively resisted attempts to employ Korean women as domestic servants due to extreme poverty caused by Japanese economic exploitation.
</p>
<p>
Particularly, modern-educated female students formed secret societies with like-minded friends, organizing them into secret societies with different names to prepare for emergencies even after graduation. In 1913, three central figures, Hwang Esther, Kim Kyung-hee, and Park Jeong-seok, organized the Songjuk Secret Society (Songjuk Gyeolsa-dae) as a notable example.
</p>
<p>
At that time, Songjuk Secret Society expanded its activities nationally through careful planning. Hwang Esther primarily operated in Seoul, Kim Kyung-hee continued her activities at Sungshil Girls‚Äô School, and Park Jeong-seok was active in the church. They expanded the organization nationwide while keeping it secret. Songjuk Secret Society was named for its secretive nature. They were careful about accepting new members and followed strict regulations. A member needed a recommendation from an existing member, and unanimous approval was required for membership.
</p>
<p>
The organization had both a secure middle-aged group and an active young group, which were referred to as the ‚ÄúSong Brothers‚Äù and ‚ÄúJuk Brothers,‚Äù respectively. Their activities gradually expanded, and they even included Korean expatriates in Hawaii as members.
</p>
<p>
The declaration of independence by Korean students in Japan did not only end there; it also had an influence within the country. The ‚Äú2.8 Declaration of Independence‚Äù by Korean students in Tokyo could be aptly described as the magnificent ‚Äúoverture‚Äù of the March 1st Movement (Kang Deok-sang, Vol. 26, p.&nbsp;18).
</p>
<p>
During that time, there were a significant number of female students studying in Tokyo. Korean female students in Tokyo organized the ‚ÄúTokyo Women‚Äôs Friendship Society‚Äù and were actively engaged in various activities, even publishing their own magazine called ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs World‚Äù (Â•≥Â≠êÁïå). The president of this organization was Kim Maria, who was studying at a women‚Äôs school in Tokyo. Kim Maria was a devout elder of the Korean Presbyterian Church, hailing from Sorae Church, the first modern Korean church in Hwanghae Province. She had also graduated from Seoul‚Äôs Jungshin Women‚Äôs School. While Kim Maria didn‚Äôt directly participate in the activities of the ‚ÄúKorean Youth Independence Association,‚Äù which was promoting the independence declaration, she made a significant contribution to the birth of the February 8th Declaration of Independence by combining funds from the Women‚Äôs Friendship Society members and her own resources to support the activities of the Korean Youth Independence Association (Chosun Military Police Headquarters, 1969, p.&nbsp;24).
</p>
<p>
In order to convey this information to Korea, Kim Maria, along with Hwang Esther, secretly brought a copy of the independence declaration from Tokyo, concealing it within her kimono sash, and arrived in Busan in mid-February. In Busan, she met her third aunt, Kim Sun-ae, and her first uncle-in-law, Seo Byeong-ho, both of whom were on a secret mission to publicize the independence movement in Shanghai. They exchanged news about the independence movement in Shanghai and the independence declaration in Tokyo. Kim Maria met with figures in the religious and patriotic communities in Busan, showed them the ‚ÄúFebruary 8th Declaration of Independence‚Äù that she had concealed in her sash, and encouraged them to actively participate in the independence movement. She then traveled to Daegu, where she met with local religious and community leaders, urging them to support the independence movement. Afterward, she moved to Gwangju, where she met with her sister, Kim Ham-ra, and her brother-in-law, Nam Gung-hyeok, both of whom were patriotic activists, to convey news of the independence movement in Shanghai and Tokyo and promote the independence movement in Gwangju before heading to Seoul.
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving in Seoul, Kim Maria reunited with Hwang Esther. They met with teachers and graduates of Christian women‚Äôs schools to introduce overseas independence activities and discuss plans for domestic independence activities. They also met with figures from the social elite, including Kim Seong-su, Song Jin-woo, and Lee Jong-il, to discuss the independence movement. Lee Jong-il, the head of the Cheondogyo printing office, left a recollection of his meeting with Kim Maria as follows (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p.&nbsp;186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMaria Kim came to the Cheondogyo headquarters and Bosongsa and enthusiastically introduced the fact that, with the patriotic fervor of Korean male and female students overseas, they had declared independence. She made great efforts to encourage us to continue the movement even in our home country. I told Maria Kim that we had already been planning and quietly searching for ways to rise up together with the people since the year 1914, and she was delighted to hear about the grand ideology of Cheondogyo.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In addition to the activities of their seniors, Christian women‚Äôs school students were secretly preparing for independence through groups like the ‚ÄúKorean Christian Students‚Äô Association‚Äù (YMCA), which were linked to students in Tokyo and Shanghai. Even before the March 1st Movement, Christian female students were preparing for independence through their own secret organizations. In Seoul, Ewha Hakdang was used as a gathering place, communication hub, and distribution center for declarations and statements by female students in the city. The diary of one of these female students provides insight into the preparations and activities they undertook (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p.&nbsp;186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFor two months, we made various preparations. We collected addresses of our fellow students, secured finances, and discreetly organized our comrades. Sometimes, we would arrange secret meetings by placing a wooden plank in front of a well and hiding underneath it, exchanging just a few words. On the morning of March 1st, without distinguishing between children and adults, we would go one by one and tell them what needed to be done today.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In a Confucian-based patriarchal society, it was almost unimaginable for women to form their own organizations, let alone participate in social organizations. However, as described above, Christian women like Kim Maria and Hwang Esther were not merely joining the independence movement but were focused on organizing and leading the independence movement independently by women‚Äôs own strength. They aimed to empower women to be active contributors to the nation‚Äôs independence struggle, not just passive participants, as reflected in the name ‚Äúnational‚Äù in the movement‚Äôs title. Additionally, Christian female students, who were still in school, were actively participating in the independence movement through their own determination and efforts.

Million Soul Movement.
<p></p>
<p>
Following the revivals in Wonsan in 1903 and Pyongyang in 1907, the ‚ÄúMillion Souls Movement‚Äù that unfolded in 1909 and 1910 was an effort by the Korean church to revitalize and grow. If the spiritual awakening seen in Wonsan and later in Pyongyang could be considered the workings of the Holy Spirit, the Million Souls Movement that unfolded over two years was, as the name suggests, a missionary movement aimed at evangelizing the nation.
</p>
<p>
It began with the goal of converting one million believers. While the general history of the revival that started in January 1907 lasted for about six months, it significantly weakened, particularly for the Presbyterian Church in March 1907 and the Methodist Church in April 1907, during the Cheongju and Gongju Conventions, respectively. In light of this reality, it was in the spirit of continuing the flames of revival by spreading them through missionary activities that six missionary boards, including the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches, jointly pursued the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
While there are differing views on the origins of this movement, it is generally known that American Methodist missionaries in the southern region, including F. K. Gamble, C. F. Reid, and M. B. Stokes, began praying for the revival of the Korean church in July 1909 in Songdo, Gyeonggi Province, which led to their inspiration for evangelism and revival. They started praying for the salvation of fifty thousand souls in their mission areas and, in September of the same year, during the Southern Methodist Church Convention held in Songdo, they set a goal to evangelize ‚Äútwo hundred thousand souls for Christ,‚Äù which later became the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
The Presbyterian Church also responded to this initiative. Pastor Kil Sun-joo, who served at Jangdaehyeon Church, conceived the idea of a large-scale evangelistic campaign upon his return to Pyongyang after completing a tour of the Amnokgang River coast in 1908. He proposed the idea of a church-wide evangelistic campaign while starting a morning prayer meeting at Jangdaehyeon Church and, in 1910, was appointed as vice-chairman and director of the Evangelism Department at the Fourth Donghak Society Congress, allowing him to implement this movement more concretely.
</p>
<p>
In summary, after experiencing the revival in Pyongyang, various attempts were made to rekindle this revival. These efforts, fueled by a desire for a new revival and national evangelization, coalesced into the Million Souls Movement in 1909. However, it was primarily promoted by Methodist missionaries, with the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches deciding to advance it as a church-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the General Council of Evangelical Missions in Korea, which convened in Seoul on October 8th and 9th, 1909, officially adopted the slogan ‚ÄúA Million Souls for Christ,‚Äù which had been adopted during the Southern Methodist Church Convention. They resolved to implement this movement nationwide and set a target period of one year until October 9, 1910, praying for abundant results.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the Christian population in Korea was less than 200,000, making the goal of converting one million believers seem overly ambitious. Nevertheless, the intention behind it was clear: one million believers would be enough to save the nation, safeguard its autonomy, and achieve independence. During this period, a prayer campaign took place, known as ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which symbolized the dedication of Korean Christians to the cause of evangelism. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù During the Million Souls Movement, Korean Christians pledged a total of 100,000 days of day offering. In Pyongyang alone, over a thousand Christians committed to dedicating 22,000 days to day offering. During this period, a prayer movement also emerged, with Friday night prayer meetings following Wednesday prayer meetings. In retrospect, this Friday night prayer movement can be seen as the precursor to the modern Friday Night Prayer Vigil.
</p>
<p>
In terms of results, the Million Souls Movement did not achieve its intended success. The number of actual converts fell far short of the proclaimed goal. Political factors, such as increasing pressure from Japan and the forced annexation of Korea in 1910, likely played a significant role in its lack of success. In fact, the Japanese authorities considered the Million Souls Movement a political activity by Koreans and interfered with the rallies. Additionally, the movement was unable to garner voluntary participation and mobilization of Koreans, despite being spearheaded by missionaries. Nevertheless, the dream of national evangelization and gospelization was a noble one.
</p>
<p>
During the Million Souls Movement, the dedication of Korean Christians was symbolized by ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which involved offering one‚Äôs daily life in a manner similar to offering material possessions. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù Missionaries including Gale served as chairman, with Underwood, Hugh Miller, and D. A. Bunker as members, to oversee the implementation of this movement. While the Million Souls Movement was essentially an interdenominational evangelistic campaign, it was primarily promoted by missionaries in Korea. The movement operated on two fronts:
</p>
<p>
First, there were mass evangelistic rallies. These rallies were held in various regions, including Seoul, and foreign revival preachers who happened to visit Korea at that time participated in these events. Well-known American revivalist pastors like J. Wilbur Chapman and gospel singer Charles M. Alexander held evangelistic rallies in Seoul and major cities. Robert Harkness, a member of the evangelistic team and a composer, wrote and popularized the hymn ‚ÄúTo a Million Souls for Jesus.‚Äù George T. B. Davis, among others, also participated in this effort. Many rallies were organized around these figures.
</p>
<p>
Second, there was house-to-house evangelism known as ‚ÄúChukho‚Äù (ÈÄêÊà∂) evangelism and day-offering. Evangelists visited homes, schools, and other places, distributing individual copies of the Gospel and tracts. During the Million Souls Movement, approximately 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark were distributed, along with around three million tracts. One of the most distinctive evangelistic methods during the Million Souls Movement was the distribution of a vast number of tracts and copies of the Gospel of Mark through a practice known as ‚ÄúDay Offering.‚Äù The term ‚ÄúDay Offering‚Äù referred to dedicating one‚Äôs time to the cause of evangelism, separate from material offerings. This movement received significant enthusiasm among believers, with around a thousand Christians in Pyongyang alone dedicating 22,000 days to Day Offering, and 10,000 days dedicated in the area of Jeryeong, Hwanghae Province. It is reported that over 100,000 days were dedicated nationwide. In regard to this Day Offering, the following passage was published in English in the monthly magazine ‚ÄòThe Korea Mission Field‚Äô:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDespite their hard and impoverished lives, the Korean people devoted a total of over 100,000 days to the evangelistic campaign. The number of days used last winter was 76,000, and this fall, hundreds of evangelists, along with student workers who went from house to house and leaders who attended large gatherings, dedicated an entire month. They distributed 3 million tracts, and believers, paying for them themselves, purchased 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark to distribute freely to their unbelieving compatriots, along with earnest recommendations and fervent prayers for them to read the Gospels and believe in Jesus. There were hardly any Korean households that did not receive visits for house-to-house evangelism. To obtain results in house-to-house evangelism, thousands of Koreans prayed daily.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Third, The First YMCA Student Evangelical Conference. Among the numerous gatherings held during the Million Souls Movement, one that stood out for its fervent passion for national evangelization was the YMCA Student Evangelical Conference, which attracted young university students. It took place from June 22nd to 27th, 1910, at the ancient temple of Jingwansa, located in the northern part of Seoul. Prominent missionaries like Underwood, Lee Sang-jae, Kim Gyu-sik, Kil Sun-joo, Evison, and Watson, along with Korean leaders, served as instructors and inspired young students with hope and visions for their nation. Religions joined forces in the face of Japanese aggression. Monks offered their rooms to students, and instead of chanting and the sound of wooden fish, hymns and prayers echoed throughout the temple.
</p>
<p>
Although it was a small-scale conference with 46 students representing ten universities, it was a precious gathering aimed at training outstanding students in a situation where the nation‚Äôs sovereignty had been taken away due to the Korea-Japan merger, with the hope of illuminating the nation‚Äôs future.
</p>
<p>
In the morning, there were Bible study sessions and special lectures led by missionaries. In the afternoons, various team-building sports activities were conducted. During the nighttime sessions, passionate lectures by teachers Lee Sang-jae and Kim Gyu-sik, who were deeply committed to Christian nationalism, were enough to ignite a fire in the hearts of the students. Participants made fervent commitments for the sake of their country and the church.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, While the numerical growth was limited compared to the efforts expended during the Daebu Revival or the Pyongyang Great Revival, it can be said that almost every village, even in remote areas, had some exposure to the Gospel. Missionaries and churches worked diligently with a sense of unity. It played a unifying role in harnessing the energy of the nation during one of the most challenging periods in its history. In a time of national despair, it offered hope and contributed to the spread of the belief that ‚ÄúChristianity is the hope of the nation.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ecumenical Movement
</p>
<p>
On March 26, 1918, with the aim of effectively advancing their shared goal of Korean mission work, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church came together to establish the ‚ÄúKorean Joint Council of the Presbyterian and Methodist Missions.‚Äù Their collaboration extended across various areas, encompassing mission field allocation, Bible translation, medical missions, educational missions, mission publications, newspaper publications, hymnal publications, Sunday school initiatives, joint publishing endeavors, and document-based missions.
</p>
<p>
In pursuit of cooperative mission work, they took significant steps: in 1887, they founded the Bible Translation Committee; in 1890, the First Front Christian Publishing Society; and in 1905, the Union General Assembly of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches. There was even a movement to establish a single national church. However, the realization of a national church was hindered by several factors:
</p>
<p>
Individual denominations had already established their own systems.
</p>
<p>
The headquarters of these denominations, located in various countries, did not provide unified support for their respective missionaries and churches in Korea.
</p>
<p>
There was no strong governing entity, such as the government, to facilitate cooperation between major religions and pseudo-religions. As a result, the establishment of a national church remained elusive.

Please summarize the key contributions for Christianity the leader made during this decade.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
His contribution is characterized national advancement movement through educating the next-generation. Lee was born in the lower class but succeeded on his own business. During the Sino-Japanese war, his business went broke and went into retreat at his hometown in 1905 when the Joseon-Japan treat was established. Josen lost its diplomatic rights and Lee joined Seo-woo-Hak-hoe which was a youth enlightenment and literacy campaign organization in Northwest region (Pyongan)of Korea. In 1907 when the Hague Secret Emissary Agency failed to declare the invalidity of Japanese diplomatic maneuvers and Gojong was impeached by Japan, Lee listened to Ahn Chang-ho‚Äôs salvation of nation speech about protecting the national rights in Pyongyang.
</p>
<p>
Seung-hoon, having heard about Ahn Chang-ho for some time, decided to go and listen to his speech. When he arrived, he found a gathering of people, and at the center of it all was a passionate young man in his thirties dressed in a suit, addressing the crowd. He spoke about the state of the world, how Western civilization was using its power to influence the East, and how Japan, after learning from its experiences in the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars, was determined to absorb our country with the approval of the United Kingdom. He emphasized that to preserve our homeland with its 4,000 years of history, we must discard all the bad habits of the past and prioritize education, uniting the people to become something new. (Ham, 1988, p.&nbsp;31, recited in Kim, 2014, p.&nbsp;61).
</p>
<p>
There were two directions were facilitated in the Korean society to salvage the nation. One direction was armed independence campaign and the other was enlightenment and literacy campaign. Establishment of school and educating the youth was training the elite scholar military who will save the nation in the foreseeable future. In 1907, he founded Osan school at the Hyanggyo, Confucian institute, at Jeongju, Pyongan province. In 1910, he converted into Christians influenced by the great revival movement in Pyongyang and other North Korea regions. Lee listened to Han Seok-jin‚Äôs semon who was one of the first graduates from the Pyongyang theological seminary. Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross was interpreted as Korean people‚Äôs difficulties to survive and believed that Christianity which emphasizes love, service, and devotion was a way to unite Koreans.

<p>
<strong>Framing Christian Education.</strong> He returned to school, gathered the staff and students, and made a commitment to believe in Jesus Christ, deciding to hold religious gatherings at the school. He believed that the Christian spirit emphasizing dedication, service, and love could be the catalyst for the entire nation to regain strength and unity. Consequently, in December of that year, he changed the school‚Äôs educational leader based on Christian beliefs, appointing Pastor Slacy L. Robert as the principal and began teaching Bible studies. Later on, Teacher Yu Yeong-mo and Teacher Jo Man-sik, who would become principals, played crucial roles in establishing a strong foundation for faith education at Osan School. Although, in November 1923, due to the Japanese Education Decree of 1922, the Christian educational leadership was removed, and the school became a general institution, the atmosphere of religious gatherings and prayer continued within the school. It is said that hymns echoed through the school morning and evening, fostering a sense of camaraderie among colleagues.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
On the other hand, Nam Kang based his education on Christian values, making reverence, love, and sincerity (Êï¨ÊÑõË™†) the purpose of education. This involved respecting God and teachers (Êï¨), loving the nation and the country (ÊÑõ), and cultivating students who live truthfully and sincerely without falsehood (Ë™†). This educational purpose aligns with Osan School‚Äôs motto of ‚ÄòLove, Sincerity, and Respect.‚Äô His emphasis on righteousness (Áæ©) in education is well-reflected in Christian principles. He taught students to prioritize faith in their education, rejecting falsehood, laziness, selfishness, and cunning, and instead, always acting, learning, and living with a noble purpose. Nam Kang often quoted the Bible in his teachings, emphasizing, ‚ÄòBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.‚Äô This instruction aimed to instill honesty in the personal lives of graduates and encourage strong nationalistic sentiment in their struggle against Japanese colonialism.
</p>
<p>
Through this education, graduates learned to prioritize the well-being of others and the nation over personal success or gain. They developed a spirit of dedication and service to benefit everyone. They also learned that righteousness meant not being trampled upon or dragged around by others but living virtuously, which is the essence of justice. Ultimately, Nam Kang‚Äôs educational direction was closely aligned with Christian values, making him a figure who actively implemented Christian education principles.‚Äù

<strong>Independence movement and interfaith cooperation</strong>. In February 1911, while traveling to Seoul, he was detained by the police during an unwarranted search, as he was found carrying the business card of his cousin, Dr.&nbsp;Ahn Myeong-geun. As a result, he was exiled to Jeju Island for a year.During his exile in Jeju, Lee Seung-hun continued to promote Christian values, new education, and a new spirit among the local residents, initiating educational and cultural activities.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
However, Japan used the pretext of the 105-People Incident to return him to Seoul, where he was arrested once again. Japan detained many individuals under various pretexts to weaken anti-Japanese forces within Korea, and the Ahn Myeong-geun‚Äôs unrelated school incident and the 105-Men Incident were part of these efforts.In this instance, Lee Seung- hun was falsely accused of being the mastermind behind the 105-People Incident and endured severe torture, ultimately receiving a ten-year prison sentence along with five others. Reflecting on this period, Nam Kang later said, ‚ÄòAlthough physically weakened during the five years from my escape from Jeju Island to my release, I deepened my faith through Bible study and spiritual growth.‚Äô
</p>
<p>
In February 1915, after escaping from prison, Lee Seung- hun received baptism and enrolled in Pyongyang Theological Seminary. In 1917, at the age of 54, he became one of the few elders in the church at the time and became a spiritual leader for many people. While in prison, he gathered people who had been scattered and, with Nam Kang at the center, engaged in national and modernization movements. They also constructed new buildings for Osan School and worked towards progressive education. Furthermore, he established connections with numerous leaders abroad and, from his position within the country, played a role in planning Korea‚Äôs liberation and independence movement.
</p>
<p>
In the year of the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919, representatives from different religious backgrounds, including Lee Seung- hun from the Christian side, signed a declaration of independence that had been prepared through a 33-person agreement. On March 1st, at 1:30 PM, they read the declaration at Taehwagwan Hall and proceeded to participate in the demonstration by shouting ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô at Pagoda Park. Lee Seung- hun served as a central figure in planning and coordinating this movement and was arrested along with other ethnic representatives before the ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô chants echoed. Among the representatives, Nam Kang received the harshest sentence, a three-year prison term, marking his third imprisonment. Meanwhile, as a pretext for eradicating the center of the independence movement, Japan razed and closed down Osan School and its buildings in late March of the same year.
</p>
<p>
On July 21, Lee Seung- hun, the last among the 48 individuals, including the 33 signatories of the Declaration of Independence and 15 others involved, escaped from the Kyungsung police station. Despite his increasingly weakened physical condition, he continued to lead his followers and, the following year, alongside figures like Yi Sang-jae and Yu Jin-tae, founded the Korean Education Association, continuing to advance his mission in guiding education throughout the country.

Due to the 105-People Incident, numerous participants in the anti-Japanese Christian movements in the northwestern region, particularly the majority of Sinminhoe members, were imprisoned. During this time, Ahn Chang-ho focused on strengthening the competency of the Korean people to regain independence. In contrast, Lee Si-yeong, Lee Dong-hui, and Kim Chwa-jin headed to Manchuria, Russia, and Gando, respectively, to continue pursuing the militant notion of independence.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
<strong>A Christian leader of the Korean immigrant community</strong>. Ahn Chang-ho played a crucial role in leading the Korean immigrant community in the U.S. and its independence movement. He established the United Korean Association (Gong-lip-Hyup-hoe) and published the Gong-lip-sin-bo, which was the first Korean newspaper in the U.S. While continuing to work on an orange farm in Riverside, California, a city known for its affluence per capita in the early 1900s (source: https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/04/27/uncovering-buried-past-early-korean-american-history-riverside), Ahn reported the assassination of Durham White Stevens (1851-1908) by Jan In-hwan. He also founded a labor union for Korean workers arriving from Korea, Hawaii, San Francisco, and other regions. Ahn introduced the church to Korean immigrants and collaborated with local churches and Christian organizations to facilitate educational programs.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
In Riverside, <mark>18 Korean laborers</mark> initially formed a public association, which later expanded to include 35 members. Ahn Chang-ho actively engaged in efforts to send these members to church. He visited nearby churches, met with pastors, and eventually chose to attend a Presbyterian church where he connected with a pastor he admired. Ahn Chang-ho requested this pastor to provide a volunteer teacher for the Pachappa Camp. Following a Sunday sermon, the pastor called for volunteers, and eleven individuals willingly stepped forward. Additionally, Ahn Chang-ho met with teachers and selected some among them (source: Ju, 1999, p.&nbsp;47, recited in Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;56).
</p>
<p>
Ahn emphasized the significance of unity among Koreans and coined the phrase ‚Äúpicking one orange in the U.S. saves the nation.‚Äù He utilized the church as a means to foster this unity. When he returned to the U.S. in 1911, he made efforts to address misunderstandings among Korean immigrants regarding the role of the church in Korea. While many intellectuals in Korea abandoned their faith during the annexation period, Ahn remained steadfast in his faith and emphasized the positive aspects of the church in Korea.
</p>
<p>
He countered claims that all Christians in Korea had fallen under Japanese influence, asserting that those with the strongest patriotic spirit could be found within the church. These individuals dedicated themselves to the cause of rebuilding the nation, as they were the ones who had lost their country and were now striving to regain it. Some members of the church had become subjects of Japan, but they were not originally church members or elders. They were individuals manipulated by the Japanese to secretly undergo baptism to gather intelligence about the church‚Äôs internal affairs. Although they outwardly participated in hymns and prayers, they could not be considered genuine Christians. Ahn argued that Japan might have been ahead in political and material civilization but could never match Korea‚Äôs spiritual and moral civilization. He emphasized that church members worked tirelessly for the sake of their fellow countrymen, and their patriotism was unwavering (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p.&nbsp;204, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;60).
</p>
<p>
Ahn further stressed the Christian mission and used questions and answers to train members of <em>Heung-sa-dan</em> (Youth Training Group) later on. As a leader, he prayed for Korean immigrants and took actions to spread information about the illegal suppression of the March 1st movement by the Japanese government. He emphasized that, under God‚Äôs divine command, they must continue forward, either through death or independence. He called for preparations to raise public awareness through newspapers and magazines and sought to widely publicize the tragic plight of Korean prisoners within the religious community. He requested prayers on their behalf and aimed to inform people across the United States about the situation in Korea, hoping to garner sympathy that would support their future efforts. He made a special plea to diplomats and compatriots in the United States (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p. 903, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;64).

<p>
<strong>Developing an organizational network of the independence movement in the U.S. and provisioning the democratic republican form of government.</strong> Ahn was one of the founders of Shinminhoe and member of Seobukhakhoe whichcreated several patriotic enlightenment organizations in Korea and the U.S. The ultimate goal of the Shinminhoe was to establish a modern nation-state based on the principles of national sovereignty. Ahn Chang-ho presented a new goal for the modern nationalist movement, emphasizing the construction of a new Republic of Korea rather than the protection of the collapsing Korean Empire. At a time when the independence fighters and patriotic organizations were not considering abandoning the monarchy, the concept of a democratic republic was innovative. It also proposed a method for organizing and preparing for independence war in a systematic manner. Upon returning to the United States in 1911, Ahn Chang-ho established the Korean National Association and developed concrete plans for the independence movement within the Korean-American community. As depicted in the figure below, these plans were presented in five stages: (1) Foundation, (2) Preparation, (3) Full Preparation, (4) Progress Results, and (5) Full Results.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
The Foundation stage aimed to train young individuals with strong character traits such as sincerity, courage, and patience, instilling in them a sense of moral values. They were to be trained to unite firmly under the principles of unity of purpose, division of tasks, and coordinated action, with the goal of nurturing leadership figures who would guide the nationalist movement.
</p>
<p>
The Preparation stage involved the leaders produced in the Foundation stage establishing academic and vocational groups to prepare talent and resources in various fields. Academic groups were organizations that carried out activities related to academic studies, such as collective mathematics through communication or specialized education through school education. Vocational groups focused on organizing companies for agriculture, commerce, and industry, as well as establishing financial and transportation institutions to enhance the economic power of individuals.
</p>
<p>
Full Preparation was the stage where talents from various sectors were being cultivated through the activities of academic and vocational groups, and the required finances were secured. This stage aimed to ensure the availability of specialized professionals, including military commanders, politicians, technocrats, doctors, entrepreneurs, and scholars, to prepare for the future independence war. Additionally, it involved accumulating military, construction, and diplomatic funds.
</p>
<p>
Progress Results marked the point when the independence war against Japan was finally carried out, simultaneously establishing a national government that represented the entire Korean people.

</p>
<p>
Full Results involved the post-independence phase, where after defeating Japan through the independence war and regaining sovereignty, efforts were made to build a civilized and prosperous independent nation (Heungsadan, 2012)
</p>
<p>
In 1913, upon the establishment of the Heungsadan, a system was created that utilized the term ‚ÄòGod‚Äô and employed Christian-style catechisms for membership. Just as Christianity had expanded its influence through numerous denominations and churches, Ahn Chang-ho emphasized the need for organizational strength in the Korean nationalist movement, including the Heungsadan movement. During this time, he played a significant role in nurturing and engaging the Korean community in California.
</p>
<p>
In 1915, he visited Honolulu to help resolve conflicts within the Korean National Association of Hawaii. In 1917-18, he embarked on a tour to visit Korean immigrants in various parts of Mexico. In 1918, serving as the Chairman of the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association, he sent a recommendation letter to Korean compatriots in North America, Hawaii, and Mexico, urging unity. After the conclusion of World War I, he also took a leading role in sending Korean representatives to the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations, furthering the cause of Korea‚Äôs representation on the global stage.
</p>
<p>
During the March 1st Movement, at the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association in San Francisco, a speech titled ‚ÄúInheriting the March 1st Movement‚Äù was delivered with the following message: ‚ÄúUnder God‚Äôs divine command, we will continue forward, even if it means death or independence‚Äîthese are the two paths we will follow. ‚Ä¶We must now prepare ourselves and widely spread our message, using newspapers and magazines to stir public opinion and urging the religious community to pray for Korea‚Äôs current situation on our behalf.‚Äù (Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;64)
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">

<p>
<strong>Independence movement fund-raising.</strong> After founding the Shinminhoe in 1907, Ahn Chang-ho established a branch of the Asia Industrial Company in Vladivostok in 1908. At that time, Vladivostok was seen as a convenient hub for communication with Korea, and it allowed for collaboration with Korean expatriates residing in Russia and China to form organizations. With the establishment of the Korean National Association, Ahn Chang-ho devised a system for raising funds for the long-term independence movement. This system became known as the ‚ÄúNational Duty Fund.‚Äù
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
This fund was used to publish a Korean-American newspaper called ‚ÄúShinhan Minbo,‚Äù establish churches, worship halls, and schools, and provide support for the independence movement. It also led to the creation of financial laws and regulations. This fund played a significant role in maintaining the Korean National Association in Hawaii and regional assemblies in North America. It continued for over 30 years.
</p>
<p>
This system is significant because it aimed to transform individuals into citizens and establish the concept of a duty-based monetary contribution. It laid the groundwork for long-term preparations for the independence movement.

<p>
<strong>Ï°∞ÎßåÏãù Cho Man-sik</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Cho Man-sik turned fourteen, he opened a general store called Baekmok Sangjeom on Pyongyang‚Äôs Jongno Street. The Pyongyang market was one of the three major markets during the Joseon Dynasty, along with Ganggyeong Market and Daegu Market. During this time, he earned a substantial amount of money and developed a reputation as someone who enjoyed drinking and spent money wisely.
</p>
<p>
In 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, prompting Cho to suspend his business and lead his family to seek refuge in the village of Beokdoji-ri on the middle reaches of the Daedong River. He was 22 years old at the time. While in exile, Cho attended a church in his friend Han Jeong-gyo‚Äôs guidance. Upon returning to Pyongyang, he continued attending church, following his friend to Jangdaehyun Church.
</p>
<p>
Jangdaehyun Church, initially known as Neoldarigol Church, was first established by missionary Samuel Moffett and later completed as a church building, eventually being renamed Jangdaehyun Church. During his time at Jangdaehyun Church, Cho decided to leave his business of eight years to focus on his studies.
</p>
<p>
Convincing his parents, Cho entered Sungsil Middle School at the late age of 22 in 1905. Sungsil Middle School had its origins in October 10, 1897, when American Presbyterian missionary W. M. Baird began gathering students at his home in Sinyang-ri, Pyongyang, which served as the prototype. The school was formally established as a Christian institution with the construction of its school building in 1901, funded by missionary William Swallen.
</p>
<p>
Upon enrolling in Sungsil School, Cho struggled with alcohol and tobacco addiction but gradually overcame these habits in the same year as he deepened his understanding of Christianity. He lived a disciplined life thereafter, strongly influenced by the teachings of Reverend W. M. Baird and Chinese teacher Park Ja-jung, both of whom inspired him with their guidance.
</p>
<p>
After graduating from Sungsil School in 1908, Cho immediately left for Japan to study. Until 1910, he studied English and mathematics at the Jeongchik English School. During his time in Japan, he was deeply moved by the writings of Mahatma Gandhi, who was striving for India‚Äôs independence. He sympathized with Gandhi‚Äôs philosophy of nonviolent resistance and adopted it as the cornerstone of his own lifelong struggle for Korean independence. This is why he came to be known as the ‚ÄúKorean Gandhi.‚Äù

<p>
<strong>Tokyo church and support for Korean students in Japan and their independence movement.</strong> In 1910, Cho graduated from the Jeongchik English School and enrolled in the specialized law department of Meiji Law College. He actively participated in the Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA) and served as the president of the Christian Youth Association in Tokyo. After witnessing the division between Presbyterian and Methodist churches in worship, he reorganized them into a unified church, allowing Korean students to worship together.<br> <br> The pioneers of the ‚ÄòMother‚Äô church, the Tokyo Church, which was the cradle of independence activists, were Christian independence activists themselves. Kim Jeong-sik, originally an activist in the Independence Association, converted to Christianity after the outbreak of the March 1st Movement and became a key figure in establishing the Hwangseong Christian Youth Association, attending Yeondong Church. Cho Man-sik, who embraced Christianity before enrolling in Pyongyang‚Äôs Suksil Middle School, dedicated himself to the independence movement in his homeland after studying in Japan and played a crucial role in the fostering of an independent spirit. Following Kim Jeong-sik, Baek Nam-hoon assumed the position of the second secretary-general of the Joseon Christian Youth Association in Tokyo.
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
Initially, Tokyo Church, which held its worship services at the Joseon Christian Youth Association building in Tokyo, had congregants who were primarily from the Presbyterian tradition and started as a Presbyterian church. However, after 1910, there was an increase in congregants who were of Methodist background. They requested the establishment of a Methodist church in Tokyo to their home country. During their stay in Japan, they decided to put denominational differences aside and proposed establishing a joint church for worship. Consequently, starting from 1911, the church changed its name to ‚ÄòKorea-Japan Tokyo United Christian Church‚Äô and conducted united worship services. This ecumenical collaborative effort between the two denominations continued as they alternated between sending ministers from the Presbyterian and Methodist traditions, setting an example of ecumenical cooperation that is still respected today.
</p>
<p>
Many members of the Tokyo Church who chose to study in Japan with the hope of someday restoring their homeland played a significant role in the independence movement. Particularly, prominent figures like Baek Nam-hoon, Yun Chang-seok, Choi Pal-yong, and Jeon Yeong-taek, who led the 1919 ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence,‚Äô were all young members of the Tokyo Church. Their unwavering dedication and sacrifices in achieving the ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence‚Äô served as a catalyst for the March 1st Movement and conveyed Korea‚Äôs determination for independence to the global community.
</p>
<p>
He urged, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not ask about our hometowns,‚Äù and joined forces with Song Jin-woo from Jeolla Province and Ahn Jae-hong from Gyeonggi Province to unify Korean student associations in Tokyo. Later, the Korean student associations in Tokyo played a foundational role in the 2.8 Declaration of Independence, a movement by Korean students studying in Japan for Korea‚Äôs independence.

<strong>Independence Movement and Educating the Next Generation</strong>. In March 1931, at the age of 31, Cho graduated from Meiji University and returned to Korea. He took up a teaching position at Osan School, established by Yi Seung-hoon, who had initiated the enlightenment movement in Pyeonganbuk-do Province‚Äôs Jeongju. At the time, Yi Seung-hoon had been imprisoned in the 105-person incident, and the school faced challenges.

In 1919, Cho joined the March 1st Movement, leaving his position as the principal of Osan School. While in exile in Shanghai, he was pursued by Japanese military police in Gangdong, Pyeongannam-do Province, and was arrested. He spent a year in Pyongyang Prison. After his release from Pyongyang Prison, Cho returned to Osan School to work as the principal again. In 1921, he became the general secretary of the YMCA Youth Council and was appointed as an elder in the Sanjeonghyun Church, which had branched out from Jangdaehyun Church.

</p>
<p>
Syngman Rhee learned English and entered the school operated by American Methodist missionaries, called Paichai Hakdang, with the aim of earning a substantial income. During his time there, he encountered Christian faith and Western learning. Additionally, he actively participated in the Independence Association and political reform movements. As a result, in 1899, the Independence Association disbanded, and he became implicated in the ‚ÄúPark Yeong-hyo Coup Plot,‚Äù leading to his imprisonment. Facing a death sentence, he recalled the sermons he had heard during his time at Paichai Hakdang and began reading the Bible and praying, ultimately converting to Christianity.
</p>
<p>
He became involved in the Korean language movement, writing while in prison, and developed a Christian theory of nation-building. After converting to Christianity, he wrote about his thoughts on Christianity, drawing from the Christian books he had read. His outlined strategy for the Korean church included (1) self-growth, (2) self-sustainability, (3) self-governance, and (4) unification with a spirit of unification added to Neviareus‚Äôs three principles. His vision was to establish and maintain a church that wouldn‚Äôt be dominated by other nations but would be built and sustained by the strength of Koreans, where the equality of God would be practiced.

Please summarize some key contributions this organization made for Christianity during this decade.
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
After the 1907 National Debt Repayment Movement, organized anti-Japanese women‚Äôs movements were scarce. Capable men engaged in social activities established independence bases in places like Manchuria, China, and actively conducted armed independence movements. They also organized secret organizations within the country, maintaining close contact and support with overseas independence bases. However, it was not an easy task for women. Women had to engage in individual or small-scale acts of spiritual resistance until the opportunity for a massive independence struggle arose. They resisted Japan‚Äôs shallow attempts to take away Korea‚Äôs entire territory and attempted to pacify Koreans with meager consolation funds. They also passively resisted attempts to employ Korean women as domestic servants due to extreme poverty caused by Japanese economic exploitation.
</p>
<p>
Particularly, modern-educated female students formed secret societies with like-minded friends, organizing them into secret societies with different names to prepare for emergencies even after graduation. In 1913, three central figures, Hwang Esther, Kim Kyung-hee, and Park Jeong-seok, organized the Songjuk Secret Society (Songjuk Gyeolsa-dae) as a notable example.
</p>
<p>
At that time, Songjuk Secret Society expanded its activities nationally through careful planning. Hwang Esther primarily operated in Seoul, Kim Kyung-hee continued her activities at Sungshil Girls‚Äô School, and Park Jeong-seok was active in the church. They expanded the organization nationwide while keeping it secret. Songjuk Secret Society was named for its secretive nature. They were careful about accepting new members and followed strict regulations. A member needed a recommendation from an existing member, and unanimous approval was required for membership.
</p>
<p>
The organization had both a secure middle-aged group and an active young group, which were referred to as the ‚ÄúSong Brothers‚Äù and ‚ÄúJuk Brothers,‚Äù respectively. Their activities gradually expanded, and they even included Korean expatriates in Hawaii as members.
</p>
<p>
The declaration of independence by Korean students in Japan did not only end there; it also had an influence within the country. The ‚Äú2.8 Declaration of Independence‚Äù by Korean students in Tokyo could be aptly described as the magnificent ‚Äúoverture‚Äù of the March 1st Movement (Kang Deok-sang, Vol. 26, p.&nbsp;18).
</p>
<p>
During that time, there were a significant number of female students studying in Tokyo. Korean female students in Tokyo organized the ‚ÄúTokyo Women‚Äôs Friendship Society‚Äù and were actively engaged in various activities, even publishing their own magazine called ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs World‚Äù (Â•≥Â≠êÁïå). The president of this organization was Kim Maria, who was studying at a women‚Äôs school in Tokyo. Kim Maria was a devout elder of the Korean Presbyterian Church, hailing from Sorae Church, the first modern Korean church in Hwanghae Province. She had also graduated from Seoul‚Äôs Jungshin Women‚Äôs School. While Kim Maria didn‚Äôt directly participate in the activities of the ‚ÄúKorean Youth Independence Association,‚Äù which was promoting the independence declaration, she made a significant contribution to the birth of the February 8th Declaration of Independence by combining funds from the Women‚Äôs Friendship Society members and her own resources to support the activities of the Korean Youth Independence Association (Chosun Military Police Headquarters, 1969, p.&nbsp;24).
</p>
<p>
In order to convey this information to Korea, Kim Maria, along with Hwang Esther, secretly brought a copy of the independence declaration from Tokyo, concealing it within her kimono sash, and arrived in Busan in mid-February. In Busan, she met her third aunt, Kim Sun-ae, and her first uncle-in-law, Seo Byeong-ho, both of whom were on a secret mission to publicize the independence movement in Shanghai. They exchanged news about the independence movement in Shanghai and the independence declaration in Tokyo. Kim Maria met with figures in the religious and patriotic communities in Busan, showed them the ‚ÄúFebruary 8th Declaration of Independence‚Äù that she had concealed in her sash, and encouraged them to actively participate in the independence movement. She then traveled to Daegu, where she met with local religious and community leaders, urging them to support the independence movement. Afterward, she moved to Gwangju, where she met with her sister, Kim Ham-ra, and her brother-in-law, Nam Gung-hyeok, both of whom were patriotic activists, to convey news of the independence movement in Shanghai and Tokyo and promote the independence movement in Gwangju before heading to Seoul.
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving in Seoul, Kim Maria reunited with Hwang Esther. They met with teachers and graduates of Christian women‚Äôs schools to introduce overseas independence activities and discuss plans for domestic independence activities. They also met with figures from the social elite, including Kim Seong-su, Song Jin-woo, and Lee Jong-il, to discuss the independence movement. Lee Jong-il, the head of the Cheondogyo printing office, left a recollection of his meeting with Kim Maria as follows (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p.&nbsp;186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMaria Kim came to the Cheondogyo headquarters and Bosongsa and enthusiastically introduced the fact that, with the patriotic fervor of Korean male and female students overseas, they had declared independence. She made great efforts to encourage us to continue the movement even in our home country. I told Maria Kim that we had already been planning and quietly searching for ways to rise up together with the people since the year 1914, and she was delighted to hear about the grand ideology of Cheondogyo.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In addition to the activities of their seniors, Christian women‚Äôs school students were secretly preparing for independence through groups like the ‚ÄúKorean Christian Students‚Äô Association‚Äù (YMCA), which were linked to students in Tokyo and Shanghai. Even before the March 1st Movement, Christian female students were preparing for independence through their own secret organizations. In Seoul, Ewha Hakdang was used as a gathering place, communication hub, and distribution center for declarations and statements by female students in the city. The diary of one of these female students provides insight into the preparations and activities they undertook (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p. 186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFor two months, we made various preparations. We collected addresses of our fellow students, secured finances, and discreetly organized our comrades. Sometimes, we would arrange secret meetings by placing a wooden plank in front of a well and hiding underneath it, exchanging just a few words. On the morning of March 1st, without distinguishing between children and adults, we would go one by one and tell them what needed to be done today.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In a Confucian-based patriarchal society, it was almost unimaginable for women to form their own organizations, let alone participate in social organizations. However, as described above, Christian women like Kim Maria and Hwang Esther were not merely joining the independence movement but were focused on organizing and leading the independence movement independently by women‚Äôs own strength. They aimed to empower women to be active contributors to the nation‚Äôs independence struggle, not just passive participants, as reflected in the name ‚Äúnational‚Äù in the movement‚Äôs title. Additionally, Christian female students, who were still in school, were actively participating in the independence movement through their own determination and efforts.

<strong>Million Soul Movement.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Following the revivals in Wonsan in 1903 and Pyongyang in 1907, the ‚ÄúMillion Souls Movement‚Äù that unfolded in 1909 and 1910 was an effort by the Korean church to revitalize and grow. If the spiritual awakening seen in Wonsan and later in Pyongyang could be considered the workings of the Holy Spirit, the Million Souls Movement that unfolded over two years was, as the name suggests, a missionary movement aimed at evangelizing the nation.
</p>
<p>
It began with the goal of converting one million believers. While the general history of the revival that started in January 1907 lasted for about six months, it significantly weakened, particularly for the Presbyterian Church in March 1907 and the Methodist Church in April 1907, during the Cheongju and Gongju Conventions, respectively. In light of this reality, it was in the spirit of continuing the flames of revival by spreading them through missionary activities that six missionary boards, including the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches, jointly pursued the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
While there are differing views on the origins of this movement, it is generally known that American Methodist missionaries in the southern region, including F. K. Gamble, C. F. Reid, and M. B. Stokes, began praying for the revival of the Korean church in July 1909 in Songdo, Gyeonggi Province, which led to their inspiration for evangelism and revival. They started praying for the salvation of fifty thousand souls in their mission areas and, in September of the same year, during the Southern Methodist Church Convention held in Songdo, they set a goal to evangelize ‚Äútwo hundred thousand souls for Christ,‚Äù which later became the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
The Presbyterian Church also responded to this initiative. Pastor Kil Sun-joo, who served at Jangdaehyeon Church, conceived the idea of a large-scale evangelistic campaign upon his return to Pyongyang after completing a tour of the Amnokgang River coast in 1908. He proposed the idea of a church-wide evangelistic campaign while starting a morning prayer meeting at Jangdaehyeon Church and, in 1910, was appointed as vice-chairman and director of the Evangelism Department at the Fourth Donghak Society Congress, allowing him to implement this movement more concretely.
</p>
<p>
In summary, after experiencing the revival in Pyongyang, various attempts were made to rekindle this revival. These efforts, fueled by a desire for a new revival and national evangelization, coalesced into the Million Souls Movement in 1909. However, it was primarily promoted by Methodist missionaries, with the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches deciding to advance it as a church-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the General Council of Evangelical Missions in Korea, which convened in Seoul on October 8th and 9th, 1909, officially adopted the slogan ‚ÄúA Million Souls for Christ,‚Äù which had been adopted during the Southern Methodist Church Convention. They resolved to implement this movement nationwide and set a target period of one year until October 9, 1910, praying for abundant results.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the Christian population in Korea was less than 200,000, making the goal of converting one million believers seem overly ambitious. Nevertheless, the intention behind it was clear: one million believers would be enough to save the nation, safeguard its autonomy, and achieve independence. During this period, a prayer campaign took place, known as ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which symbolized the dedication of Korean Christians to the cause of evangelism. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù During the Million Souls Movement, Korean Christians pledged a total of 100,000 days of day offering. In Pyongyang alone, over a thousand Christians committed to dedicating 22,000 days to day offering. During this period, a prayer movement also emerged, with Friday night prayer meetings following Wednesday prayer meetings. In retrospect, this Friday night prayer movement can be seen as the precursor to the modern Friday Night Prayer Vigil.
</p>
<p>
In terms of results, the Million Souls Movement did not achieve its intended success. The number of actual converts fell far short of the proclaimed goal. Political factors, such as increasing pressure from Japan and the forced annexation of Korea in 1910, likely played a significant role in its lack of success. In fact, the Japanese authorities considered the Million Souls Movement a political activity by Koreans and interfered with the rallies. Additionally, the movement was unable to garner voluntary participation and mobilization of Koreans, despite being spearheaded by missionaries. Nevertheless, the dream of national evangelization and gospelization was a noble one.
</p>
<p>
During the Million Souls Movement, the dedication of Korean Christians was symbolized by ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which involved offering one‚Äôs daily life in a manner similar to offering material possessions. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù Missionaries including Gale served as chairman, with Underwood, Hugh Miller, and D. A. Bunker as members, to oversee the implementation of this movement. While the Million Souls Movement was essentially an interdenominational evangelistic campaign, it was primarily promoted by missionaries in Korea. The movement operated on two fronts:
</p>
<p>
First, there were mass evangelistic rallies. These rallies were held in various regions, including Seoul, and foreign revival preachers who happened to visit Korea at that time participated in these events. Well-known American revivalist pastors like J. Wilbur Chapman and gospel singer Charles M. Alexander held evangelistic rallies in Seoul and major cities. Robert Harkness, a member of the evangelistic team and a composer, wrote and popularized the hymn ‚ÄúTo a Million Souls for Jesus.‚Äù George T. B. Davis, among others, also participated in this effort. Many rallies were organized around these figures.
</p>
<p>
Second, there was house-to-house evangelism known as ‚ÄúChukho‚Äù (ÈÄêÊà∂) evangelism and day-offering. Evangelists visited homes, schools, and other places, distributing individual copies of the Gospel and tracts. During the Million Souls Movement, approximately 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark were distributed, along with around three million tracts. One of the most distinctive evangelistic methods during the Million Souls Movement was the distribution of a vast number of tracts and copies of the Gospel of Mark through a practice known as ‚ÄúDay Offering.‚Äù The term ‚ÄúDay Offering‚Äù referred to dedicating one‚Äôs time to the cause of evangelism, separate from material offerings. This movement received significant enthusiasm among believers, with around a thousand Christians in Pyongyang alone dedicating 22,000 days to Day Offering, and 10,000 days dedicated in the area of Jeryeong, Hwanghae Province. It is reported that over 100,000 days were dedicated nationwide. In regard to this Day Offering, the following passage was published in English in the monthly magazine ‚ÄòThe Korea Mission Field‚Äô:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDespite their hard and impoverished lives, the Korean people devoted a total of over 100,000 days to the evangelistic campaign. The number of days used last winter was 76,000, and this fall, hundreds of evangelists, along with student workers who went from house to house and leaders who attended large gatherings, dedicated an entire month. They distributed 3 million tracts, and believers, paying for them themselves, purchased 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark to distribute freely to their unbelieving compatriots, along with earnest recommendations and fervent prayers for them to read the Gospels and believe in Jesus. There were hardly any Korean households that did not receive visits for house-to-house evangelism. To obtain results in house-to-house evangelism, thousands of Koreans prayed daily.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Third, The First YMCA Student Evangelical Conference. Among the numerous gatherings held during the Million Souls Movement, one that stood out for its fervent passion for national evangelization was the YMCA Student Evangelical Conference, which attracted young university students. It took place from June 22nd to 27th, 1910, at the ancient temple of Jingwansa, located in the northern part of Seoul. Prominent missionaries like Underwood, Lee Sang-jae, Kim Gyu-sik, Kil Sun-joo, Evison, and Watson, along with Korean leaders, served as instructors and inspired young students with hope and visions for their nation. Religions joined forces in the face of Japanese aggression. Monks offered their rooms to students, and instead of chanting and the sound of wooden fish, hymns and prayers echoed throughout the temple.
</p>
<p>
Although it was a small-scale conference with 46 students representing ten universities, it was a precious gathering aimed at training outstanding students in a situation where the nation‚Äôs sovereignty had been taken away due to the Korea-Japan merger, with the hope of illuminating the nation‚Äôs future.
</p>
<p>
In the morning, there were Bible study sessions and special lectures led by missionaries. In the afternoons, various team-building sports activities were conducted. During the nighttime sessions, passionate lectures by teachers Lee Sang-jae and Kim Gyu-sik, who were deeply committed to Christian nationalism, were enough to ignite a fire in the hearts of the students. Participants made fervent commitments for the sake of their country and the church.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, While the numerical growth was limited compared to the efforts expended during the Daebu Revival or the Pyongyang Great Revival, it can be said that almost every village, even in remote areas, had some exposure to the Gospel. Missionaries and churches worked diligently with a sense of unity. It played a unifying role in harnessing the energy of the nation during one of the most challenging periods in its history. In a time of national despair, it offered hope and contributed to the spread of the belief that ‚ÄúChristianity is the hope of the nation.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ecumenical Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
On March 26, 1918, with the aim of effectively advancing their shared goal of Korean mission work, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church came together to establish the ‚ÄúKorean Joint Council of the Presbyterian and Methodist Missions.‚Äù Their collaboration extended across various areas, encompassing mission field allocation, Bible translation, medical missions, educational missions, mission publications, newspaper publications, hymnal publications, Sunday school initiatives, joint publishing endeavors, and document-based missions.
</p>
<p>
In pursuit of cooperative mission work, they took significant steps: in 1887, they founded the Bible Translation Committee; in 1890, the First Front Christian Publishing Society; and in 1905, the Union General Assembly of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches. There was even a movement to establish a single national church. However, the realization of a national church was hindered by several factors:
</p>
<p>
Individual denominations had already established their own systems.
</p>
<p>
The headquarters of these denominations, located in various countries, did not provide unified support for their respective missionaries and churches in Korea.
</p>
<p>
There was no strong governing entity, such as the government, to facilitate cooperation between major religions and pseudo-religions. As a result, the establishment of a national church remained elusive.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
His contribution is characterized national advancement movement through educating the next-generation. Lee was born in the lower class but succeeded on his own business. During the Sino-Japanese war, his business went broke and went into retreat at his hometown in 1905 when the Joseon-Japan treat was established. Josen lost its diplomatic rights and Lee joined Seo-woo-Hak-hoe which was a youth enlightenment and literacy campaign organization in Northwest region (Pyongan)of Korea. In 1907 when the Hague Secret Emissary Agency failed to declare the invalidity of Japanese diplomatic maneuvers and Gojong was impeached by Japan, Lee listened to Ahn Chang-ho‚Äôs salvation of nation speech about protecting the national rights in Pyongyang.
</p>
<p>
Seung-hoon, having heard about Ahn Chang-ho for some time, decided to go and listen to his speech. When he arrived, he found a gathering of people, and at the center of it all was a passionate young man in his thirties dressed in a suit, addressing the crowd. He spoke about the state of the world, how Western civilization was using its power to influence the East, and how Japan, after learning from its experiences in the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars, was determined to absorb our country with the approval of the United Kingdom. He emphasized that to preserve our homeland with its 4,000 years of history, we must discard all the bad habits of the past and prioritize education, uniting the people to become something new. (Ham, 1988, p.&nbsp;31, recited in Kim, 2014, p.&nbsp;61).
</p>
<p>
There were two directions were facilitated in the Korean society to salvage the nation. One direction was armed independence campaign and the other was enlightenment and literacy campaign. Establishment of school and educating the youth was training the elite scholar military who will save the nation in the foreseeable future. In 1907, he founded Osan school at the Hyanggyo, Confucian institute, at Jeongju, Pyongan province. In 1910, he converted into Christians influenced by the great revival movement in Pyongyang and other North Korea regions. Lee listened to Han Seok-jin‚Äôs semon who was one of the first graduates from the Pyongyang theological seminary. Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross was interpreted as Korean people‚Äôs difficulties to survive and believed that Christianity which emphasizes love, service, and devotion was a way to unite Koreans.
</p>

<ol type="1">

<p>
<strong>Framing Christian Education.</strong> He returned to school, gathered the staff and students, and made a commitment to believe in Jesus Christ, deciding to hold religious gatherings at the school. He believed that the Christian spirit emphasizing dedication, service, and love could be the catalyst for the entire nation to regain strength and unity. Consequently, in December of that year, he changed the school‚Äôs educational leader based on Christian beliefs, appointing Pastor Slacy L. Robert as the principal and began teaching Bible studies. Later on, Teacher Yu Yeong-mo and Teacher Jo Man-sik, who would become principals, played crucial roles in establishing a strong foundation for faith education at Osan School. Although, in November 1923, due to the Japanese Education Decree of 1922, the Christian educational leadership was removed, and the school became a general institution, the atmosphere of religious gatherings and prayer continued within the school. It is said that hymns echoed through the school morning and evening, fostering a sense of camaraderie among colleagues.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
On the other hand, Nam Kang based his education on Christian values, making reverence, love, and sincerity (Êï¨ÊÑõË™†) the purpose of education. This involved respecting God and teachers (Êï¨), loving the nation and the country (ÊÑõ), and cultivating students who live truthfully and sincerely without falsehood (Ë™†). This educational purpose aligns with Osan School‚Äôs motto of ‚ÄòLove, Sincerity, and Respect.‚Äô His emphasis on righteousness (Áæ©) in education is well-reflected in Christian principles. He taught students to prioritize faith in their education, rejecting falsehood, laziness, selfishness, and cunning, and instead, always acting, learning, and living with a noble purpose. Nam Kang often quoted the Bible in his teachings, emphasizing, ‚ÄòBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.‚Äô This instruction aimed to instill honesty in the personal lives of graduates and encourage strong nationalistic sentiment in their struggle against Japanese colonialism.
</p>
<p>
Through this education, graduates learned to prioritize the well-being of others and the nation over personal success or gain. They developed a spirit of dedication and service to benefit everyone. They also learned that righteousness meant not being trampled upon or dragged around by others but living virtuously, which is the essence of justice. Ultimately, Nam Kang‚Äôs educational direction was closely aligned with Christian values, making him a figure who actively implemented Christian education principles.‚Äù

<strong>Independence movement and interfaith cooperation</strong>. In February 1911, while traveling to Seoul, he was detained by the police during an unwarranted search, as he was found carrying the business card of his cousin, Dr.&nbsp;Ahn Myeong-geun. As a result, he was exiled to Jeju Island for a year.During his exile in Jeju, Lee Seung-hun continued to promote Christian values, new education, and a new spirit among the local residents, initiating educational and cultural activities.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
However, Japan used the pretext of the 105-People Incident to return him to Seoul, where he was arrested once again. Japan detained many individuals under various pretexts to weaken anti-Japanese forces within Korea, and the Ahn Myeong-geun‚Äôs unrelated school incident and the 105-Men Incident were part of these efforts.In this instance, Lee Seung- hun was falsely accused of being the mastermind behind the 105-People Incident and endured severe torture, ultimately receiving a ten-year prison sentence along with five others. Reflecting on this period, Nam Kang later said, ‚ÄòAlthough physically weakened during the five years from my escape from Jeju Island to my release, I deepened my faith through Bible study and spiritual growth.‚Äô
</p>
<p>
In February 1915, after escaping from prison, Lee Seung- hun received baptism and enrolled in Pyongyang Theological Seminary. In 1917, at the age of 54, he became one of the few elders in the church at the time and became a spiritual leader for many people. While in prison, he gathered people who had been scattered and, with Nam Kang at the center, engaged in national and modernization movements. They also constructed new buildings for Osan School and worked towards progressive education. Furthermore, he established connections with numerous leaders abroad and, from his position within the country, played a role in planning Korea‚Äôs liberation and independence movement.
</p>
<p>
In the year of the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919, representatives from different religious backgrounds, including Lee Seung- hun from the Christian side, signed a declaration of independence that had been prepared through a 33-person agreement. On March 1st, at 1:30 PM, they read the declaration at Taehwagwan Hall and proceeded to participate in the demonstration by shouting ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô at Pagoda Park. Lee Seung- hun served as a central figure in planning and coordinating this movement and was arrested along with other ethnic representatives before the ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô chants echoed. Among the representatives, Nam Kang received the harshest sentence, a three-year prison term, marking his third imprisonment. Meanwhile, as a pretext for eradicating the center of the independence movement, Japan razed and closed down Osan School and its buildings in late March of the same year.
</p>
<p>
On July 21, Lee Seung- hun, the last among the 48 individuals, including the 33 signatories of the Declaration of Independence and 15 others involved, escaped from the Kyungsung police station. Despite his increasingly weakened physical condition, he continued to lead his followers and, the following year, alongside figures like Yi Sang-jae and Yu Jin-tae, founded the Korean Education Association, continuing to advance his mission in guiding education throughout the country.

Due to the 105-People Incident, numerous participants in the anti-Japanese Christian movements in the northwestern region, particularly the majority of Sinminhoe members, were imprisoned. During this time, Ahn Chang-ho focused on strengthening the competency of the Korean people to regain independence. In contrast, Lee Si-yeong, Lee Dong-hui, and Kim Chwa-jin headed to Manchuria, Russia, and Gando, respectively, to continue pursuing the militant notion of independence.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">

<p>
<strong>A Christian leader of the Korean immigrant community</strong>. Ahn Chang-ho played a crucial role in leading the Korean immigrant community in the U.S. and its independence movement. He established the United Korean Association (Gong-lip-Hyup-hoe) and published the Gong-lip-sin-bo, which was the first Korean newspaper in the U.S. While continuing to work on an orange farm in Riverside, California, a city known for its affluence per capita in the early 1900s (source: https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/04/27/uncovering-buried-past-early-korean-american-history-riverside), Ahn reported the assassination of Durham White Stevens (1851-1908) by Jan In-hwan. He also founded a labor union for Korean workers arriving from Korea, Hawaii, San Francisco, and other regions. Ahn introduced the church to Korean immigrants and collaborated with local churches and Christian organizations to facilitate educational programs.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
In Riverside, <mark>18 Korean laborers</mark> initially formed a public association, which later expanded to include 35 members. Ahn Chang-ho actively engaged in efforts to send these members to church. He visited nearby churches, met with pastors, and eventually chose to attend a Presbyterian church where he connected with a pastor he admired. Ahn Chang-ho requested this pastor to provide a volunteer teacher for the Pachappa Camp. Following a Sunday sermon, the pastor called for volunteers, and eleven individuals willingly stepped forward. Additionally, Ahn Chang-ho met with teachers and selected some among them (source: Ju, 1999, p.&nbsp;47, recited in Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;56).
</p>
<p>
Ahn emphasized the significance of unity among Koreans and coined the phrase ‚Äúpicking one orange in the U.S. saves the nation.‚Äù He utilized the church as a means to foster this unity. When he returned to the U.S. in 1911, he made efforts to address misunderstandings among Korean immigrants regarding the role of the church in Korea. While many intellectuals in Korea abandoned their faith during the annexation period, Ahn remained steadfast in his faith and emphasized the positive aspects of the church in Korea.
</p>
<p>
He countered claims that all Christians in Korea had fallen under Japanese influence, asserting that those with the strongest patriotic spirit could be found within the church. These individuals dedicated themselves to the cause of rebuilding the nation, as they were the ones who had lost their country and were now striving to regain it. Some members of the church had become subjects of Japan, but they were not originally church members or elders. They were individuals manipulated by the Japanese to secretly undergo baptism to gather intelligence about the church‚Äôs internal affairs. Although they outwardly participated in hymns and prayers, they could not be considered genuine Christians. Ahn argued that Japan might have been ahead in political and material civilization but could never match Korea‚Äôs spiritual and moral civilization. He emphasized that church members worked tirelessly for the sake of their fellow countrymen, and their patriotism was unwavering (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p.&nbsp;204, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;60).
</p>
<p>
Ahn further stressed the Christian mission and used questions and answers to train members of <em>Heung-sa-dan</em> (Youth Training Group) later on. As a leader, he prayed for Korean immigrants and took actions to spread information about the illegal suppression of the March 1st movement by the Japanese government. He emphasized that, under God‚Äôs divine command, they must continue forward, either through death or independence. He called for preparations to raise public awareness through newspapers and magazines and sought to widely publicize the tragic plight of Korean prisoners within the religious community. He requested prayers on their behalf and aimed to inform people across the United States about the situation in Korea, hoping to garner sympathy that would support their future efforts. He made a special plea to diplomats and compatriots in the United States (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p. 903, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;64).

<p>
<strong>Developing an organizational network of the independence movement in the U.S. and provisioning the democratic republican form of government.</strong> Ahn was one of the founders of Shinminhoe and member of Seobukhakhoe whichcreated several patriotic enlightenment organizations in Korea and the U.S. The ultimate goal of the Shinminhoe was to establish a modern nation-state based on the principles of national sovereignty. Ahn Chang-ho presented a new goal for the modern nationalist movement, emphasizing the construction of a new Republic of Korea rather than the protection of the collapsing Korean Empire. At a time when the independence fighters and patriotic organizations were not considering abandoning the monarchy, the concept of a democratic republic was innovative. It also proposed a method for organizing and preparing for independence war in a systematic manner. Upon returning to the United States in 1911, Ahn Chang-ho established the Korean National Association and developed concrete plans for the independence movement within the Korean-American community. As depicted in the figure below, these plans were presented in five stages: (1) Foundation, (2) Preparation, (3) Full Preparation, (4) Progress Results, and (5) Full Results.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
The Foundation stage aimed to train young individuals with strong character traits such as sincerity, courage, and patience, instilling in them a sense of moral values. They were to be trained to unite firmly under the principles of unity of purpose, division of tasks, and coordinated action, with the goal of nurturing leadership figures who would guide the nationalist movement.
</p>
<p>
The Preparation stage involved the leaders produced in the Foundation stage establishing academic and vocational groups to prepare talent and resources in various fields. Academic groups were organizations that carried out activities related to academic studies, such as collective mathematics through communication or specialized education through school education. Vocational groups focused on organizing companies for agriculture, commerce, and industry, as well as establishing financial and transportation institutions to enhance the economic power of individuals.
</p>
<p>
Full Preparation was the stage where talents from various sectors were being cultivated through the activities of academic and vocational groups, and the required finances were secured. This stage aimed to ensure the availability of specialized professionals, including military commanders, politicians, technocrats, doctors, entrepreneurs, and scholars, to prepare for the future independence war. Additionally, it involved accumulating military, construction, and diplomatic funds.
</p>
<p>
Progress Results marked the point when the independence war against Japan was finally carried out, simultaneously establishing a national government that represented the entire Korean people.

</p>
<p>
Full Results involved the post-independence phase, where after defeating Japan through the independence war and regaining sovereignty, efforts were made to build a civilized and prosperous independent nation (Heungsadan, 2012)
</p>
<p>
In 1913, upon the establishment of the Heungsadan, a system was created that utilized the term ‚ÄòGod‚Äô and employed Christian-style catechisms for membership. Just as Christianity had expanded its influence through numerous denominations and churches, Ahn Chang-ho emphasized the need for organizational strength in the Korean nationalist movement, including the Heungsadan movement. During this time, he played a significant role in nurturing and engaging the Korean community in California.
</p>
<p>
In 1915, he visited Honolulu to help resolve conflicts within the Korean National Association of Hawaii. In 1917-18, he embarked on a tour to visit Korean immigrants in various parts of Mexico. In 1918, serving as the Chairman of the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association, he sent a recommendation letter to Korean compatriots in North America, Hawaii, and Mexico, urging unity. After the conclusion of World War I, he also took a leading role in sending Korean representatives to the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations, furthering the cause of Korea‚Äôs representation on the global stage.
</p>
<p>
During the March 1st Movement, at the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association in San Francisco, a speech titled ‚ÄúInheriting the March 1st Movement‚Äù was delivered with the following message: ‚ÄúUnder God‚Äôs divine command, we will continue forward, even if it means death or independence‚Äîthese are the two paths we will follow. ‚Ä¶We must now prepare ourselves and widely spread our message, using newspapers and magazines to stir public opinion and urging the religious community to pray for Korea‚Äôs current situation on our behalf.‚Äù (Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;64)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Independence movement fund-raising.</strong> After founding the Shinminhoe in 1907, Ahn Chang-ho established a branch of the Asia Industrial Company in Vladivostok in 1908. At that time, Vladivostok was seen as a convenient hub for communication with Korea, and it allowed for collaboration with Korean expatriates residing in Russia and China to form organizations. With the establishment of the Korean National Association, Ahn Chang-ho devised a system for raising funds for the long-term independence movement. This system became known as the ‚ÄúNational Duty Fund.‚Äù
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
This fund was used to publish a Korean-American newspaper called ‚ÄúShinhan Minbo,‚Äù establish churches, worship halls, and schools, and provide support for the independence movement. It also led to the creation of financial laws and regulations. This fund played a significant role in maintaining the Korean National Association in Hawaii and regional assemblies in North America. It continued for over 30 years.
</p>
<p>
This system is significant because it aimed to transform individuals into citizens and establish the concept of a duty-based monetary contribution. It laid the groundwork for long-term preparations for the independence movement.

<p>
<strong>Ï°∞ÎßåÏãù Cho Man-sik</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Cho Man-sik turned fourteen, he opened a general store called Baekmok Sangjeom on Pyongyang‚Äôs Jongno Street. The Pyongyang market was one of the three major markets during the Joseon Dynasty, along with Ganggyeong Market and Daegu Market. During this time, he earned a substantial amount of money and developed a reputation as someone who enjoyed drinking and spent money wisely.
</p>
<p>
In 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, prompting Cho to suspend his business and lead his family to seek refuge in the village of Beokdoji-ri on the middle reaches of the Daedong River. He was 22 years old at the time. While in exile, Cho attended a church in his friend Han Jeong-gyo‚Äôs guidance. Upon returning to Pyongyang, he continued attending church, following his friend to Jangdaehyun Church.
</p>
<p>
Jangdaehyun Church, initially known as Neoldarigol Church, was first established by missionary Samuel Moffett and later completed as a church building, eventually being renamed Jangdaehyun Church. During his time at Jangdaehyun Church, Cho decided to leave his business of eight years to focus on his studies.
</p>
<p>
Convincing his parents, Cho entered Sungsil Middle School at the late age of 22 in 1905. Sungsil Middle School had its origins in October 10, 1897, when American Presbyterian missionary W. M. Baird began gathering students at his home in Sinyang-ri, Pyongyang, which served as the prototype. The school was formally established as a Christian institution with the construction of its school building in 1901, funded by missionary William Swallen.
</p>
<p>
Upon enrolling in Sungsil School, Cho struggled with alcohol and tobacco addiction but gradually overcame these habits in the same year as he deepened his understanding of Christianity. He lived a disciplined life thereafter, strongly influenced by the teachings of Reverend W. M. Baird and Chinese teacher Park Ja-jung, both of whom inspired him with their guidance.
</p>
<p>
After graduating from Sungsil School in 1908, Cho immediately left for Japan to study. Until 1910, he studied English and mathematics at the Jeongchik English School. During his time in Japan, he was deeply moved by the writings of Mahatma Gandhi, who was striving for India‚Äôs independence. He sympathized with Gandhi‚Äôs philosophy of nonviolent resistance and adopted it as the cornerstone of his own lifelong struggle for Korean independence. This is why he came to be known as the ‚ÄúKorean Gandhi.‚Äù
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
<strong>Tokyo church and support for Korean students in Japan and their independence movement.</strong> In 1910, Cho graduated from the Jeongchik English School and enrolled in the specialized law department of Meiji Law College. He actively participated in the Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA) and served as the president of the Christian Youth Association in Tokyo. After witnessing the division between Presbyterian and Methodist churches in worship, he reorganized them into a unified church, allowing Korean students to worship together.<br> <br> The pioneers of the ‚ÄòMother‚Äô church, the Tokyo Church, which was the cradle of independence activists, were Christian independence activists themselves. Kim Jeong-sik, originally an activist in the Independence Association, converted to Christianity after the outbreak of the March 1st Movement and became a key figure in establishing the Hwangseong Christian Youth Association, attending Yeondong Church. Cho Man-sik, who embraced Christianity before enrolling in Pyongyang‚Äôs Suksil Middle School, dedicated himself to the independence movement in his homeland after studying in Japan and played a crucial role in the fostering of an independent spirit. Following Kim Jeong-sik, Baek Nam-hoon assumed the position of the second secretary-general of the Joseon Christian Youth Association in Tokyo.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
Initially, Tokyo Church, which held its worship services at the Joseon Christian Youth Association building in Tokyo, had congregants who were primarily from the Presbyterian tradition and started as a Presbyterian church. However, after 1910, there was an increase in congregants who were of Methodist background. They requested the establishment of a Methodist church in Tokyo to their home country. During their stay in Japan, they decided to put denominational differences aside and proposed establishing a joint church for worship. Consequently, starting from 1911, the church changed its name to ‚ÄòKorea-Japan Tokyo United Christian Church‚Äô and conducted united worship services. This ecumenical collaborative effort between the two denominations continued as they alternated between sending ministers from the Presbyterian and Methodist traditions, setting an example of ecumenical cooperation that is still respected today.
</p>
<p>
Many members of the Tokyo Church who chose to study in Japan with the hope of someday restoring their homeland played a significant role in the independence movement. Particularly, prominent figures like Baek Nam-hoon, Yun Chang-seok, Choi Pal-yong, and Jeon Yeong-taek, who led the 1919 ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence,‚Äô were all young members of the Tokyo Church. Their unwavering dedication and sacrifices in achieving the ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence‚Äô served as a catalyst for the March 1st Movement and conveyed Korea‚Äôs determination for independence to the global community.
</p>
<p>
He urged, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not ask about our hometowns,‚Äù and joined forces with Song Jin-woo from Jeolla Province and Ahn Jae-hong from Gyeonggi Province to unify Korean student associations in Tokyo. Later, the Korean student associations in Tokyo played a foundational role in the 2.8 Declaration of Independence, a movement by Korean students studying in Japan for Korea‚Äôs independence.

<strong>Independence Movement and Educating the Next Generation</strong>. In March 1931, at the age of 31, Cho graduated from Meiji University and returned to Korea. He took up a teaching position at Osan School, established by Yi Seung-hoon, who had initiated the enlightenment movement in Pyeonganbuk-do Province‚Äôs Jeongju. At the time, Yi Seung-hoon had been imprisoned in the 105-person incident, and the school faced challenges.

After his release from Pyongyang Prison, Cho returned to Osan School to work as the principal again. In 1921, he became the general secretary of the YMCA Youth Council and was appointed as an elder in the Sanjeonghyun Church, which had branched out from Jangdaehyun Church.

Syngman Rhee learned English and entered the school operated by American Methodist missionaries, called Paichai Hakdang, with the aim of earning a substantial income. During his time there, he encountered Christian faith and Western learning. Additionally, he actively participated in the Independence Association and political reform movements. As a result, in 1899, the Independence Association disbanded, and he became implicated in the ‚ÄúPark Yeong-hyo Coup Plot,‚Äù leading to his imprisonment. Facing a death sentence, he recalled the sermons he had heard during his time at Paichai Hakdang and began reading the Bible and praying, ultimately converting to Christianity.
</p>
<p>
He became involved in the Korean language movement, writing while in prison, and developed a Christian theory of nation-building. After converting to Christianity, he wrote about his thoughts on Christianity, drawing from the Christian books he had read. His outlined strategy for the Korean church included (1) self-growth, (2) self-sustainability, (3) self-governance, and (4) unification with a spirit of unification added to Neviareus‚Äôs three principles. His vision was to establish and maintain a church that wouldn‚Äôt be dominated by other nations but would be built and sustained by the strength of Koreans, where the equality of God would be practiced.

<p>
After the 1907 National Debt Repayment Movement, organized anti-Japanese women‚Äôs movements were scarce. Capable men engaged in social activities established independence bases in places like Manchuria, China, and actively conducted armed independence movements. They also organized secret organizations within the country, maintaining close contact and support with overseas independence bases. However, it was not an easy task for women. Women had to engage in individual or small-scale acts of spiritual resistance until the opportunity for a massive independence struggle arose. They resisted Japan‚Äôs shallow attempts to take away Korea‚Äôs entire territory and attempted to pacify Koreans with meager consolation funds. They also passively resisted attempts to employ Korean women as domestic servants due to extreme poverty caused by Japanese economic exploitation.
</p>
<p>
Particularly, modern-educated female students formed secret societies with like-minded friends, organizing them into secret societies with different names to prepare for emergencies even after graduation. In 1913, three central figures, Hwang Esther, Kim Kyung-hee, and Park Jeong-seok, organized the Songjuk Secret Society (Songjuk Gyeolsa-dae) as a notable example.
</p>
<p>
At that time, Songjuk Secret Society expanded its activities nationally through careful planning. Hwang Esther primarily operated in Seoul, Kim Kyung-hee continued her activities at Sungshil Girls‚Äô School, and Park Jeong-seok was active in the church. They expanded the organization nationwide while keeping it secret. Songjuk Secret Society was named for its secretive nature. They were careful about accepting new members and followed strict regulations. A member needed a recommendation from an existing member, and unanimous approval was required for membership.
</p>
<p>
The organization had both a secure middle-aged group and an active young group, which were referred to as the ‚ÄúSong Brothers‚Äù and ‚ÄúJuk Brothers,‚Äù respectively. Their activities gradually expanded, and they even included Korean expatriates in Hawaii as members.
</p>
<p>
The declaration of independence by Korean students in Japan did not only end there; it also had an influence within the country. The ‚Äú2.8 Declaration of Independence‚Äù by Korean students in Tokyo could be aptly described as the magnificent ‚Äúoverture‚Äù of the March 1st Movement (Kang Deok-sang, Vol. 26, p.&nbsp;18).
</p>
<p>
During that time, there were a significant number of female students studying in Tokyo. Korean female students in Tokyo organized the ‚ÄúTokyo Women‚Äôs Friendship Society‚Äù and were actively engaged in various activities, even publishing their own magazine called ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs World‚Äù (Â•≥Â≠êÁïå). The president of this organization was Kim Maria, who was studying at a women‚Äôs school in Tokyo. Kim Maria was a devout elder of the Korean Presbyterian Church, hailing from Sorae Church, the first modern Korean church in Hwanghae Province. She had also graduated from Seoul‚Äôs Jungshin Women‚Äôs School. While Kim Maria didn‚Äôt directly participate in the activities of the ‚ÄúKorean Youth Independence Association,‚Äù which was promoting the independence declaration, she made a significant contribution to the birth of the February 8th Declaration of Independence by combining funds from the Women‚Äôs Friendship Society members and her own resources to support the activities of the Korean Youth Independence Association (Chosun Military Police Headquarters, 1969, p.&nbsp;24).
</p>
<p>
In order to convey this information to Korea, Kim Maria, along with Hwang Esther, secretly brought a copy of the independence declaration from Tokyo, concealing it within her kimono sash, and arrived in Busan in mid-February. In Busan, she met her third aunt, Kim Sun-ae, and her first uncle-in-law, Seo Byeong-ho, both of whom were on a secret mission to publicize the independence movement in Shanghai. They exchanged news about the independence movement in Shanghai and the independence declaration in Tokyo. Kim Maria met with figures in the religious and patriotic communities in Busan, showed them the ‚ÄúFebruary 8th Declaration of Independence‚Äù that she had concealed in her sash, and encouraged them to actively participate in the independence movement. She then traveled to Daegu, where she met with local religious and community leaders, urging them to support the independence movement. Afterward, she moved to Gwangju, where she met with her sister, Kim Ham-ra, and her brother-in-law, Nam Gung-hyeok, both of whom were patriotic activists, to convey news of the independence movement in Shanghai and Tokyo and promote the independence movement in Gwangju before heading to Seoul.
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving in Seoul, Kim Maria reunited with Hwang Esther. They met with teachers and graduates of Christian women‚Äôs schools to introduce overseas independence activities and discuss plans for domestic independence activities. They also met with figures from the social elite, including Kim Seong-su, Song Jin-woo, and Lee Jong-il, to discuss the independence movement. Lee Jong-il, the head of the Cheondogyo printing office, left a recollection of his meeting with Kim Maria as follows (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p.&nbsp;186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMaria Kim came to the Cheondogyo headquarters and Bosongsa and enthusiastically introduced the fact that, with the patriotic fervor of Korean male and female students overseas, they had declared independence. She made great efforts to encourage us to continue the movement even in our home country. I told Maria Kim that we had already been planning and quietly searching for ways to rise up together with the people since the year 1914, and she was delighted to hear about the grand ideology of Cheondogyo.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In addition to the activities of their seniors, Christian women‚Äôs school students were secretly preparing for independence through groups like the ‚ÄúKorean Christian Students‚Äô Association‚Äù (YMCA), which were linked to students in Tokyo and Shanghai. Even before the March 1st Movement, Christian female students were preparing for independence through their own secret organizations. In Seoul, Ewha Hakdang was used as a gathering place, communication hub, and distribution center for declarations and statements by female students in the city. The diary of one of these female students provides insight into the preparations and activities they undertook (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p. 186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFor two months, we made various preparations. We collected addresses of our fellow students, secured finances, and discreetly organized our comrades. Sometimes, we would arrange secret meetings by placing a wooden plank in front of a well and hiding underneath it, exchanging just a few words. On the morning of March 1st, without distinguishing between children and adults, we would go one by one and tell them what needed to be done today.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In a Confucian-based patriarchal society, it was almost unimaginable for women to form their own organizations, let alone participate in social organizations. However, as described above, Christian women like Kim Maria and Hwang Esther were not merely joining the independence movement but were focused on organizing and leading the independence movement independently by women‚Äôs own strength. They aimed to empower women to be active contributors to the nation‚Äôs independence struggle, not just passive participants, as reflected in the name ‚Äúnational‚Äù in the movement‚Äôs title. Additionally, Christian female students, who were still in school, were actively participating in the independence movement through their own determination and efforts.

<strong>Million Soul Movement.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Following the revivals in Wonsan in 1903 and Pyongyang in 1907, the ‚ÄúMillion Souls Movement‚Äù that unfolded in 1909 and 1910 was an effort by the Korean church to revitalize and grow. If the spiritual awakening seen in Wonsan and later in Pyongyang could be considered the workings of the Holy Spirit, the Million Souls Movement that unfolded over two years was, as the name suggests, a missionary movement aimed at evangelizing the nation.
</p>
<p>
It began with the goal of converting one million believers. While the general history of the revival that started in January 1907 lasted for about six months, it significantly weakened, particularly for the Presbyterian Church in March 1907 and the Methodist Church in April 1907, during the Cheongju and Gongju Conventions, respectively. In light of this reality, it was in the spirit of continuing the flames of revival by spreading them through missionary activities that six missionary boards, including the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches, jointly pursued the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
While there are differing views on the origins of this movement, it is generally known that American Methodist missionaries in the southern region, including F. K. Gamble, C. F. Reid, and M. B. Stokes, began praying for the revival of the Korean church in July 1909 in Songdo, Gyeonggi Province, which led to their inspiration for evangelism and revival. They started praying for the salvation of fifty thousand souls in their mission areas and, in September of the same year, during the Southern Methodist Church Convention held in Songdo, they set a goal to evangelize ‚Äútwo hundred thousand souls for Christ,‚Äù which later became the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
The Presbyterian Church also responded to this initiative. Pastor Kil Sun-joo, who served at Jangdaehyeon Church, conceived the idea of a large-scale evangelistic campaign upon his return to Pyongyang after completing a tour of the Amnokgang River coast in 1908. He proposed the idea of a church-wide evangelistic campaign while starting a morning prayer meeting at Jangdaehyeon Church and, in 1910, was appointed as vice-chairman and director of the Evangelism Department at the Fourth Donghak Society Congress, allowing him to implement this movement more concretely.
</p>
<p>
In summary, after experiencing the revival in Pyongyang, various attempts were made to rekindle this revival. These efforts, fueled by a desire for a new revival and national evangelization, coalesced into the Million Souls Movement in 1909. However, it was primarily promoted by Methodist missionaries, with the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches deciding to advance it as a church-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the General Council of Evangelical Missions in Korea, which convened in Seoul on October 8th and 9th, 1909, officially adopted the slogan ‚ÄúA Million Souls for Christ,‚Äù which had been adopted during the Southern Methodist Church Convention. They resolved to implement this movement nationwide and set a target period of one year until October 9, 1910, praying for abundant results.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the Christian population in Korea was less than 200,000, making the goal of converting one million believers seem overly ambitious. Nevertheless, the intention behind it was clear: one million believers would be enough to save the nation, safeguard its autonomy, and achieve independence. During this period, a prayer campaign took place, known as ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which symbolized the dedication of Korean Christians to the cause of evangelism. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù During the Million Souls Movement, Korean Christians pledged a total of 100,000 days of day offering. In Pyongyang alone, over a thousand Christians committed to dedicating 22,000 days to day offering. During this period, a prayer movement also emerged, with Friday night prayer meetings following Wednesday prayer meetings. In retrospect, this Friday night prayer movement can be seen as the precursor to the modern Friday Night Prayer Vigil.
</p>
<p>
In terms of results, the Million Souls Movement did not achieve its intended success. The number of actual converts fell far short of the proclaimed goal. Political factors, such as increasing pressure from Japan and the forced annexation of Korea in 1910, likely played a significant role in its lack of success. In fact, the Japanese authorities considered the Million Souls Movement a political activity by Koreans and interfered with the rallies. Additionally, the movement was unable to garner voluntary participation and mobilization of Koreans, despite being spearheaded by missionaries. Nevertheless, the dream of national evangelization and gospelization was a noble one.
</p>
<p>
During the Million Souls Movement, the dedication of Korean Christians was symbolized by ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which involved offering one‚Äôs daily life in a manner similar to offering material possessions. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù Missionaries including Gale served as chairman, with Underwood, Hugh Miller, and D. A. Bunker as members, to oversee the implementation of this movement. While the Million Souls Movement was essentially an interdenominational evangelistic campaign, it was primarily promoted by missionaries in Korea. The movement operated on two fronts:
</p>
<p>
First, there were mass evangelistic rallies. These rallies were held in various regions, including Seoul, and foreign revival preachers who happened to visit Korea at that time participated in these events. Well-known American revivalist pastors like J. Wilbur Chapman and gospel singer Charles M. Alexander held evangelistic rallies in Seoul and major cities. Robert Harkness, a member of the evangelistic team and a composer, wrote and popularized the hymn ‚ÄúTo a Million Souls for Jesus.‚Äù George T. B. Davis, among others, also participated in this effort. Many rallies were organized around these figures.
</p>
<p>
Second, there was house-to-house evangelism known as ‚ÄúChukho‚Äù (ÈÄêÊà∂) evangelism and day-offering. Evangelists visited homes, schools, and other places, distributing individual copies of the Gospel and tracts. During the Million Souls Movement, approximately 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark were distributed, along with around three million tracts. One of the most distinctive evangelistic methods during the Million Souls Movement was the distribution of a vast number of tracts and copies of the Gospel of Mark through a practice known as ‚ÄúDay Offering.‚Äù The term ‚ÄúDay Offering‚Äù referred to dedicating one‚Äôs time to the cause of evangelism, separate from material offerings. This movement received significant enthusiasm among believers, with around a thousand Christians in Pyongyang alone dedicating 22,000 days to Day Offering, and 10,000 days dedicated in the area of Jeryeong, Hwanghae Province. It is reported that over 100,000 days were dedicated nationwide. In regard to this Day Offering, the following passage was published in English in the monthly magazine ‚ÄòThe Korea Mission Field‚Äô:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDespite their hard and impoverished lives, the Korean people devoted a total of over 100,000 days to the evangelistic campaign. The number of days used last winter was 76,000, and this fall, hundreds of evangelists, along with student workers who went from house to house and leaders who attended large gatherings, dedicated an entire month. They distributed 3 million tracts, and believers, paying for them themselves, purchased 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark to distribute freely to their unbelieving compatriots, along with earnest recommendations and fervent prayers for them to read the Gospels and believe in Jesus. There were hardly any Korean households that did not receive visits for house-to-house evangelism. To obtain results in house-to-house evangelism, thousands of Koreans prayed daily.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Third, The First YMCA Student Evangelical Conference. Among the numerous gatherings held during the Million Souls Movement, one that stood out for its fervent passion for national evangelization was the YMCA Student Evangelical Conference, which attracted young university students. It took place from June 22nd to 27th, 1910, at the ancient temple of Jingwansa, located in the northern part of Seoul. Prominent missionaries like Underwood, Lee Sang-jae, Kim Gyu-sik, Kil Sun-joo, Evison, and Watson, along with Korean leaders, served as instructors and inspired young students with hope and visions for their nation. Religions joined forces in the face of Japanese aggression. Monks offered their rooms to students, and instead of chanting and the sound of wooden fish, hymns and prayers echoed throughout the temple.
</p>
<p>
Although it was a small-scale conference with 46 students representing ten universities, it was a precious gathering aimed at training outstanding students in a situation where the nation‚Äôs sovereignty had been taken away due to the Korea-Japan merger, with the hope of illuminating the nation‚Äôs future.
</p>
<p>
In the morning, there were Bible study sessions and special lectures led by missionaries. In the afternoons, various team-building sports activities were conducted. During the nighttime sessions, passionate lectures by teachers Lee Sang-jae and Kim Gyu-sik, who were deeply committed to Christian nationalism, were enough to ignite a fire in the hearts of the students. Participants made fervent commitments for the sake of their country and the church.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, While the numerical growth was limited compared to the efforts expended during the Daebu Revival or the Pyongyang Great Revival, it can be said that almost every village, even in remote areas, had some exposure to the Gospel. Missionaries and churches worked diligently with a sense of unity. It played a unifying role in harnessing the energy of the nation during one of the most challenging periods in its history. In a time of national despair, it offered hope and contributed to the spread of the belief that ‚ÄúChristianity is the hope of the nation.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ecumenical Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
On March 26, 1918, with the aim of effectively advancing their shared goal of Korean mission work, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church came together to establish the ‚ÄúKorean Joint Council of the Presbyterian and Methodist Missions.‚Äù Their collaboration extended across various areas, encompassing mission field allocation, Bible translation, medical missions, educational missions, mission publications, newspaper publications, hymnal publications, Sunday school initiatives, joint publishing endeavors, and document-based missions.
</p>
<p>
In pursuit of cooperative mission work, they took significant steps: in 1887, they founded the Bible Translation Committee; in 1890, the First Front Christian Publishing Society; and in 1905, the Union General Assembly of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches. There was even a movement to establish a single national church. However, the realization of a national church was hindered by several factors:
</p>
<p>
Individual denominations had already established their own systems.
</p>
<p>
The headquarters of these denominations, located in various countries, did not provide unified support for their respective missionaries and churches in Korea.
</p>
<p>
There was no strong governing entity, such as the government, to facilitate cooperation between major religions and pseudo-religions. As a result, the establishment of a national church remained elusive.

<p>
His contribution is characterized national advancement movement through educating the next-generation. Lee was born in the lower class but succeeded on his own business. During the Sino-Japanese war, his business went broke and went into retreat at his hometown in 1905 when the Joseon-Japan treat was established. Josen lost its diplomatic rights and Lee joined Seo-woo-Hak-hoe which was a youth enlightenment and literacy campaign organization in Northwest region (Pyongan)of Korea. In 1907 when the Hague Secret Emissary Agency failed to declare the invalidity of Japanese diplomatic maneuvers and Gojong was impeached by Japan, Lee listened to Ahn Chang-ho‚Äôs salvation of nation speech about protecting the national rights in Pyongyang.
</p>
<p>
Seung-hoon, having heard about Ahn Chang-ho for some time, decided to go and listen to his speech. When he arrived, he found a gathering of people, and at the center of it all was a passionate young man in his thirties dressed in a suit, addressing the crowd. He spoke about the state of the world, how Western civilization was using its power to influence the East, and how Japan, after learning from its experiences in the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars, was determined to absorb our country with the approval of the United Kingdom. He emphasized that to preserve our homeland with its 4,000 years of history, we must discard all the bad habits of the past and prioritize education, uniting the people to become something new. (Ham, 1988, p.&nbsp;31, recited in Kim, 2014, p.&nbsp;61).
</p>
<p>
There were two directions were facilitated in the Korean society to salvage the nation. One direction was armed independence campaign and the other was enlightenment and literacy campaign. Establishment of school and educating the youth was training the elite scholar military who will save the nation in the foreseeable future. In 1907, he founded Osan school at the Hyanggyo, Confucian institute, at Jeongju, Pyongan province. In 1910, he converted into Christians influenced by the great revival movement in Pyongyang and other North Korea regions. Lee listened to Han Seok-jin‚Äôs semon who was one of the first graduates from the Pyongyang theological seminary. Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross was interpreted as Korean people‚Äôs difficulties to survive and believed that Christianity which emphasizes love, service, and devotion was a way to unite Koreans.

<p>
<strong>Framing Christian Education.</strong> He returned to school, gathered the staff and students, and made a commitment to believe in Jesus Christ, deciding to hold religious gatherings at the school. He believed that the Christian spirit emphasizing dedication, service, and love could be the catalyst for the entire nation to regain strength and unity. Consequently, in December of that year, he changed the school‚Äôs educational leader based on Christian beliefs, appointing Pastor Slacy L. Robert as the principal and began teaching Bible studies. Later on, Teacher Yu Yeong-mo and Teacher Jo Man-sik, who would become principals, played crucial roles in establishing a strong foundation for faith education at Osan School. Although, in November 1923, due to the Japanese Education Decree of 1922, the Christian educational leadership was removed, and the school became a general institution, the atmosphere of religious gatherings and prayer continued within the school. It is said that hymns echoed through the school morning and evening, fostering a sense of camaraderie among colleagues.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
On the other hand, Nam Kang based his education on Christian values, making reverence, love, and sincerity (Êï¨ÊÑõË™†) the purpose of education. This involved respecting God and teachers (Êï¨), loving the nation and the country (ÊÑõ), and cultivating students who live truthfully and sincerely without falsehood (Ë™†). This educational purpose aligns with Osan School‚Äôs motto of ‚ÄòLove, Sincerity, and Respect.‚Äô His emphasis on righteousness (Áæ©) in education is well-reflected in Christian principles. He taught students to prioritize faith in their education, rejecting falsehood, laziness, selfishness, and cunning, and instead, always acting, learning, and living with a noble purpose. Nam Kang often quoted the Bible in his teachings, emphasizing, ‚ÄòBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.‚Äô This instruction aimed to instill honesty in the personal lives of graduates and encourage strong nationalistic sentiment in their struggle against Japanese colonialism.
</p>
<p>
Through this education, graduates learned to prioritize the well-being of others and the nation over personal success or gain. They developed a spirit of dedication and service to benefit everyone. They also learned that righteousness meant not being trampled upon or dragged around by others but living virtuously, which is the essence of justice. Ultimately, Nam Kang‚Äôs educational direction was closely aligned with Christian values, making him a figure who actively implemented Christian education principles.‚Äù

However, Japan used the pretext of the 105-People Incident to return him to Seoul, where he was arrested once again. Japan detained many individuals under various pretexts to weaken anti-Japanese forces within Korea, and the Ahn Myeong-geun‚Äôs unrelated school incident and the 105-Men Incident were part of these efforts.In this instance, Lee Seung- hun was falsely accused of being the mastermind behind the 105-People Incident and endured severe torture, ultimately receiving a ten-year prison sentence along with five others. Reflecting on this period, Nam Kang later said, ‚ÄòAlthough physically weakened during the five years from my escape from Jeju Island to my release, I deepened my faith through Bible study and spiritual growth.‚Äô
</p>
<p>
In February 1915, after escaping from prison, Lee Seung- hun received baptism and enrolled in Pyongyang Theological Seminary. In 1917, at the age of 54, he became one of the few elders in the church at the time and became a spiritual leader for many people. While in prison, he gathered people who had been scattered and, with Nam Kang at the center, engaged in national and modernization movements. They also constructed new buildings for Osan School and worked towards progressive education. Furthermore, he established connections with numerous leaders abroad and, from his position within the country, played a role in planning Korea‚Äôs liberation and independence movement.
</p>
<p>
In the year of the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919, representatives from different religious backgrounds, including Lee Seung- hun from the Christian side, signed a declaration of independence that had been prepared through a 33-person agreement. On March 1st, at 1:30 PM, they read the declaration at Taehwagwan Hall and proceeded to participate in the demonstration by shouting ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô at Pagoda Park. Lee Seung- hun served as a central figure in planning and coordinating this movement and was arrested along with other ethnic representatives before the ‚ÄòLong Live Independence‚Äô chants echoed. Among the representatives, Nam Kang received the harshest sentence, a three-year prison term, marking his third imprisonment. Meanwhile, as a pretext for eradicating the center of the independence movement, Japan razed and closed down Osan School and its buildings in late March of the same year.
</p>
<p>
On July 21, Lee Seung- hun, the last among the 48 individuals, including the 33 signatories of the Declaration of Independence and 15 others involved, escaped from the Kyungsung police station. Despite his increasingly weakened physical condition, he continued to lead his followers and, the following year, alongside figures like Yi Sang-jae and Yu Jin-tae, founded the Korean Education Association, continuing to advance his mission in guiding education throughout the country.

Due to the 105-People Incident, numerous participants in the anti-Japanese Christian movements in the northwestern region, particularly the majority of Sinminhoe members, were imprisoned. During this time, Ahn Chang-ho focused on strengthening the competency of the Korean people to regain independence. In contrast, Lee Si-yeong, Lee Dong-hui, and Kim Chwa-jin headed to Manchuria, Russia, and Gando, respectively, to continue pursuing the militant notion of independence.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
<strong>A Christian leader of the Korean immigrant community</strong>. Ahn Chang-ho played a crucial role in leading the Korean immigrant community in the U.S. and its independence movement. He established the United Korean Association (Gong-lip-Hyup-hoe) and published the Gong-lip-sin-bo, which was the first Korean newspaper in the U.S. While continuing to work on an orange farm in Riverside, California, a city known for its affluence per capita in the early 1900s (source: https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/04/27/uncovering-buried-past-early-korean-american-history-riverside), Ahn reported the assassination of Durham White Stevens (1851-1908) by Jan In-hwan. He also founded a labor union for Korean workers arriving from Korea, Hawaii, San Francisco, and other regions. Ahn introduced the church to Korean immigrants and collaborated with local churches and Christian organizations to facilitate educational programs.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
In Riverside, <mark>18 Korean laborers</mark> initially formed a public association, which later expanded to include 35 members. Ahn Chang-ho actively engaged in efforts to send these members to church. He visited nearby churches, met with pastors, and eventually chose to attend a Presbyterian church where he connected with a pastor he admired. Ahn Chang-ho requested this pastor to provide a volunteer teacher for the Pachappa Camp. Following a Sunday sermon, the pastor called for volunteers, and eleven individuals willingly stepped forward. Additionally, Ahn Chang-ho met with teachers and selected some among them (source: Ju, 1999, p.&nbsp;47, recited in Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;56).
</p>
<p>
Ahn emphasized the significance of unity among Koreans and coined the phrase ‚Äúpicking one orange in the U.S. saves the nation.‚Äù He utilized the church as a means to foster this unity. When he returned to the U.S. in 1911, he made efforts to address misunderstandings among Korean immigrants regarding the role of the church in Korea. While many intellectuals in Korea abandoned their faith during the annexation period, Ahn remained steadfast in his faith and emphasized the positive aspects of the church in Korea.
</p>
<p>
He countered claims that all Christians in Korea had fallen under Japanese influence, asserting that those with the strongest patriotic spirit could be found within the church. These individuals dedicated themselves to the cause of rebuilding the nation, as they were the ones who had lost their country and were now striving to regain it. Some members of the church had become subjects of Japan, but they were not originally church members or elders. They were individuals manipulated by the Japanese to secretly undergo baptism to gather intelligence about the church‚Äôs internal affairs. Although they outwardly participated in hymns and prayers, they could not be considered genuine Christians. Ahn argued that Japan might have been ahead in political and material civilization but could never match Korea‚Äôs spiritual and moral civilization. He emphasized that church members worked tirelessly for the sake of their fellow countrymen, and their patriotism was unwavering (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p.&nbsp;204, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;60).
</p>
<p>
Ahn further stressed the Christian mission and used questions and answers to train members of <em>Heung-sa-dan</em> (Youth Training Group) later on. As a leader, he prayed for Korean immigrants and took actions to spread information about the illegal suppression of the March 1st movement by the Japanese government. He emphasized that, under God‚Äôs divine command, they must continue forward, either through death or independence. He called for preparations to raise public awareness through newspapers and magazines and sought to widely publicize the tragic plight of Korean prisoners within the religious community. He requested prayers on their behalf and aimed to inform people across the United States about the situation in Korea, hoping to garner sympathy that would support their future efforts. He made a special plea to diplomats and compatriots in the United States (source: The compilation committee of the complete work of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, volume 5, 2000, p. 903, recited by Yi, 2004, p.&nbsp;64).

<p>
<strong>Developing an organizational network of the independence movement in the U.S. and provisioning the democratic republican form of government.</strong> Ahn was one of the founders of Shinminhoe and member of Seobukhakhoe whichcreated several patriotic enlightenment organizations in Korea and the U.S. The ultimate goal of the Shinminhoe was to establish a modern nation-state based on the principles of national sovereignty. Ahn Chang-ho presented a new goal for the modern nationalist movement, emphasizing the construction of a new Republic of Korea rather than the protection of the collapsing Korean Empire. At a time when the independence fighters and patriotic organizations were not considering abandoning the monarchy, the concept of a democratic republic was innovative. It also proposed a method for organizing and preparing for independence war in a systematic manner. Upon returning to the United States in 1911, Ahn Chang-ho established the Korean National Association and developed concrete plans for the independence movement within the Korean-American community. As depicted in the figure below, these plans were presented in five stages: (1) Foundation, (2) Preparation, (3) Full Preparation, (4) Progress Results, and (5) Full Results.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
The Foundation stage aimed to train young individuals with strong character traits such as sincerity, courage, and patience, instilling in them a sense of moral values. They were to be trained to unite firmly under the principles of unity of purpose, division of tasks, and coordinated action, with the goal of nurturing leadership figures who would guide the nationalist movement.
</p>
<p>
The Preparation stage involved the leaders produced in the Foundation stage establishing academic and vocational groups to prepare talent and resources in various fields. Academic groups were organizations that carried out activities related to academic studies, such as collective mathematics through communication or specialized education through school education. Vocational groups focused on organizing companies for agriculture, commerce, and industry, as well as establishing financial and transportation institutions to enhance the economic power of individuals.
</p>
<p>
Full Preparation was the stage where talents from various sectors were being cultivated through the activities of academic and vocational groups, and the required finances were secured. This stage aimed to ensure the availability of specialized professionals, including military commanders, politicians, technocrats, doctors, entrepreneurs, and scholars, to prepare for the future independence war. Additionally, it involved accumulating military, construction, and diplomatic funds.
</p>
<p>
Progress Results marked the point when the independence war against Japan was finally carried out, simultaneously establishing a national government that represented the entire Korean people.

</p>
<p>
Full Results involved the post-independence phase, where after defeating Japan through the independence war and regaining sovereignty, efforts were made to build a civilized and prosperous independent nation (Heungsadan, 2012)
</p>
<p>
In 1913, upon the establishment of the Heungsadan, a system was created that utilized the term ‚ÄòGod‚Äô and employed Christian-style catechisms for membership. Just as Christianity had expanded its influence through numerous denominations and churches, Ahn Chang-ho emphasized the need for organizational strength in the Korean nationalist movement, including the Heungsadan movement. During this time, he played a significant role in nurturing and engaging the Korean community in California.
</p>
<p>
In 1915, he visited Honolulu to help resolve conflicts within the Korean National Association of Hawaii. In 1917-18, he embarked on a tour to visit Korean immigrants in various parts of Mexico. In 1918, serving as the Chairman of the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association, he sent a recommendation letter to Korean compatriots in North America, Hawaii, and Mexico, urging unity. After the conclusion of World War I, he also took a leading role in sending Korean representatives to the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations, furthering the cause of Korea‚Äôs representation on the global stage.
</p>
<p>
During the March 1st Movement, at the Central Assembly of the Korean National Association in San Francisco, a speech titled ‚ÄúInheriting the March 1st Movement‚Äù was delivered with the following message: ‚ÄúUnder God‚Äôs divine command, we will continue forward, even if it means death or independence‚Äîthese are the two paths we will follow. ‚Ä¶We must now prepare ourselves and widely spread our message, using newspapers and magazines to stir public opinion and urging the religious community to pray for Korea‚Äôs current situation on our behalf.‚Äù (Yi, 2002, p.&nbsp;64)
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">

<p>
<strong>Independence movement fund-raising.</strong> After founding the Shinminhoe in 1907, Ahn Chang-ho established a branch of the Asia Industrial Company in Vladivostok in 1908. At that time, Vladivostok was seen as a convenient hub for communication with Korea, and it allowed for collaboration with Korean expatriates residing in Russia and China to form organizations. With the establishment of the Korean National Association, Ahn Chang-ho devised a system for raising funds for the long-term independence movement. This system became known as the ‚ÄúNational Duty Fund.‚Äù
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
This fund was used to publish a Korean-American newspaper called ‚ÄúShinhan Minbo,‚Äù establish churches, worship halls, and schools, and provide support for the independence movement. It also led to the creation of financial laws and regulations. This fund played a significant role in maintaining the Korean National Association in Hawaii and regional assemblies in North America. It continued for over 30 years.
</p>
<p>
This system is significant because it aimed to transform individuals into citizens and establish the concept of a duty-based monetary contribution. It laid the groundwork for long-term preparations for the independence movement.

Pro-Christian leader 3
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ï°∞ÎßåÏãù Cho Man-sik</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Cho Man-sik turned fourteen, he opened a general store called Baekmok Sangjeom on Pyongyang‚Äôs Jongno Street. The Pyongyang market was one of the three major markets during the Joseon Dynasty, along with Ganggyeong Market and Daegu Market. During this time, he earned a substantial amount of money and developed a reputation as someone who enjoyed drinking and spent money wisely.
</p>
<p>
In 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, prompting Cho to suspend his business and lead his family to seek refuge in the village of Beokdoji-ri on the middle reaches of the Daedong River. He was 22 years old at the time. While in exile, Cho attended a church in his friend Han Jeong-gyo‚Äôs guidance. Upon returning to Pyongyang, he continued attending church, following his friend to Jangdaehyun Church.
</p>
<p>
Jangdaehyun Church, initially known as Neoldarigol Church, was first established by missionary Samuel Moffett and later completed as a church building, eventually being renamed Jangdaehyun Church. During his time at Jangdaehyun Church, Cho decided to leave his business of eight years to focus on his studies.
</p>
<p>
Convincing his parents, Cho entered Sungsil Middle School at the late age of 22 in 1905. Sungsil Middle School had its origins in October 10, 1897, when American Presbyterian missionary W. M. Baird began gathering students at his home in Sinyang-ri, Pyongyang, which served as the prototype. The school was formally established as a Christian institution with the construction of its school building in 1901, funded by missionary William Swallen.
</p>
<p>
Upon enrolling in Sungsil School, Cho struggled with alcohol and tobacco addiction but gradually overcame these habits in the same year as he deepened his understanding of Christianity. He lived a disciplined life thereafter, strongly influenced by the teachings of Reverend W. M. Baird and Chinese teacher Park Ja-jung, both of whom inspired him with their guidance.
</p>
<p>
After graduating from Sungsil School in 1908, Cho immediately left for Japan to study. Until 1910, he studied English and mathematics at the Jeongchik English School. During his time in Japan, he was deeply moved by the writings of Mahatma Gandhi, who was striving for India‚Äôs independence. He sympathized with Gandhi‚Äôs philosophy of nonviolent resistance and adopted it as the cornerstone of his own lifelong struggle for Korean independence. This is why he came to be known as the ‚ÄúKorean Gandhi.‚Äù
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
<strong>Tokyo church and support for Korean students in Japan and their independence movement.</strong> In 1910, Cho graduated from the Jeongchik English School and enrolled in the specialized law department of Meiji Law College. He actively participated in the Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA) and served as the president of the Christian Youth Association in Tokyo. After witnessing the division between Presbyterian and Methodist churches in worship, he reorganized them into a unified church, allowing Korean students to worship together.<br> <br> The pioneers of the ‚ÄòMother‚Äô church, the Tokyo Church, which was the cradle of independence activists, were Christian independence activists themselves. Kim Jeong-sik, originally an activist in the Independence Association, converted to Christianity after the outbreak of the March 1st Movement and became a key figure in establishing the Hwangseong Christian Youth Association, attending Yeondong Church. Cho Man-sik, who embraced Christianity before enrolling in Pyongyang‚Äôs Suksil Middle School, dedicated himself to the independence movement in his homeland after studying in Japan and played a crucial role in the fostering of an independent spirit. Following Kim Jeong-sik, Baek Nam-hoon assumed the position of the second secretary-general of the Joseon Christian Youth Association in Tokyo.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
Initially, Tokyo Church, which held its worship services at the Joseon Christian Youth Association building in Tokyo, had congregants who were primarily from the Presbyterian tradition and started as a Presbyterian church. However, after 1910, there was an increase in congregants who were of Methodist background. They requested the establishment of a Methodist church in Tokyo to their home country. During their stay in Japan, they decided to put denominational differences aside and proposed establishing a joint church for worship. Consequently, starting from 1911, the church changed its name to ‚ÄòKorea-Japan Tokyo United Christian Church‚Äô and conducted united worship services. This ecumenical collaborative effort between the two denominations continued as they alternated between sending ministers from the Presbyterian and Methodist traditions, setting an example of ecumenical cooperation that is still respected today.
</p>
<p>
Many members of the Tokyo Church who chose to study in Japan with the hope of someday restoring their homeland played a significant role in the independence movement. Particularly, prominent figures like Baek Nam-hoon, Yun Chang-seok, Choi Pal-yong, and Jeon Yeong-taek, who led the 1919 ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence,‚Äô were all young members of the Tokyo Church. Their unwavering dedication and sacrifices in achieving the ‚ÄòMarch 1st Declaration of Independence‚Äô served as a catalyst for the March 1st Movement and conveyed Korea‚Äôs determination for independence to the global community.
</p>
<p>
He urged, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not ask about our hometowns,‚Äù and joined forces with Song Jin-woo from Jeolla Province and Ahn Jae-hong from Gyeonggi Province to unify Korean student associations in Tokyo. Later, the Korean student associations in Tokyo played a foundational role in the 2.8 Declaration of Independence, a movement by Korean students studying in Japan for Korea‚Äôs independence.

<strong>Independence Movement and Educating the Next Generation</strong>. In March 1931, at the age of 31, Cho graduated from Meiji University and returned to Korea. He took up a teaching position at Osan School, established by Yi Seung-hoon, who had initiated the enlightenment movement in Pyeonganbuk-do Province‚Äôs Jeongju. At the time, Yi Seung-hoon had been imprisoned in the 105-person incident, and the school faced challenges.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
In 1919, Cho joined the March 1st Movement, leaving his position as the principal of Osan School. While in exile in Shanghai, he was pursued by Japanese military police in Gangdong, Pyeongannam-do Province, and was arrested. He spent a year in Pyongyang Prison. After his release from Pyongyang Prison, Cho returned to Osan School to work as the principal again. In 1921, he became the general secretary of the YMCA Youth Council and was appointed as an elder in the Sanjeonghyun Church, which had branched out from Jangdaehyun Church.

</p>
<p>
Syngman Rhee learned English and entered the school operated by American Methodist missionaries, called Paichai Hakdang, with the aim of earning a substantial income. During his time there, he encountered Christian faith and Western learning. Additionally, he actively participated in the Independence Association and political reform movements. As a result, in 1899, the Independence Association disbanded, and he became implicated in the ‚ÄúPark Yeong-hyo Coup Plot,‚Äù leading to his imprisonment. Facing a death sentence, he recalled the sermons he had heard during his time at Paichai Hakdang and began reading the Bible and praying, ultimately converting to Christianity.
</p>
<p>
He became involved in the Korean language movement, writing while in prison, and developed a Christian theory of nation-building. After converting to Christianity, he wrote about his thoughts on Christianity, drawing from the Christian books he had read. His outlined strategy for the Korean church included (1) self-growth, (2) self-sustainability, (3) self-governance, and (4) unification with a spirit of unification added to Neviareus‚Äôs three principles. His vision was to establish and maintain a church that wouldn‚Äôt be dominated by other nations but would be built and sustained by the strength of Koreans, where the equality of God would be practiced.

<p>
After the 1907 National Debt Repayment Movement, organized anti-Japanese women‚Äôs movements were scarce. Capable men engaged in social activities established independence bases in places like Manchuria, China, and actively conducted armed independence movements. They also organized secret organizations within the country, maintaining close contact and support with overseas independence bases. However, it was not an easy task for women. Women had to engage in individual or small-scale acts of spiritual resistance until the opportunity for a massive independence struggle arose. They resisted Japan‚Äôs shallow attempts to take away Korea‚Äôs entire territory and attempted to pacify Koreans with meager consolation funds. They also passively resisted attempts to employ Korean women as domestic servants due to extreme poverty caused by Japanese economic exploitation.
</p>
<p>
Particularly, modern-educated female students formed secret societies with like-minded friends, organizing them into secret societies with different names to prepare for emergencies even after graduation. In 1913, three central figures, Hwang Esther, Kim Kyung-hee, and Park Jeong-seok, organized the Songjuk Secret Society (Songjuk Gyeolsa-dae) as a notable example.
</p>
<p>
At that time, Songjuk Secret Society expanded its activities nationally through careful planning. Hwang Esther primarily operated in Seoul, Kim Kyung-hee continued her activities at Sungshil Girls‚Äô School, and Park Jeong-seok was active in the church. They expanded the organization nationwide while keeping it secret. Songjuk Secret Society was named for its secretive nature. They were careful about accepting new members and followed strict regulations. A member needed a recommendation from an existing member, and unanimous approval was required for membership.
</p>
<p>
The organization had both a secure middle-aged group and an active young group, which were referred to as the ‚ÄúSong Brothers‚Äù and ‚ÄúJuk Brothers,‚Äù respectively. Their activities gradually expanded, and they even included Korean expatriates in Hawaii as members.
</p>
<p>
The declaration of independence by Korean students in Japan did not only end there; it also had an influence within the country. The ‚Äú2.8 Declaration of Independence‚Äù by Korean students in Tokyo could be aptly described as the magnificent ‚Äúoverture‚Äù of the March 1st Movement (Kang Deok-sang, Vol. 26, p.&nbsp;18).
</p>
<p>
During that time, there were a significant number of female students studying in Tokyo. Korean female students in Tokyo organized the ‚ÄúTokyo Women‚Äôs Friendship Society‚Äù and were actively engaged in various activities, even publishing their own magazine called ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs World‚Äù (Â•≥Â≠êÁïå). The president of this organization was Kim Maria, who was studying at a women‚Äôs school in Tokyo. Kim Maria was a devout elder of the Korean Presbyterian Church, hailing from Sorae Church, the first modern Korean church in Hwanghae Province. She had also graduated from Seoul‚Äôs Jungshin Women‚Äôs School. While Kim Maria didn‚Äôt directly participate in the activities of the ‚ÄúKorean Youth Independence Association,‚Äù which was promoting the independence declaration, she made a significant contribution to the birth of the February 8th Declaration of Independence by combining funds from the Women‚Äôs Friendship Society members and her own resources to support the activities of the Korean Youth Independence Association (Chosun Military Police Headquarters, 1969, p.&nbsp;24).
</p>
<p>
In order to convey this information to Korea, Kim Maria, along with Hwang Esther, secretly brought a copy of the independence declaration from Tokyo, concealing it within her kimono sash, and arrived in Busan in mid-February. In Busan, she met her third aunt, Kim Sun-ae, and her first uncle-in-law, Seo Byeong-ho, both of whom were on a secret mission to publicize the independence movement in Shanghai. They exchanged news about the independence movement in Shanghai and the independence declaration in Tokyo. Kim Maria met with figures in the religious and patriotic communities in Busan, showed them the ‚ÄúFebruary 8th Declaration of Independence‚Äù that she had concealed in her sash, and encouraged them to actively participate in the independence movement. She then traveled to Daegu, where she met with local religious and community leaders, urging them to support the independence movement. Afterward, she moved to Gwangju, where she met with her sister, Kim Ham-ra, and her brother-in-law, Nam Gung-hyeok, both of whom were patriotic activists, to convey news of the independence movement in Shanghai and Tokyo and promote the independence movement in Gwangju before heading to Seoul.
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving in Seoul, Kim Maria reunited with Hwang Esther. They met with teachers and graduates of Christian women‚Äôs schools to introduce overseas independence activities and discuss plans for domestic independence activities. They also met with figures from the social elite, including Kim Seong-su, Song Jin-woo, and Lee Jong-il, to discuss the independence movement. Lee Jong-il, the head of the Cheondogyo printing office, left a recollection of his meeting with Kim Maria as follows (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p.&nbsp;186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMaria Kim came to the Cheondogyo headquarters and Bosongsa and enthusiastically introduced the fact that, with the patriotic fervor of Korean male and female students overseas, they had declared independence. She made great efforts to encourage us to continue the movement even in our home country. I told Maria Kim that we had already been planning and quietly searching for ways to rise up together with the people since the year 1914, and she was delighted to hear about the grand ideology of Cheondogyo.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In addition to the activities of their seniors, Christian women‚Äôs school students were secretly preparing for independence through groups like the ‚ÄúKorean Christian Students‚Äô Association‚Äù (YMCA), which were linked to students in Tokyo and Shanghai. Even before the March 1st Movement, Christian female students were preparing for independence through their own secret organizations. In Seoul, Ewha Hakdang was used as a gathering place, communication hub, and distribution center for declarations and statements by female students in the city. The diary of one of these female students provides insight into the preparations and activities they undertook (March 1st Women‚Äôs Solidarity Association, p. 186):
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFor two months, we made various preparations. We collected addresses of our fellow students, secured finances, and discreetly organized our comrades. Sometimes, we would arrange secret meetings by placing a wooden plank in front of a well and hiding underneath it, exchanging just a few words. On the morning of March 1st, without distinguishing between children and adults, we would go one by one and tell them what needed to be done today.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In a Confucian-based patriarchal society, it was almost unimaginable for women to form their own organizations, let alone participate in social organizations. However, as described above, Christian women like Kim Maria and Hwang Esther were not merely joining the independence movement but were focused on organizing and leading the independence movement independently by women‚Äôs own strength. They aimed to empower women to be active contributors to the nation‚Äôs independence struggle, not just passive participants, as reflected in the name ‚Äúnational‚Äù in the movement‚Äôs title. Additionally, Christian female students, who were still in school, were actively participating in the independence movement through their own determination and efforts.

<strong>Million Soul Movement.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Following the revivals in Wonsan in 1903 and Pyongyang in 1907, the ‚ÄúMillion Souls Movement‚Äù that unfolded in 1909 and 1910 was an effort by the Korean church to revitalize and grow. If the spiritual awakening seen in Wonsan and later in Pyongyang could be considered the workings of the Holy Spirit, the Million Souls Movement that unfolded over two years was, as the name suggests, a missionary movement aimed at evangelizing the nation.
</p>
<p>
It began with the goal of converting one million believers. While the general history of the revival that started in January 1907 lasted for about six months, it significantly weakened, particularly for the Presbyterian Church in March 1907 and the Methodist Church in April 1907, during the Cheongju and Gongju Conventions, respectively. In light of this reality, it was in the spirit of continuing the flames of revival by spreading them through missionary activities that six missionary boards, including the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches, jointly pursued the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
While there are differing views on the origins of this movement, it is generally known that American Methodist missionaries in the southern region, including F. K. Gamble, C. F. Reid, and M. B. Stokes, began praying for the revival of the Korean church in July 1909 in Songdo, Gyeonggi Province, which led to their inspiration for evangelism and revival. They started praying for the salvation of fifty thousand souls in their mission areas and, in September of the same year, during the Southern Methodist Church Convention held in Songdo, they set a goal to evangelize ‚Äútwo hundred thousand souls for Christ,‚Äù which later became the Million Souls Movement.
</p>
<p>
The Presbyterian Church also responded to this initiative. Pastor Kil Sun-joo, who served at Jangdaehyeon Church, conceived the idea of a large-scale evangelistic campaign upon his return to Pyongyang after completing a tour of the Amnokgang River coast in 1908. He proposed the idea of a church-wide evangelistic campaign while starting a morning prayer meeting at Jangdaehyeon Church and, in 1910, was appointed as vice-chairman and director of the Evangelism Department at the Fourth Donghak Society Congress, allowing him to implement this movement more concretely.
</p>
<p>
In summary, after experiencing the revival in Pyongyang, various attempts were made to rekindle this revival. These efforts, fueled by a desire for a new revival and national evangelization, coalesced into the Million Souls Movement in 1909. However, it was primarily promoted by Methodist missionaries, with the Korean Mission Boards of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches deciding to advance it as a church-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the General Council of Evangelical Missions in Korea, which convened in Seoul on October 8th and 9th, 1909, officially adopted the slogan ‚ÄúA Million Souls for Christ,‚Äù which had been adopted during the Southern Methodist Church Convention. They resolved to implement this movement nationwide and set a target period of one year until October 9, 1910, praying for abundant results.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the Christian population in Korea was less than 200,000, making the goal of converting one million believers seem overly ambitious. Nevertheless, the intention behind it was clear: one million believers would be enough to save the nation, safeguard its autonomy, and achieve independence. During this period, a prayer campaign took place, known as ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which symbolized the dedication of Korean Christians to the cause of evangelism. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù During the Million Souls Movement, Korean Christians pledged a total of 100,000 days of day offering. In Pyongyang alone, over a thousand Christians committed to dedicating 22,000 days to day offering. During this period, a prayer movement also emerged, with Friday night prayer meetings following Wednesday prayer meetings. In retrospect, this Friday night prayer movement can be seen as the precursor to the modern Friday Night Prayer Vigil.
</p>
<p>
In terms of results, the Million Souls Movement did not achieve its intended success. The number of actual converts fell far short of the proclaimed goal. Political factors, such as increasing pressure from Japan and the forced annexation of Korea in 1910, likely played a significant role in its lack of success. In fact, the Japanese authorities considered the Million Souls Movement a political activity by Koreans and interfered with the rallies. Additionally, the movement was unable to garner voluntary participation and mobilization of Koreans, despite being spearheaded by missionaries. Nevertheless, the dream of national evangelization and gospelization was a noble one.
</p>
<p>
During the Million Souls Movement, the dedication of Korean Christians was symbolized by ‚ÄúDay Offering,‚Äù which involved offering one‚Äôs daily life in a manner similar to offering material possessions. Missionaries referred to this as ‚Äúday preaching‚Äù or ‚Äúday offering.‚Äù Missionaries including Gale served as chairman, with Underwood, Hugh Miller, and D. A. Bunker as members, to oversee the implementation of this movement. While the Million Souls Movement was essentially an interdenominational evangelistic campaign, it was primarily promoted by missionaries in Korea. The movement operated on two fronts:
</p>
<p>
First, there were mass evangelistic rallies. These rallies were held in various regions, including Seoul, and foreign revival preachers who happened to visit Korea at that time participated in these events. Well-known American revivalist pastors like J. Wilbur Chapman and gospel singer Charles M. Alexander held evangelistic rallies in Seoul and major cities. Robert Harkness, a member of the evangelistic team and a composer, wrote and popularized the hymn ‚ÄúTo a Million Souls for Jesus.‚Äù George T. B. Davis, among others, also participated in this effort. Many rallies were organized around these figures.
</p>
<p>
Second, there was house-to-house evangelism known as ‚ÄúChukho‚Äù (ÈÄêÊà∂) evangelism and day-offering. Evangelists visited homes, schools, and other places, distributing individual copies of the Gospel and tracts. During the Million Souls Movement, approximately 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark were distributed, along with around three million tracts. One of the most distinctive evangelistic methods during the Million Souls Movement was the distribution of a vast number of tracts and copies of the Gospel of Mark through a practice known as ‚ÄúDay Offering.‚Äù The term ‚ÄúDay Offering‚Äù referred to dedicating one‚Äôs time to the cause of evangelism, separate from material offerings. This movement received significant enthusiasm among believers, with around a thousand Christians in Pyongyang alone dedicating 22,000 days to Day Offering, and 10,000 days dedicated in the area of Jeryeong, Hwanghae Province. It is reported that over 100,000 days were dedicated nationwide. In regard to this Day Offering, the following passage was published in English in the monthly magazine ‚ÄòThe Korea Mission Field‚Äô:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDespite their hard and impoverished lives, the Korean people devoted a total of over 100,000 days to the evangelistic campaign. The number of days used last winter was 76,000, and this fall, hundreds of evangelists, along with student workers who went from house to house and leaders who attended large gatherings, dedicated an entire month. They distributed 3 million tracts, and believers, paying for them themselves, purchased 700,000 copies of the Gospel of Mark to distribute freely to their unbelieving compatriots, along with earnest recommendations and fervent prayers for them to read the Gospels and believe in Jesus. There were hardly any Korean households that did not receive visits for house-to-house evangelism. To obtain results in house-to-house evangelism, thousands of Koreans prayed daily.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Third, The First YMCA Student Evangelical Conference. Among the numerous gatherings held during the Million Souls Movement, one that stood out for its fervent passion for national evangelization was the YMCA Student Evangelical Conference, which attracted young university students. It took place from June 22nd to 27th, 1910, at the ancient temple of Jingwansa, located in the northern part of Seoul. Prominent missionaries like Underwood, Lee Sang-jae, Kim Gyu-sik, Kil Sun-joo, Evison, and Watson, along with Korean leaders, served as instructors and inspired young students with hope and visions for their nation. Religions joined forces in the face of Japanese aggression. Monks offered their rooms to students, and instead of chanting and the sound of wooden fish, hymns and prayers echoed throughout the temple.
</p>
<p>
Although it was a small-scale conference with 46 students representing ten universities, it was a precious gathering aimed at training outstanding students in a situation where the nation‚Äôs sovereignty had been taken away due to the Korea-Japan merger, with the hope of illuminating the nation‚Äôs future.
</p>
<p>
In the morning, there were Bible study sessions and special lectures led by missionaries. In the afternoons, various team-building sports activities were conducted. During the nighttime sessions, passionate lectures by teachers Lee Sang-jae and Kim Gyu-sik, who were deeply committed to Christian nationalism, were enough to ignite a fire in the hearts of the students. Participants made fervent commitments for the sake of their country and the church.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, While the numerical growth was limited compared to the efforts expended during the Daebu Revival or the Pyongyang Great Revival, it can be said that almost every village, even in remote areas, had some exposure to the Gospel. Missionaries and churches worked diligently with a sense of unity. It played a unifying role in harnessing the energy of the nation during one of the most challenging periods in its history. In a time of national despair, it offered hope and contributed to the spread of the belief that ‚ÄúChristianity is the hope of the nation.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ecumenical Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
On March 26, 1918, with the aim of effectively advancing their shared goal of Korean mission work, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church came together to establish the ‚ÄúKorean Joint Council of the Presbyterian and Methodist Missions.‚Äù Their collaboration extended across various areas, encompassing mission field allocation, Bible translation, medical missions, educational missions, mission publications, newspaper publications, hymnal publications, Sunday school initiatives, joint publishing endeavors, and document-based missions.
</p>
<p>
In pursuit of cooperative mission work, they took significant steps: in 1887, they founded the Bible Translation Committee; in 1890, the First Front Christian Publishing Society; and in 1905, the Union General Assembly of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches. There was even a movement to establish a single national church. However, the realization of a national church was hindered by several factors:
</p>
<p>
Individual denominations had already established their own systems.
</p>
<p>
The headquarters of these denominations, located in various countries, did not provide unified support for their respective missionaries and churches in Korea.
</p>
<p>
There was no strong governing entity, such as the government, to facilitate cooperation between major religions and pseudo-religions. As a result, the establishment of a national church remained elusive.
