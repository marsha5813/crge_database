The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

<p>
During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

<p>
Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy‚Äîmassive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.

<p>
The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.
</p>
<p>
Theologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park‚Äôs contributions by noting that ‚Äúas a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,‚Äù and that his efforts ‚Äúhad a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Park‚Äôs solidarity was not simply a political choice‚Äîit was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.

Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.
</p>
<p>
Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

<p>
The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.

Toward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from ‚Äúactivist theology‚Äù to a more sensitive ‚Äútheology of suffering.‚Äù He lamented that ‚Äúmigrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives‚Äîeven within minjung theology.‚Äù‚Å∑ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward ‚Äúthe different textures of suffering.‚Äù<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.

Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

Dorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, ‚ÄúKorea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present‚Äîlistening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.

The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>

<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

</p>

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

<p>
During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.

<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy‚Äîmassive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.

<p>
The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.

Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.
</p>
<p>
Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

<p>
The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from ‚Äúactivist theology‚Äù to a more sensitive ‚Äútheology of suffering.‚Äù He lamented that ‚Äúmigrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives‚Äîeven within minjung theology.‚Äù‚Å∑ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward ‚Äúthe different textures of suffering.‚Äù<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

Dorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, ‚ÄúKorea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present‚Äîlistening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.

</p>

<p>
The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

<p>
During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

<p>
Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.

<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy‚Äîmassive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.

<p>
The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.
</p>
<p>
Theologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park‚Äôs contributions by noting that ‚Äúas a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,‚Äù and that his efforts ‚Äúhad a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Park‚Äôs solidarity was not simply a political choice‚Äîit was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.

<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.

Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.

<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

<p>
The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

<p>
In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from ‚Äúactivist theology‚Äù to a more sensitive ‚Äútheology of suffering.‚Äù He lamented that ‚Äúmigrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives‚Äîeven within minjung theology.‚Äù‚Å∑ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward ‚Äúthe different textures of suffering.‚Äù<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

1926 ~ 12/14/2018
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, ‚ÄúKorea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present‚Äîlistening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.

<p>
The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

</p>

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

<p>
During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

<p>
Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy‚Äîmassive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.

<p>
The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.
</p>
<p>
Theologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park‚Äôs contributions by noting that ‚Äúas a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,‚Äù and that his efforts ‚Äúhad a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Park‚Äôs solidarity was not simply a political choice‚Äîit was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.

<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.
</p>
<p>
Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

<p>
In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

<p>
In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from ‚Äúactivist theology‚Äù to a more sensitive ‚Äútheology of suffering.‚Äù He lamented that ‚Äúmigrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives‚Äîeven within minjung theology.‚Äù‚Å∑ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward ‚Äúthe different textures of suffering.‚Äù<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea.

<p>
The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

<p>
During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

<p>
Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.

<p>
The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.
</p>
<p>
Theologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park‚Äôs contributions by noting that ‚Äúas a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,‚Äù and that his efforts ‚Äúhad a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Park‚Äôs solidarity was not simply a political choice‚Äîit was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.

<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.
</p>
<p>
Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

<p>
The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

<p>
In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from ‚Äúactivist theology‚Äù to a more sensitive ‚Äútheology of suffering.‚Äù He lamented that ‚Äúmigrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives‚Äîeven within minjung theology.‚Äù‚Å∑ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward ‚Äúthe different textures of suffering.‚Äù<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

Dorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)

<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, ‚ÄúKorea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present‚Äîlistening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.

06/01/1918 ~ 01/18/1994
</p>

<p>
The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009
</p>

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

<p>
Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy‚Äîmassive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.

The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.
</p>
<p>
Theologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park‚Äôs contributions by noting that ‚Äúas a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,‚Äù and that his efforts ‚Äúhad a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Park‚Äôs solidarity was not simply a political choice‚Äîit was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.

<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.
</p>
<p>
Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

<p>
The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

<p>
In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from ‚Äúactivist theology‚Äù to a more sensitive ‚Äútheology of suffering.‚Äù He lamented that ‚Äúmigrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives‚Äîeven within minjung theology.‚Äù‚Å∑ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward ‚Äúthe different textures of suffering.‚Äù<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.

Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

Dorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)

<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, ‚ÄúKorea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present‚Äîlistening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.

The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

07/02/1922 ~ 02/16/2009
</p>

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

<p>
During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

<p>
Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy‚Äîmassive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.

<p>
The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.
</p>
<p>
Theologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park‚Äôs contributions by noting that ‚Äúas a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,‚Äù and that his efforts ‚Äúhad a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Park‚Äôs solidarity was not simply a political choice‚Äîit was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.

<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.
</p>
<p>
Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

<p>
The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br><em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of his life, Ahn called for a shift from ‚Äúactivist theology‚Äù to a more sensitive ‚Äútheology of suffering.‚Äù He lamented that ‚Äúmigrant voices, women, the disabled, LGBTQ persons, and others had been drowned out by dominant narratives‚Äîeven within minjung theology.‚Äù‚Å∑ He urged future theologians to cultivate a more refined empathy toward ‚Äúthe different textures of suffering.‚Äù<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> This marked his final theological horizon: a minjung theology sharpened by silence, suffering, and sensibility.

Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

Dorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, ‚ÄúKorea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present‚Äîlistening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.

The 1980s marked the culmination of Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs vocation as a prophetic Christian leader, where his theological convictions, national conscience, and practical activism converged in bold defiance of South Korea‚Äôs authoritarianism and division. From labor and human rights advocacy to democratization and inter-Korean engagement, Moon emerged as a singular figure embodying the integration of spirituality and politics.
</p>
<p>
Raised in the ethnic Korean Christian community of Myungdong Village in Manchuria, Moon inherited a legacy of national struggle and ecumenical faith from his father, Rev.&nbsp;Moon Jae-rin. He later recalled, ‚ÄúSolving the national problem of reunification became my entire being and, in turn, my entire faith,‚Äù acknowledging that his political vision of reunification had always been a theological calling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. His worldview integrated Christianity, Confucian ethics, and nationalism, grounded in the lived experiences of marginalized people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Moon served as Vice Chair of the Korean Human Rights Movement Council, where he led the drafting of the declaration titled <em>‚ÄúHuman Rights of 50 Million Koreans.‚Äù</em> The document affirmed five essential freedoms: the right to life without hunger, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to resist injustice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was also elected Chair of the Committee for the Construction of the Jeon Tae-il Memorial Hall in 1983. His statement‚Äî‚ÄúJeon Tae-il‚Äôs death is not a grave, not the end of life‚Äîit is a resurrection that brings new hope‚Äù‚Äîreflected his conviction that the martyrdom of a worker could become the starting point for a movement of justice, democracy, and national healing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. For Moon, Jeon Tae-il became a moral barometer of the nation‚Äôs conscience<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Moon‚Äôs activism found fuller expression during South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy uprisings. As chair of the National Coalition for Democratic Reunification (ÎØºÌÜµÎ†®), he supported the 1987 June Struggle and continuously advocated for the ‚Äúeconomic democratization of everyday life,‚Äù arguing that political reform was meaningless without structural change for workers, farmers, and the urban poor<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the most defining moment of Moon‚Äôs prophetic life came in March 1989, when he defied state restrictions and traveled to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. In their historic conversation, Moon challenged the ideological core of the North‚Äôs regime: ‚ÄúThe most serious obstacle to reunification from the South‚Äôs point of view is the Juche ideology. Shouldn‚Äôt Juche now turn its focus from the leader to the people?‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Moon reimagined reunification not through political negotiation, but through a gospel-centered ethic of human dignity and reconciliation. ‚ÄúI did not come here for a conversation with words, but a conversation with the heart and eyes. I came to seek a path where all of us can be victors,‚Äù he told Kim<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This encounter culminated in the signing of the April 2 (4¬∑2) Joint Statement with North Korean official Huh Dam, affirming:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The three fundamental principles of independence, peace, and national unity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That Korea, despite its division, is ‚Äúone nation and one state‚Äù
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A shared commitment to political and military dialogue, as well as interpersonal exchanges like family reunions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A consensus that a federal system for reunification could be pursued gradually or immediately<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This framework would later serve as a conceptual foundation for the 2000 June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, especially in its embrace of a ‚Äúloose federal system.‚Äù Yet upon his return to South Korea, Moon was arrested under the National Security Law and incarcerated once again. The response from Korean society‚Äîand the Christian community in particular‚Äîwas starkly divided. Conservative media and churches condemned his actions as reckless, calling him merely ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äù to deny his clerical identity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Some denominations even called for his excommunication.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, progressive Christians and civic organizations hailed Moon‚Äôs visit as an act of prophetic obedience and moral clarity. They interpreted his dialogue with Kim Il-sung not as political appeasement, but as an effort to incarnate the gospel in a geopolitically divided reality<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite backlash, Moon Ik-hwan remained firm in his belief that ‚Äúreunification without democracy is violence, and democracy without reunification is emptiness.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> His vision transcended the binary of ‚Äúreunification first‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratization first,‚Äù instead offering a holistic and ethical vision grounded in peace, justice, and faith. Today, Moon‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s is remembered not merely for its symbolism, but for its practical and theological daring. His life during that decade can best be summarized as ‚Äúa reunification movement through prayer, a democratization movement through song, and a justice movement through love.‚Äù

</p>

<p>
Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan stood as the unshaken moral voice of Korea during the darkest decade of military dictatorship. In a time when violence, censorship, and systemic oppression defined daily life, he proclaimed with unwavering clarity that the Church must exist not only for heaven but for the dignity of all people on earth. His words and actions did not merely echo from pulpits; they reverberated through prison cells, protest camps, and presidential offices alike.
</p>
<p>
His moral compass was most sharply evident during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military regime prepared to suppress civilians with armed force. Unable to reach Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, Kim took extraordinary steps to prevent the bloodshed: he visited the Apostolic Nuncio and the U.S. ambassador late at night, urging them to intervene. ‚ÄúIf the government sends troops to Gwangju,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will be an unforgivable sin in Korea‚Äôs modern history‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. His attempt may not have stopped the massacre, but it showed the world that the Church did not remain silent while the innocent bled.
</p>
<p>
The defense of human rights was not episodic but a sustained pastoral stance. When Bishop Ji Hak-soon was imprisoned under fabricated charges, Cardinal Kim negotiated directly with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency for his release<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. As Myeongdong Cathedral became a sanctuary for protesters, students, and dissidents, he neither incited nor discouraged them‚Äîbut protected them. ‚ÄúThe Church must remain a place of peace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúViolence cannot coexist with the Church‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even under pressure from the government and conservative clergy, he refused to shut the doors.
</p>
<p>
He recognized that silence, too, is a form of violence. In 1987, when student Park Jong-cheol was tortured to death by police, Kim did not remain neutral. He allowed the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice to hold masses and issue statements that exposed the truth. ‚ÄúJustice vanishes in silence; silence is complicity,‚Äù he declared<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. These actions lent legitimacy to the June Democratic Uprising, helping transform outrage into collective resistance.
</p>
<p>
He never allowed political calculation to override ethical clarity. When the Roh Tae-woo administration was exposed in a massive slush fund scandal, Cardinal Kim condemned it in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúWhat truly damages the people‚Äôs dignity is not just corruption itself, but a regime that tries to conceal it‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. In a society where many religious leaders sought to remain ‚Äòapolitical,‚Äô he challenged that notion, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever the face of humanity disappears, the Church must speak.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs resistance was rooted in a theology of suffering, not ideology. ‚ÄúIf there is no God, then suffering has no meaning. But if God exists, then suffering becomes the place where meaning is born,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. He was no stranger to despair. He wept with grieving mothers and stood beside the tortured, yet he transformed their agony into prayer. ‚ÄúThrough suffering,‚Äù one widow told him years after her husband‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI drew nearer to God. My pain became an offering of praise.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs greatness lay not in political power or institutional strength, but in the quiet force of conscience. He did not seek the spotlight, yet he became the most trusted public figure of his generation. When he died, more than 400,000 people came to mourn him‚Äînot out of ritual, but because they had seen in him what a moral life could look like. He showed that even under dictatorship, truth could still be spoken, love still embodied, and faith still enacted.
</p>
<p>
He believed that the Church must not only answer to God‚Äîit must also answer to the people of this land. This belief, lived out with courage and compassion, made Cardinal Kim not only a shepherd of souls, but a father of democracy.

<p>
In the 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Ko Young-geun emerged as a prophetic Christian leader who fearlessly confronted South Korea‚Äôs authoritarian regimes. His pastoral identity was grounded in social justice and eschatological faith, which he expressed through both theological commitment and direct political resistance. By the late 1970s, after multiple imprisonments for violating Emergency Measure No.&nbsp;9, he became convinced that ‚Äúpersonal goodness was powerless before structural evil‚Äù and expanded his pastoral practice ‚Äúfrom saving individual souls to addressing systemic injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Ko directed his resistance toward the Chun Doo-hwan regime. A defining moment was his sermon titled <em>‚ÄúThe Blood-Cry of the Martyred Patriots‚Äù</em> delivered during the second anniversary memorial of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1982. In this sermon, he directly called Chun a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù accused the U.S. of ‚Äúcomplicity in the massacre,‚Äù and urged the Korean church to repent for remaining silent.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> This was more than a spiritual message‚Äîit was a public declaration of moral judgment, amplifying the political responsibilities of both state and religious institutions. His radical sermon led to police detention and the arrest of several co-organizers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ko emphasized that love without justice and justice without love were both distortions of Christian truth. In the 1980s, he worked through informal clerical gatherings, the Association of Clergy for Fair Media, and political prisoner release campaigns, where he prioritized ‚Äúdemocratic decision-making and mutual respect among clergy and laypeople alike.‚Äù<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, Ko turned his attention to supporting unconverted long-term prisoners (ÎπÑÏ†ÑÌñ• Ïû•Í∏∞Ïàò), many of whom were former North Korean operatives imprisoned for decades. Ko argued that true reunification must come ‚Äúafter democratization‚Äù and that Christian reunification must be rooted in ‚Äúlove as the foundation.‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Through letter exchanges with the prisoners, he shed light on the forced conversion system and reinterpreted their ‚Äúconversion, human rights, and faith transformation‚Äù as theological and ethical issues. This ministry, largely neglected by mainstream churches, ‚Äúopened a space for Christian engagement in reconciliation and national healing.‚Äù<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, his activism was controversial. However, his ministry showed that prophetic theology could bridge social justice and gospel proclamation. As Prof.&nbsp;Choi Young-geun noted, Ko‚Äôs theology was ‚Äúa lived theology of gospel resistance rooted in the quest for national democratization, church reform, and social purification,‚Äù grounded in a vision of Christian nationalism that upheld universal justice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
His consistent proclamation‚Äîthat true gospel must include justice and solidarity with the oppressed‚Äîremains a powerful theological legacy, urging the Korean church today to recover its historical responsibility and public witness.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical period in which Kim Young-sam stood at the forefront of democratic resistance against authoritarianism, grounded in a profound Christian faith. During this time, his political actions were not only expressions of opposition to military regimes but also embodied a model of Christian conviction in the public sphere. His leadership helped shape the identity of Korean Christianity as socially engaged and morally driven.
</p>
<p>
One of the most symbolic moments was his 23-day hunger strike in 1983, a dramatic protest against the military dictatorship. Kim later confessed that this act would have been impossible without his faith, declaring, ‚ÄúIt was an obedience to the mission given by God.‚Äù He emphasized that unless democracy was restored, he could not even bring himself to eat. This reveals the deep theological conviction underpinning his political resistance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His hunger strike deeply resonated within the Christian community. Many Protestant leaders viewed Kim as a ‚Äúman of faith in politics,‚Äù and his example of spiritual discipline reinforced the bond between him and conservative Protestant circles. One anecdote illustrates how he would lead mountain-climbing sessions through the Democratic Alpine Club with prayer and hymn-singing, praying, ‚ÄúLet the river of freedom flow.‚Äù This ritual reflects how his activism was a natural extension of his faith life<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian media and national outlets portrayed Kim‚Äôs actions as a faith-based movement for political reform, emphasizing his spiritual grounding in the democratization movement. These activities in the 1980s laid the foundation for the symbolic identity of the ‚ÄúPresbyterian president‚Äù in the 1992 presidential election. This label went beyond religious affiliation; it represented a moral and theological ideal of democracy rooted in Christian ethics<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, his example offered legitimacy to political engagement among conservative Protestant churches. By sanctifying Kim‚Äôs actions as expressions of Christian faith, the Protestant establishment paved the way for initiatives like the founding of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) and the rise of national prayer rallies, solidifying the trajectory of conservative Christianity toward political activism.
</p>
<p>
In summary, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political resistance in the 1980s was not merely strategic but a manifestation of lived Christian faith. His actions inspired many believers to reconsider the relationship between faith and politics and opened new paths for public theology and civic engagement in the Korean church. He presented a model for how Christianity could be lived out in the pursuit of justice, and in doing so, he reshaped the narrative of Christian involvement in Korea‚Äôs democratization.

<p>
During the turbulent decade of the 1980s, Han Kyungjik emerged as one of the most strategically influential yet spiritually grounded Christian leaders in South Korea, weaving together evangelism, social service, ecumenical leadership, and humanitarian outreach into a singular pastoral vocation. His actions were not mere reiterations of past strategies but deliberate engagements with the rapidly shifting religious and political conditions of a nation under authoritarian rule and capitalist transformation.
</p>
<p>
His presence at the center of national evangelization campaigns exemplified his lifelong commitment to reaching the Korean people with the gospel, not just individually, but collectively and publicly. As honorary chairman of major revival meetings such as the 1980 and 1985 National Evangelization Crusades, Han lent spiritual authority and unity to movements that sought to transform the moral fabric of the nation. These campaigns, organized through trans-denominational cooperation and often with military and governmental support, moved beyond typical revivalism to embody what Han called a ‚Äúmovement of national purification through the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. The emphasis was not only on salvation but on renewing the Korean identity under Christian values.
</p>
<p>
When the industrial mission movement reached a breaking point in 1983, Han was forced to make one of the most painful decisions of his ministry. Initially launched to bring the gospel to the laborers in Korea‚Äôs burgeoning industrial complexes, the mission had grown increasingly aligned with labor rights activism and progressive theology. Conservative leaders accused it of harboring Marxist sympathies, while progressive pastors defended it as the ethical application of the gospel. In the midst of this debate, Yeongnak Church withdrew financial support, signaling Han‚Äôs reluctant yet pragmatic disengagement from a now politicized cause<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. His silence was not without cost: it alienated some younger pastors and marked a rift between the evangelical mainstream and radicalized Christian social activism.
</p>
<p>
He redirected attention to the military field, where his earlier vision of evangelizing soldiers matured into a nationwide chaplaincy network supported by the state. Han had described the military as Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Fishing Ground‚Äù for evangelism, following the 1966 Berlin World Congress on Evangelism. During the 1980s, this vision materialized into structured programs of religious education in barracks, regular worship services in training camps, and increasing collaboration between church leadership and military institutions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Far from being a peripheral activity, military evangelization became a sanctioned form of spiritual nationalism, one that fortified anti-communist ideology with Christian discipline.
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs leadership in the 1984 Protestant Centennial events further showcased his ecumenical balancing act. Despite theological tensions within the Korean church‚Äîespecially between the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Churches‚ÄîHan served as the symbolic head of the organizing committee. The rallies, which included massive public gatherings in Seoul and other cities, emphasized repentance, national unity, and mission renewal. Han‚Äôs message in these moments focused on healing the division not only between North and South, but within the church itself. His stature as a theologically moderate and morally unblemished elder enabled him to maintain trust across polarized camps<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most daring proposal came in 1987‚Äì88, when he publicly called for South Korean churches to send surplus rice to famine-stricken North Korea. This act, which would become a precursor to broader humanitarian engagement, was rooted in pastoral memory and Christian conscience. Having grown up in the North and witnessed its devastation, Han felt a deep sense of indebtedness toward its people. His call for unofficial aid‚Äîcarried out through church networks rather than government agencies‚Äîdemonstrated a rare fusion of evangelical piety and political sensitivity. He distinguished his proposal from pro-North ideology by grounding it in the gospel‚Äôs call to love enemies and feed the hungry<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>. It also opened theological space for conservative Christians to imagine cross-border ministry without betraying their anti-communist commitments.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this decade, Han maintained and expanded Yeongnak Church‚Äôs vast welfare operations, demonstrating that evangelism without compassion was a contradiction in terms. His initiatives ranged from the Yeongnak Bo-rinwon orphanage to elderly care centers, women‚Äôs shelters, and community health clinics. These were not merely institutional charities; they were expressions of his conviction that ‚Äúthe church must follow Christ not only to the pulpit, but to the streets and margins‚Äù<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Unlike other megachurch leaders who aligned social work with branding, Han‚Äôs ministry operated in humility, guided by a theology of incarnation and service.
</p>
<p>
In all these endeavors, Han Kyungjik‚Äôs legacy in the 1980s defies categorization. He was not only a revivalist, nor merely a humanitarian. His vision integrated spiritual renewal with public engagement, personal faith with collective responsibility. Amidst rising authoritarianism, economic upheaval, and theological conflict, Han stood as a centering force‚Äîfirm yet gentle, conservative yet compassionate, evangelical yet inclusive.

<p>
Even before becoming president, Kim Dae-jung stood at the epicenter of Korea‚Äôs modern democratic struggle, and the 1980s marked the most perilous and transformative decade of his life. Following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, South Korea entered a brief period of political liberalization known as the ‚ÄúSeoul Spring.‚Äù Yet this promise of democracy was quickly hijacked by Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs military faction, who staged a multi-phase coup and sought to eliminate all opposition by labeling Kim Dae-jung the mastermind of a fabricated insurrection plot.
</p>
<p>
On May 17, 1980, Chun‚Äôs military government declared martial law nationwide and arrested Kim Dae-jung, accusing him of attempting to incite revolution in collaboration with student demonstrators. This ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung Rebellion Conspiracy Case‚Äù was the centerpiece of Chun‚Äôs strategy to justify the violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising and to seize power under the guise of protecting national security. As Professor Choi Jung-ki explains, ‚ÄúThe two distinct events‚ÄîKim‚Äôs alleged rebellion and the Gwangju massacre‚Äîwere deliberately linked by the military regime‚Äôs fabricated narrative in order to justify its coup and delegitimize civilian resistance‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Through military tribunals devoid of due process and conducted under torture-driven investigations, Kim was sentenced to death in 1980. The trial was not a legal proceeding but ‚Äúa political theater orchestrated to remove a key civilian opponent of the emerging military dictatorship‚Äù<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. Only through intense international pressure from the United States, the Vatican, and human rights organizations was his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, then reduced further, leading to his release and exile in the United States
</p>
<p>
During his exile from 1982, Kim Dae-jung continued to articulate the cause of Korean democracy on the global stage. Yet it was in his prison years that his Christian identity took on its most profound form. In his <em>Letters from Prison</em>, Kim wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing Jesus means bearing the cross‚Äîthat is, standing with the suffering, fighting against injustice, and opposing the powerful. That inevitably draws the hatred and persecution of the privileged‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. For Kim, faith was not a private belief but a public commitment to truth, justice, and love for the oppressed. He described Jesus not only as Savior but as ‚Äúthe liberator of the oppressed and the martyr executed as a political prisoner‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His prison writings articulate a theology of ‚Äúsocial salvation‚Äù grounded in the dual pursuit of personal redemption and collective liberation. ‚ÄúTrue Christian faith must unite personal salvation with social salvation,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWithout both, we cannot claim to have real faith‚Äù<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. While many churches in Korea focused solely on individual piety, Kim called on Christians to transform society and confront injustice: ‚ÄúIf Christianity is truly to follow Jesus, it must fight not only personal sin but social evils as well‚Äù<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His return to Korea in 1985‚Äîdespite the threat of renewed repression‚Äîmarked another turning point. Immediately detained upon arrival, his treatment sparked global condemnation. Yet Kim persisted, becoming a spiritual and political compass for the Korean opposition. His decision not to run in the 1987 presidential election, despite being a leading candidate, revealed a political ethic rooted not in ambition but in national unity and moral discernment.
</p>
<p>
To the end, Kim Dae-jung insisted that his political career was inseparable from his faith. ‚ÄúIf there were no God,‚Äù he once said, ‚Äúthere would be no Kim Dae-jung worth listening to‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. His democratic ideals, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his vision for a unified Korea were all expressions of his belief in a living God who stands with the oppressed. In the words of the theologian Choi Doo-hyun, ‚ÄúKim Dae-jung walked the path of Thomas More. He was a scandal to the Korean church and nation‚Äîprecisely because he defied the divisions of politics and religion, of Protestants and Catholics, of conservatives and progressives‚Äù<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the 1980s were a crucible through which Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs theology, politics, and public life were fused into a singular mission. Against torture, false charges, and death, he bore witness to a faith that refused to retreat into private spirituality. Instead, he lived a public theology‚Äîa discipleship that bore the wounds of a nation struggling for truth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kim Dae-jung vs.&nbsp;Kim Young-sam in the 1980s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of a comparative analysis with Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs long-time political rival and eventual fellow president, is particularly meaningful in this context. While both figures emerged as central leaders of the pro-democracy movement during the 1980s, their experiences, strategies, and expressions of faith took markedly different forms. A comparison between the two offers deeper insight into the diverse pathways that shaped Korea‚Äôs democratic transition‚Äîone marked by international advocacy and theological reflection, the other by institutional reform and ethical conservatism.
</p>
<p>
To highlight these contrasts, the following two tables are provided. The first table presents a parallel timeline of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam‚Äôs major political and personal milestones throughout the decade, allowing readers to trace how their lives intersected and diverged under military rule. The second table offers an integrated thematic comparison, exploring their differences across key dimensions such as religious identity, political persecution, leadership style, and democratic legacy. Together, these tables illuminate the complementary and conflicting roles that both men played in Korea‚Äôs path to democracy‚Äîrevealing not just a rivalry, but a dynamic tension between two contrasting visions of political and moral leadership.

<p>
The 1980s marked a critical era in which David Yonggi Cho‚Äôs leadership elevated Yoido Full Gospel Church to become the largest single congregation in the world. More than a symbol of rapid church expansion, Cho redefined Korean Protestantism by introducing an unprecedented theological, organizational, and social paradigm. By 1984, Yoido Full Gospel Church had surpassed 400,000 registered members. Its explosive growth was supported by Cho‚Äôs innovations such as the home cell system and lay leadership development, which institutionalized the role of ordinary believers as active evangelists and spiritual caregivers<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of Cho‚Äôs theology were the Fivefold Gospel (salvation, fullness of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, blessing, and the Second Coming) and the Threefold Blessing (spiritual, physical, and material prosperity). These doctrines offered hope to a war-scarred, poverty-stricken society and appealed to the Korean public‚Äôs longing for restoration and wholeness<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>. However, these messages attracted fierce criticism. Conservative theologians in Korea, particularly from the Presbyterian Church, denounced Cho‚Äôs teachings as mystical, self-centered, and doctrinally unsound. Professor Hyung-Ryong Park of Chongshin University argued that Cho‚Äôs doctrine of Spirit baptism contradicted Reformed theology‚Äôs understanding of regeneration<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs sermons centered on experiential healing and restoration. He proclaimed that hell was not only a future destiny but also present in the daily suffering of the Korean people. ‚ÄúThe message of 3 John 1:2,‚Äù he often said, ‚Äúdeclares that we must be well in body and life just as our soul prospers‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>. His leadership style was transcendental‚Äîbased on vision, divine calling, and prayer. He believed that the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling was indispensable for any church to thrive. His strategic direction combined military-style administration with spiritual passion, earning both acclaim and controversy<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) issued an official warning, essentially labeling Cho‚Äôs theology heretical. The core reasons were his doctrinal stance on Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and his emphasis on material prosperity. In response, Cho strengthened his theological base through institutions like the International Theological Institute and Hansei University<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Internationally, evangelical media outlets in the United States accused him of promoting an ‚Äúoccult healing‚Äù gospel. Others labeled his theology as ‚ÄúNew Age Christianity.‚Äù Nonetheless, Cho defended his teachings as biblically grounded and spiritually fruitful<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Cho gained recognition within mainstream Christianity. In 1984, he was invited as the keynote speaker for the Korean Christian Centennial Mission Conference. By the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Full Gospel denomination joined the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), marking the integration of Cho‚Äôs ministry into the Protestant mainstream<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>. He also expanded social ministries, founded Christian newspapers, and launched global missions. By 1990, Yoido Full Gospel Church had dispatched over 700 missionaries abroad, positioning itself as a center of global Pentecostal outreach<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1980s for David Yonggi Cho represent a multifaceted legacy‚Äîmassive church growth, public influence, doctrinal debate, institutional development, and the reinvention of Korean Pentecostal identity.

<p>
The 1980s marked a pivotal decade in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Kwon Ho-kyung, who stood at the forefront of Korea‚Äôs ecumenical social mission, responding to the demands of his era through grassroots engagement with the urban poor, resistance against authoritarian rule, advocacy for laborers and marginalized communities, and a prophetic vision for peace on the Korean Peninsula. His life and work were not merely personal achievements, but testimonies to a historic moment when Korean Protestantism turned its face toward the people and history itself.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon served as the secretary of the Urban-Rural Mission Committee (URM) of the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA). Through this role, he actively participated in the global URM movement, which empowered workers, peasants, and the poor across the developing world to gain political and social consciousness. His ministry bridged the Korean context with broader international efforts, embodying a practical theology of liberation. As a second-generation URM practitioner, he succeeded the path of pioneers such as Cho Seung-hyuk and Jo Ji-song and contributed to shaping an ecumenical network that grounded democratic development in mission theology.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1988, the Korean National Council of Churches (NCCK) published the historic ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Church on National Unification and Peace‚Äù (commonly known as the ‚Äú‚Äô88 Declaration‚Äù), which Rev.&nbsp;Kwon helped author and promote. This statement represented a theological breakthrough in which the Korean church articulated a unified and peaceful vision for the divided peninsula. After being elected as General Secretary of NCCK in 1989, he led direct efforts toward North-South church exchanges and reconciliation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The apex of these efforts came in January 1992, when Rev.&nbsp;Kwon and Dr.&nbsp;Kyung-seo Park visited North Korea at the invitation of the Korean Christian Federation. It was the first official visit by a Korean church leader since division. Rev.&nbsp;Kwon preached at Bongsu Church on January 12 with a sermon titled ‚ÄúJesus Christ Who Makes Us One,‚Äù based on Ephesians 2:13‚Äì18, proclaiming reconciliation through the gospel. On January 13, he also met with Kim Il-sung to discuss potential joint North-South church activities, including a proposed Jubilee declaration for the 50th anniversary of division in 1995.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Though the South Korean government blocked the participation of North Korean representatives at the 1992 NCCK assembly, Rev.&nbsp;Kwon continued to advocate for peace through subsequent initiatives such as the Korean Sharing Movement and human-chain events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These were not abstract diplomatic events, but the lived theology of a man who had endured imprisonment, surveillance, and suppression under the Yushin regime. His resistance was rooted in the gospel and shaped by the suffering of urban poor communities in Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns and apartments. He was not merely a critic of authoritarianism but a builder of grassroots democratic structures. As his memoirs recount, his work in organizations like the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Mission Committee connected him to tenant unions, labor rights struggles, and broader movements for justice across Korea‚Äôs rapidly industrializing society.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During his time as General Secretary of NCCK, he also mediated internal disputes among denominations, navigating a tense environment where ecumenical cooperation was often threatened by church politics. Notably, his appointment came after a failed nomination of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Sang-geun, and later, when he moved to become president of CBS (Christian Broadcasting System), the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK) temporarily withdrew from NCCK in protest. The controversy reflected broader debates about transparency, fairness, and representativeness within ecumenical structures, all of which Kwon had to confront and respond to with institutional reform.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Kwon‚Äôs 1980s ministry thus integrated the tears of the people, the longing for reunification, the global ecumenical movement, and internal church reform into a single unified vision. His testimony‚Äî‚ÄúWhat remained in every trial, whether in police stations, courts, or under martial law, was not power or wealth, but people. History flows where people hope‚Äù‚Äîcontinues to resonate as a theological and pastoral insight that the Korean church must reclaim today.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>

Rev.&nbsp;Choi Sung-mook emerged as a key pastoral and civic leader in Busan during the critical years spanning the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, standing at the forefront of democratization efforts against the Yushin dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
During the late 1970s, as the Yushin system tightened its grip, Choi served as the pastor of Jungbu Church and transformed it into a hub not only for worship but also for justice and democratic resistance. In 1978, he launched the Good Book Cooperative Movement (Yangseo Hyupdong Johap) with the church‚Äôs youth group‚Äîa movement that quickly evolved beyond reading circles into a public sphere of civic enlightenment and critical social reflection<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. By 1979, the cooperative had grown to 570 members, and many of its participants became involved in or inspired by the Busan-Masan Democracy Protests (Buma Uprising)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Buma Uprising, which erupted on October 16, 1979, in Busan and spread to Masan, was a large-scale civic revolt against the Yushin regime‚Äîmarking the first popular uprising to directly threaten the system‚Äôs survival. Students and citizens took to the streets shouting ‚ÄúAbolish Yushin!‚Äù and soon clashed with police and government buildings<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The protests were fueled by public anger over constitutional repression, emergency decrees, and worsening economic inequality, exacerbated by the expulsion of opposition leader Kim Young-sam and regional economic decline<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. The uprising culminated in President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs assassination on October 26, effectively ending the Yushin regime.
</p>
<p>
In response, the military regime labeled the cooperative as the uprising‚Äôs ideological base, arresting more than 300 members. Even after the group was forcibly dissolved, former members continued their involvement in the democratization movement. This led to the Burim Incident of 1981, a fabricated espionage case in which 22 students, teachers, and office workers were arrested without warrants and tortured into confessing to alleged violations of the National Security Law<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>. It became one of the most notorious political purges of the early Chun Doo-hwan era.
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;Choi himself was also targeted during this period. Intelligence officers accused him of having received direct instructions from North Korea‚Äôs Kim Il-sung to incite the uprising‚Äîa clear example of the regime‚Äôs ideological paranoia<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. Undeterred, Choi redirected his efforts in 1984 to organize the Korea Pollution Problems Institute ‚Äì Busan Branch (KPII), expanding the focus of civic resistance from politics to environmental justice. He framed pollution not merely as a local nuisance, but as ‚Äúa social evil rooted in national and structural contradictions,‚Äù advocating for a convergence of scientific expertise, ethical theology, and grassroots activism<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Choi‚Äôs initiative evolved into the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (1985) and later the Citizens‚Äô Coalition to Eradicate Pollution (1989), culminating in the establishment of the Busan Environmental Movement Union in the 1990s. His work redefined environmental action as a form of human rights advocacy and public discipleship. Rather than retreating into religious neutrality, Choi embedded his pastoral vocation within the broader project of democratization and social transformation. For this, he is remembered not only as a pastor, but as a foundational figure in Busan‚Äôs civic and democratic infrastructure.

Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park emerged as a representative figure who broke down the boundaries between church and society, pulpit and protest, during a time when democratization and urban poor movements converged in 1980s South Korea. He believed the church could no longer maintain a passive stance distant from power and must instead stand in solidarity with the oppressed and suffering people to realize justice and peace. His actions during this period were more than mere participation‚Äîthey became symbolic events demonstrating how religion could intersect with social justice.
</p>
<p>
Following the Gwangju Uprising in 1980, Park sharpened his understanding of the military regime‚Äôs nature and expanded his solidarity with the democratization movement. He collaborated closely with reformist pastors within the Korean Methodist Church and progressive ecumenical groups such as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice and the Korean Christian Youth Association. Notably, he played a key role in forming the National Movement Headquarters for Democratic Constitution (commonly known as <em>Kukbon</em>) in May 1986. Through the Seoul regional chapter, Park actively bridged the divide between church and street, sanctuary and square.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In June 1987, as the democracy movement culminated in mass protests and sit-ins, Park became a central supporter of the occupation of Myeongdong Cathedral, a major turning point in the movement. At a time when the regime was attempting to suppress civil resistance through crackdowns on nationwide organizations‚Äîincluding labor groups, teachers‚Äô unions in formation, and pro-democracy alliances‚ÄîPark provided material and moral support. He opened Seoul Jeil Church as a secure meeting space for democratic organizers and offered refuge to activists at risk. ‚ÄúPrayer and action cannot be separated. We must cling to the Word and step into the streets,‚Äù he declared, underscoring the necessity of faith in action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Park‚Äôs participation was not merely political‚Äîit was theological. He frequently quoted John 16:33, proclaiming, ‚ÄúJesus was one who fought against the world. So must we.‚Äù<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> In his sermons, he often declared, ‚ÄúPeace is not given through prayer alone. There can be no peace without struggle.‚Äù<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> Grounded in this theological conviction, Park aligned himself with contemporary theological streams such as Minjung theology and liberation theology, defending Christian engagement in democratization against conservative criticism within the church.
</p>
<p>
Theologian Kim Myung-bae assessed Park‚Äôs contributions by noting that ‚Äúas a Christian and a pastor, Park was one of the rare leaders who embodied a theology of social engagement through action,‚Äù and that his efforts ‚Äúhad a significant impact on the advancement of South Korean democracy in the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Park‚Äôs solidarity was not simply a political choice‚Äîit was a theological turning point that redefined how the church could relate to society and practice the Gospel.

Bishop Tji Hak-soun‚Äôs activities in the 1980s symbolized the Catholic Church‚Äôs model of public responsibility and timely intervention in society. Firmly believing that the Church must not remain merely a place of consolation but become a living agent of liberation and justice for the suffering, he embodied the idea that the Church should become ‚Äúthe face of Christ‚Äù in the world. His ministry transcended local pastoral work and resonated as a profound theological and social testimony for the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
His imprisonment during the 1974 Mincheonghakryeon (National Federation of Democratic Youth and Students) incident was not merely a matter of personal conscience, but a public witness to the Church‚Äôs calling in an oppressive era. It was said that ‚Äúhe offered prayers and Masses with the faithful to eliminate corruption and led the democratization movement,‚Äù showing that the Church‚Äôs neutrality could yield to the demand for justice<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. His arrest led directly to the formation of the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ), which became the driving force behind the Catholic Church‚Äôs active role in Korea‚Äôs democratization movement throughout the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
His commitment to social engagement was not a political detour but a faithful response to the identity of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council. Having participated in the final session of the Council in 1965, Bishop Tji internalized its teachings and sought to embody them fully. He once stated, ‚ÄúPriests must deeply study the basic spirit of the Second Vatican Council and all the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, and faithfully implement their teachings in this year‚Äôs pastoral goals‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. His life, in its entirety, was a testimony to the Council‚Äôs call for a Church of solidarity and justice in the modern world<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He opposed the authoritarian development-first policies of the Park Chung-hee regime by siding with the oppressed. His work in organizing cooperatives, founding grassroots schools, and responding to regional disasters was not charity, but an effort to help the poor become active agents of change<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. In his eyes, they were not passive recipients of aid but participants in their own liberation.
</p>
<p>
Among his most important achievements in the 1980s was his role in launching a civilization alternative rooted in life and ecology. Collaborating with the Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement, he promoted organic farming, local markets, and the establishment of producer-consumer solidarity. This eventually gave rise to the Hansalim Movement. As one account states, ‚ÄúBishop Tji, along with Fr.&nbsp;Choi Ki-sik and Jang Il-soon, promoted the movement in Seoul parishes through sermons and lectures, leading to its gradual spread‚Äù<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His activism was grounded in the Catholic notion of ‚ÄúIntegral Human Development,‚Äù which connects economic, political, and ecological justice. He emphasized the interconnection of human beings, society, and all of creation<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. Opposing anthropocentric utilitarianism, he demanded ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù that changes one‚Äôs lifestyle<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. This vision directly anticipates Pope Francis‚Äôs teaching on integral ecology in <em>Laudato Si‚Äô</em>.
</p>
<p>
Tji‚Äôs theology was not abstract speculation, but a lived theology of solidarity. He rejected clerical centrism and called for ‚Äúthe decentering of the Church for the sake of Christ and humanity‚Äù<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. In doing so, he embodied the Church not as an institution for itself but as the sacrament of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tji Hak-soun was a prophetic pastor who sought to restore the Church‚Äôs vocation in a dark era. His life is a record of sacrifice‚Äîseeing the world through the eyes of the poor, walking in the footsteps of Christ, and renewing the Church through service and courage.

<p>
The 1980s marked a decisive turning point in the life and thought of Kim Ji-ha (1941‚Äì2022), one of South Korea‚Äôs most renowned dissident poets. After spending nearly six years in prison under the Yushin regime, Kim re-emerged not as the same revolutionary bard of the 1970s, but as a thinker committed to a broader vision of life‚Äîwhat he came to call <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> (the philosophy of life). This transformation was not only intellectual but spiritual, involving a reorientation away from institutional Catholicism and toward a syncretic spirituality rooted in Donghak, ecology, and grassroots practice.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs post-prison years began with a profound engagement with Catholic social teachings. In the early 1980s, he worked closely with <em>Jang Il-soon</em> and <em>Bishop Ji Hak-soon</em> in the Wonju diocese, which had become a hub for Christian-based civic resistance. Kim studied the documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals, especially those concerning labor and social justice. He described these texts as being ‚Äúcalm on the surface, but filled with inner tension, debate, and the weight of 2,000 years of organizational refinement‚Äù<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. His participation in the study group at the Wonju Catholic Center contributed to the intellectual foundation of his later writings, including the 1981 report <em>‚ÄúThe Expansion of the Cooperative Life and the Worldview of Life‚Äù</em>, a joint project with the Wonju Group, which included Jang Il-soon, Catholic activists, and other intellectuals<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet Kim‚Äôs journey soon led beyond Catholic orthodoxy. While grateful for the resources and insights it provided, he eventually moved toward a more autonomous spiritual orientation, fusing ecological awareness, Eastern thought, and Korean folk spirituality. In one well-known anecdote, Kim told Bishop Ji:
</p>
<p>
<em>‚ÄúI am returning to my hometown.‚Äù</em><br> <em>‚ÄúWhere, Mokpo?‚Äù</em><br> <em>‚ÄúNo, Donghak.‚Äù</em><br> <em>‚ÄúYou mean Cheondogyo?‚Äù</em><br> ‚ÄúNo, my own inner Donghak.‚Äù<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Kim named this internal shift ‚ÄúWon Donghak‚Äù (Original Donghak)‚Äîa revival of Donghak values not as institutional religion but as an ethical cosmology focused on coexistence, ecological balance, and mutual survival. In doing so, he distanced himself from both traditional church structures and materialist Marxism, charting a course that fused religious imagination with radical democratic ecological ethics.
</p>
<p>
His ecological vision, articulated in texts like <em>‚ÄúI Am Rice‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúThe Song of the Southern Boat‚Äù</em>, and <em>‚ÄúThe Carrier of Life: The Minjung‚Äù</em>, offered a new framework for Korean <em>minjung</em> discourse. For Kim, the <em>minjung</em> were not merely a political class or oppressed proletariat but the bearers of <em>life</em> (<em>saengmyeong</em>), connected not just to each other but to the earth and cosmos<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation had a ripple effect across Korean society. First, within Catholic social movements, Kim‚Äôs departure from institutional religion while upholding its social mission challenged clergy and lay leaders alike to rethink the nature of religious commitment. His turn to Donghak‚Äî‚Äúmy own inner Donghak‚Äù‚Äîprovoked a new discourse on spirituality as lived practice rather than dogma, and on ethics beyond institutional religion<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. It inspired socially engaged Catholics to explore ways of continuing public witness even outside the Church‚Äôs boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Second, among progressive intellectuals and activist circles, Kim‚Äôs redefinition of <em>minjung</em> as bearers of life, not merely class consciousness, catalyzed a major ideological shift. The term came to encompass farmers, women, nature, and even microorganisms‚Äîa framework that seeded the development of <em>minjung ecology</em>, regional cooperative movements, and spiritual activism in rural communities<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in South Korean society at large, Kim Ji-ha‚Äôs <em>saengmyeong sasang</em> contributed to a broader turn toward ecology, simplicity, and post-industrial values. The Hansalim Cooperative, the consumer-based <em>saenghwal undong</em> (life movement), and early versions of Korea‚Äôs environmental ethics all bear traces of Kim‚Äôs influence<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. His insistence that ‚Äúa revolution must also be spiritual‚Äù extended beyond literature and theology, embedding itself in practical ethics, agriculture, and education.
</p>
<p>
While he did not formally renounce Catholicism, his departure from ecclesiastical affiliation and embrace of what he called <em>‚Äúa creative, revolutionary faith rooted in Korean tradition and the life force of the cosmos‚Äù</em> signaled a paradigm shift in Korean progressive religious thought<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.

In the 1980s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo played a pivotal role as the director of the Cheongshijpja Medical Insurance Cooperative, bringing Korea‚Äôs first community-based nonprofit health insurance model to maturity. By 1988, the cooperative had reached over 230,000 active members and a cumulative enrollment of approximately 530,000 people, operating contracts with 483 clinics and hospitals across Korea.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Prior to the launch of Korea‚Äôs National Health Insurance in 1989, it effectively served as the public health system for the Busan region.
</p>
<p>
Founded on a Christian ethic of compassion and social justice, the cooperative implemented a participatory and democratic governance structure. Premiums were not calculated based on age, gender, or medical risk. ‚ÄúAnyone could join and withdraw from the cooperative regardless of religion or class,‚Äù making it one of the most inclusive healthcare models of its time<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. All key decisions were made through unanimous voting at the general assembly of member-elected delegates, a system that ‚Äúensured accountability and direct participation in every major policy decision‚Äù<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dr.&nbsp;Jang published regular editorials in the cooperative‚Äôs newsletter and consistently reaffirmed its spiritual foundation. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe Cheongshijpja movement seeks to overcome suffering through cooperation and to live meaningfully, for the benefit of society and the nation. It is a movement that turns away from selfishness and toward truth‚Äù<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The cooperative prefigured solutions to many challenges that still plague South Korea‚Äôs health system today. To control moral hazard, it introduced co-payments, contractual oversight of providers, penalties for fraudulent claims, and a tiered fee structure. Outpatient services had a 40‚Äì50% copayment, and patients accessing out-of-area hospitals were charged an additional 30%<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the cooperative was dissolved in 1989, 62 out of its 63 staff members were integrated into the newly created local offices of the National Health Insurance Service, transferring their operational know-how. Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs leadership represents a rare fusion of Christian vocation, social innovation, and institutional impact, proving that even in the 1980s, his work remained socially transformative and forward-looking.

In the 1980s, Ahn Byung-mu expanded minjung theology beyond resistance to dictatorship, developing a new framework for peace, reunification, and social theology. Although dismissed again from Hanshin University under Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs regime, he continued writing and lecturing as an emeritus professor. In 1987, he published <em>Stories of Minjung Theology</em> and other key works that consolidated his theological system.
</p>
<p>
During this period, Ahn integrated the issue of Korean reunification into minjung theology. His posthumously published collection <em>Korean National Movement and Reunification</em> developed a vision of reunification grounded in minjung agency. He challenged state-centered approaches and asserted that ‚Äútrue unification must come from the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> He structured his reunification theology as a narrative arc: awakening to unification (<em>ki</em>), overcoming anti-unification forces (<em>seung</em>), emergence of minjung as agents (<em>jeon</em>), and realizing peace through minjung (<em>gyeol</em>).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ahn‚Äôs most striking development in this era was his deepening of <em>minjung messianism</em>. He envisioned minjung not as mere victims, but as active bearers of historical liberation. In resonance with Jacques Derrida‚Äôs idea of <em>the messianic without messianism</em>, he argued that minjung messiah ‚Äúdoes not demand obedience to doctrine or ideology but invites us into the space of suffering to ask questions about justice and liberation.‚Äù<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This was not just theological innovation but philosophical intervention.

Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon stood as a central figure of Korea‚Äôs evangelical movement during the 1980s, orchestrating a holistic gospel campaign that unified evangelism with social responsibility. Expanding from the urban-focused Holy City Movement (Seongshihwa Undong) he had initiated in the 1970s, Kim advanced a strategic model that aimed to evangelize cities, transform the nation, and ultimately contribute to world evangelization. His signature slogan‚Äî‚Äúthe whole church delivering the whole gospel to the whole city‚Äù‚Äîreflected a theological and practical vision for societal transformation through evangelism.
</p>
<p>
Kim launched the Holy City Movement in 1972 in Chuncheon, modeling it after John Calvin‚Äôs Geneva and the martyrdom-based ministry of Evangelist Moon Jun-kyung. Calvin‚Äôs Geneva was, in his view, an ideal city governed by the sovereignty of God, where churches and city councils cooperated to educate citizens based on biblical values. Likewise, Moon Jun-kyung embodied what Kim called a ‚Äúsubstitute beggar,‚Äù a servant who not only preached but fulfilled people‚Äôs daily needs with sacrificial love<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Kim further expanded this model into a nationwide and global evangelistic initiative. Through the ‚ÄúEXPO ‚Äô80‚Äù World Evangelization Crusade, he ignited a vision of both national and global evangelization among youth and university students. This campaign laid the foundation for a broader reunification movement that addressed the wounds of national division. In 1995, at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE), he initiated the ‚Äú100,000 University Student Reunification Volunteer Corps,‚Äù embodying his conviction that spiritual renewal must accompany national healing<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs emphasis on social responsibility also deepened in this decade. His campaigns included the ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Long Johns Project,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOrgan Donation Campaign,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCoal Briquette Sharing Movement,‚Äù free meal services, and hospice care ministries for the poor and ill.&nbsp;In 1996, he launched the ‚ÄúFood Bank‚Äù movement, advocating the biblical principle that ‚Äúthe right to live surpasses the right to property‚Äù in order to address hunger and famine in North Korea<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>. By 2007, he initiated the ‚ÄúNorth Korea Dairy Goat Campaign,‚Äù in which CCC staff and students pledged to send over 10,000 goats (worth approximately 3 billion KRW) to starving families in the North<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology was rooted in Reformed traditions but expanded through evangelical interactions, particularly with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a planning committee member of the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Kim embodied the Lausanne Covenant‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúboth the authority of the inerrant Scriptures and the Christian‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù He consistently modeled what he called the ‚ÄúWhole Gospel‚Äù‚Äîa unified ministry of evangelism and justice<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This theological vision was integrated into his ministry strategy. He defined national evangelization not merely as preaching but as a threefold process: preaching the gospel to all people, training believers as disciples, and transforming all sectors of society until ‚ÄúChrist becomes Lord of all.‚Äù He declared this ‚ÄúJesus Revolution‚Äù in his New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast in 1970 and launched a decades-long movement to actualize it through CCC and the Holy City Movement<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Jun-gon‚Äôs ministry in the 1980s represented a convergence of evangelistic fervor, social compassion, and missiological strategy. Through his work, Korean churches not only grew numerically but also began to recover their moral and civic voice in society. He redirected the evangelical movement toward a public theology that held both heaven and the world in view‚Äîa model that remains deeply relevant in the global church today.

<p>
In the 1980s, amidst the geopolitical and ideological divides between South and North Korea, West and East Germany, Lee Young-bin spoke of peace and reunification in the name of faith. His work was not merely nationalist or political solidarity‚Äîit was the practical embodiment of Christian theology of reunification. Throughout his life, Lee redefined the task of Korean reunification as not a national project but as a divine calling, a response of the Church. At the core of his vision was the theology of Karl Barth and his notion of the ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù which Lee rooted in a rare but powerful theological praxis connecting Christianity and socialism.
</p>
<p>
Lee was deeply influenced by Barth‚Äôs vision of the Church as a space of reconciliation. Barth criticized both Western capitalism and Eastern communism for claiming a monopoly on divine justice, insisting that the Church must take neither side, but rather proclaim the reconciliation of Christ from a third, prophetic position. Lee took this insight seriously and attempted to live it out in the very heart of Cold War Germany and divided Korea. For him, faith was the only ground from which the seemingly impossible dialogue between South and North, capitalism and socialism, could begin.
</p>
<p>
He saw reunification as a theological task: ‚ÄúThe gospel does not presuppose division. The Kingdom of God does not draw borders‚Äîit tears them down‚Äù<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. From this conviction, reunification became for Lee not a matter of politics or national emotion, but a process of enacting God‚Äôs justice and reconciliation. For him, reunification required repentance on both sides‚Äîa prophetic confrontation with history. ‚ÄúBoth North and South must confess their sins toward one another,‚Äù he repeatedly emphasized<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This perspective shaped all his activities. With fellow Korean Christians in Germany, he established the <em>Christian Conference for the Reunification of Korea Abroad</em>. Its founding was grounded in the conviction that ‚Äúthe community must not be built on ideological confrontation but on faith.‚Äù He famously declared, ‚ÄúIn Christ, we transcend left and right. Christians in the North and Christians in the South are brothers before God‚Äù<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. This belief defined the first unofficial religious dialogue held in East Berlin. Rather than a diplomatic event, the meeting embodied a theological confession of faith and fraternity across the division.
</p>
<p>
Lee also insisted that the tools for reunification must come from the Church‚Äôs own language‚Äîevangelism, worship, and prayer. ‚ÄúPrayer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútranscends confrontation and makes solidarity possible‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. During the first North‚ÄìSouth religious dialogue, participants prayed together‚Äîa moment that was more than symbolic. It was a genuine act of faith, and a bold redefinition of what reunification could mean when shaped by Christian liturgy.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Lee issued prophetic critique to the Korean Church. ‚ÄúThe Korean Church has mistaken anti-communism for the gospel. But the gospel is a message of peace, not a weapon of hatred,‚Äù he said<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. He further warned, ‚ÄúWhen Christianity becomes a servant of power, the gospel dies. We must return to the cross‚Äù<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. He viewed the Church not as an institution aligned with the state, but as the body of Christ kneeling before the pain of the divided people.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs praxis expanded through transnational ecumenical solidarity. He built bridges with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), and Protestant organizations in Switzerland, creating channels for dialogue between North and South Korean Christians. The reunification dialogues that emerged were not just meetings‚Äîthey were examples of how Christian universal values could be embodied in the specific political context of the Korean Peninsula.
</p>
<p>
As Lee often said, ‚ÄúTrue reunification is only possible when Christianity embraces both the North and the South as God‚Äôs people‚Äù<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. His life shows how the gospel, when lived faithfully, becomes a language of peace that crosses borders. In the 1980s, when the Korean Church was entangled in state ideology, Lee offered a prophetic alternative‚Äîone that united theology and action, memory and reconciliation, the cross and national history.

Dorothea Schweizer (Deutsche Ostasienmission: German East Asia Mission)
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">

</p>

<p>
The 1980s were a time of intense struggle in South Korea, as the nation fought to escape the grip of military dictatorship and move toward democratization. In this critical period, the German missionary Dorothea Schweizer stepped quietly but decisively into the heart of the Korean democratic movement. She was not simply a religious missionary, but a vital bridge for theological and political solidarity, a transmitter of information, and a companion who chose to share in the suffering of the Korean people.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer was dispatched by the Basel Mission and arrived in Korea in 1979. After devoting her first two years to intensive Korean language study, she joined the Korean Theological Institute at the request of theologian Ahn Byung-mu. ‚ÄúShe had a deep interest in the work of the Institute, which sought to explore a theology rooted in the life of suffering Korean people, history, and culture‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. She assisted in editing Ahn‚Äôs letters in German, managing correspondence with German churches, and coordinating communication with foreign theologians. When prominent theologians such as J√ºrgen Moltmann, Rudolf Bohren, and Eberhard Bethge visited Korea, Schweizer played a key role in facilitating their dialogue with Korean thinkers, contributing to the internationalization of Minjung theology.
</p>
<p>
Her mission was never confined to an office. Schweizer personally visited urban poor communities, coal mine strikes, farmers‚Äô protests, and labor movements. Her work went beyond documentation‚Äîshe served as a theological reporter and field observer, providing timely and accurate assessments of Korean socio-political conditions to the German church. ‚ÄúShe was a diligent, participatory observer who actively engaged with urban poor movements, Minjung churches, labor and farmer protests, and reported on these to the German churches‚Äù<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In May 1980, during the Gwangju Uprising and the subsequent wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists, Schweizer became deeply involved in the aftermath of the National Salvation Declaration released at Myeongdong Cathedral. She stood in solidarity with members of the Galilee Church, including Lee Hae-dong, Moon Ik-hwan, and Lee Woo-jung, attending the trials and reporting on them to church networks in Germany. Her reports were not passive summaries but urgent calls for solidarity: ‚ÄúHer circular letters became decisive evidence that mobilized German church support for Korea‚Äôs democratic movement‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. Pastor Kim Kwan-seok described her as ‚Äúsomeone who took each German delegate by the hand and explained Korea‚Äôs situation to them one by one. It was a tremendous contribution‚Äù<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of her most original contributions was her support in founding the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood (KDS). This was the realization of Ahn Byung-mu‚Äôs long-held dream: a Protestant community of single women devoted to spiritual life and social service. Schweizer studied diaconal communities in Germany and France and helped train the founding members in spiritual practices and communal life. The KDS was established on May 1, 1980, and soon began offering prayer, health care, and spiritual retreat services in Mokpo. ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister to the sisters, quietly encouraging them with a smile‚Äù<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Schweizer also played a crucial role in establishing the Mission Education Center, which provided theological education for professors who had been dismissed and students who had been expelled during the Yushin regime. The center became a vital space for ecumenical encounter and democratic theological formation. Schweizer helped draft funding proposals and managed reports to EMS and the Berlin Mission, ensuring the financial sustainability of the center‚Äôs operations.
</p>
<p>
Her work continued after she returned to Germany in 1985. From 1986 to 1998, she worked with international mission and diaconal agencies and gave public talks and sermons about her experience in Korea. Even in 2015, she reflected, ‚ÄúKorea changed me completely. It was a kind of new birth‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Dorothea Schweizer was never a figure in the spotlight. But she was always present‚Äîlistening, documenting, praying, translating, and quietly building communities. Her mission was not one of proclamation but of accompaniment. And it was precisely this deep and faithful accompaniment that left a lasting imprint on both Korean democratization and the theological imagination of the 1980s.

National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) ÌïúÍµ≠Í∏∞ÎèÖÍµêÍµêÌöåÌòëÏùòÌöå
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1980s in South Korea were marked by a triple burden of authoritarian military rule, the unequal effects of rapid industrialization, and the ongoing tension of Cold War division. Citizens‚Äô rights and the livelihoods of the working poor were often sacrificed in the name of national security and economic growth. In this context, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) emerged not just as an ecumenical body of denominations, but as a prophetic actor in the fields of democratization, human rights, and reunification.
</p>
<p>
In 1983, the NCCK made a bold public theological statement, declaring that the division of the Korean peninsula was not merely a geopolitical or political issue but a matter of Christian faith.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDivision is the root of poverty, dictatorship, and the threat of nuclear war. Overcoming division is the very act of living out our faith.‚Äù<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> This declaration was groundbreaking. At the time, public discourse about reunification was often treated as subversive or pro-North Korean. By claiming that the issue was central to Christian mission, NCCK gave churches a theological rationale for public engagement in peace and unification.
</p>
<p>
This theological conviction translated into action. In 1986, representatives from NCCK and the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) of North Korea held an unofficial civil-level dialogue in Glion, Switzerland, marking the first meeting between Protestant representatives from both Koreas outside of governmental control.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe Glion Meeting marked a historic turning point where North and South Korean Christians, beyond ideology and borders, sought a vision of national reconciliation.‚Äù<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a> Between 1986 and 1988, three such meetings were held. These meetings demonstrated that the churches of North and South could form bonds based on shared faith, even in a deeply divided land.
</p>
<p>
One theological bridge between NCCK and its North Korean counterparts lay in the convergence of Minjung theology and Juche ideology. ‚ÄúMinjung theology and Juche thought both placed the oppressed people or ‚Äòmasses‚Äô at the center of history, opening a space for meaningful inter-ideological dialogue.‚Äù<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a> Minjung theology, rooted in Korean struggles, declared that Jesus is present among the suffering people and that faith must be enacted in solidarity with the oppressed. This made inter-Korean dialogue a matter of Christian vocation.
</p>
<p>
Such moves, however, provoked state repression. In 1985, when the NCCK attempted to hold a church-led national reunification conference, the government banned it under the National Security Law. In response, the NCCK released a public statement outlining its ‚ÄúThree Principles for Reunification‚Äù:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
Reunification is not the sole task of the state‚Äîit is the responsibility of all citizens.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Both regimes must not use division as a tool for preserving power.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Christians have both the freedom and responsibility to engage in reunification efforts<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This declaration challenged the government‚Äôs monopoly over national identity, insisting that faith-based civil society had a legitimate voice in political life.
</p>
<p>
What enabled NCCK to sustain such prophetic activities, despite pressure and surveillance, was its deep connection with the global ecumenical movement. Churches in West Germany, the World Council of Churches (WCC), and Christian Aid provided financial and moral support. In 1978, NCCK‚Äôs total annual income reached 158.46 million KRW, of which over 110.57 million KRW (about 70%) came from foreign church grants. Major contributors included BfW (49.9%), WCC (21%), Christian Aid, ICCO, and NCCUSA<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a>. These funds empowered NCCK to maintain its independence and pursue social justice initiatives.
</p>
<p>
The aid wasn‚Äôt limited to declarations. It funded on-the-ground projects for marginalized populations. In 1972, Brot f√ºr die Welt (BfW) signed a formal agreement to support urban mission work in Korea through Project P1732, contributing 203,000 Deutsche Marks<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a>. These funds enabled NCCK to support poor urban communities, displaced workers, and emerging grassroots activists.
</p>
<p>
A particularly important figure in mobilizing global support was Oh Jae-shik, who served in WCC and CCA urban mission bodies. Through his efforts, the WCC URM budget expanded from $5,000 to $2 million. Half of that budget was designated for Asia, and $500,000 was directed to Korean projects, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
industrial mission centers
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
living expenses for dismissed professors
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
aid for families of political prisoners
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
publication of the progressive magazine <em>Mal</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
founding of environmental justice institutes<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
‚ÄúMuch of the $500,000 raised by Oh Jae-shik was used to support Korea‚Äôs urban industrial mission, dismissed professors, and political prisoners‚Äô families.‚Äù‚Å∑ These efforts transformed NCCK into a channel for international pressure against authoritarianism and a conduit for civil society building in Korea.
</p>
<p>
Internally, NCCK‚Äôs activism also reshaped Korean Christian theology. Thinkers like J√ºrgen Moltmann (Theology of Hope), Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Theology of Resistance), and the Barmen Declaration from Germany influenced Korean theologians. These ideas merged with Minjung theology, helping to formulate the belief that ‚Äúhuman rights activism is itself Christian mission.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe courage and faith of the Korean church under severe repression moved many in the German churches. We Christians have much to learn from them.‚Äù ‚Äî Testimony of Dorothea Schweitzer<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, the NCCK of the 1980s stood as more than an ecclesiastical institution. It became a faith-based agent of social transformation, embodying what it meant to resist dictatorship, heal national division, and stand with the suffering. Its work offers a model of how religion, when rooted in solidarity and justice, can challenge the powers of its time and offer hope to a broken nation.

Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the 1980s, the Korean Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) actively pursued the vision of <em>Minjok Bogeumhwa</em> (National Evangelization), expanding its mission from student evangelism to national transformation and global outreach. Under the leadership of Rev.&nbsp;Kim Joon-gon, CCC transitioned from a campus-focused ministry to one that envisioned evangelizing the entire nation and sending missionaries across the globe. This vision was actualized through a multi-layered strategy that encompassed personal evangelism, systematic discipleship training, international missions, and cultural ministries.
</p>
<p>
One of CCC‚Äôs most well-known methods was personal evangelism using gospel tracts, particularly the <em>Four Spiritual Laws</em>. CCC staff and student leaders frequently visited campuses to conduct one-on-one evangelism, explaining salvation through a concise four-point structure: God‚Äôs plan, humanity‚Äôs sin, Jesus‚Äô sacrifice, and salvation through faith. This approach quickly became a model for campus evangelism nationwide and was recognized for its systematic and scalable format<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a>‚Äã.
</p>
<p>
Following evangelism, CCC implemented a rigorous, multi-stage discipleship training system. The training followed a five-step trajectory: personal nurturing ‚Üí basic cell groups (ÏàúÎ™®ÏûÑ) ‚Üí discipleship training ‚Üí leadership training ‚Üí mission sending. Small group Bible studies, quiet time practices, and prayer meetings were conducted under the supervision of campus staff and student leaders (ÏàúÏû•). These structured programs not only deepened spiritual formation but also influenced lay leadership training programs in many Korean churches<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a>‚Äã.
</p>
<p>
During this decade, CCC organized massive nationwide revival and training events such as the National Evangelization Leadership Training Conferences, Explo ‚Äô74, and the 1980 World Evangelization Convention. These events combined mass worship with residential evangelism training, in which ordinary students were trained as evangelists and small group Bible study leaders through an intensive living and learning experience. These students were then dispatched to churches and campuses across the country. Kim Joon-gon proclaimed this as a movement ‚Äúto revolutionize the nation through the gospel, mobilizing two million Christians‚Äù<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a>‚Äã.
</p>
<p>
CCC also expanded into overseas missions during the 1980s. The organization began organizing short-term mission trips to countries such as the Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan, and later started deploying long-term missionaries. In the 1990s, CCC launched ‚ÄúNew Life 2000,‚Äù a major overseas outreach project that involved sending mission teams and church planters abroad. Along with training during retreats, CCC aligned with international evangelical conferences and developed a long-term missionary sending infrastructure<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a>‚Äã.
</p>
<p>
CCC‚Äôs cultural ministry also flourished in the 1980s. The group formed over a dozen gospel music teams‚Äîincluding <em>Good Life</em> and <em>Crossroads</em>‚Äîwhich performed domestically and internationally as part of its <em>praise evangelism</em> strategy. CCC also dubbed the internationally renowned <em>JESUS</em> film into Korean and established an audiovisual department to support film-based evangelism. In 1989, the professional praise team <em>Mobil</em> was formed, elevating CCC‚Äôs presence in Christian media and culture<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a>‚Äã.
</p>
<p>
Through these activities, CCC became more than a campus ministry‚Äîit emerged as the flagship of conservative evangelical student movements in South Korea. However, its emphasis on national revival and its cooperative stance with authoritarian governments drew criticism from progressive Christian student groups like KSCF, who saw CCC‚Äôs message as politically conservative and disconnected from the suffering of marginalized groups. Nevertheless, CCC‚Äôs well-organized strategies, training models, and cultural productions significantly shaped the trajectory of Korean Protestantism. Many of CCC‚Äôs alumni went on to become prominent pastors, missionaries, and leaders in church and society<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a>‚Äã.

</ol>
<p>
The 1980s was a turbulent decade in South Korea, marked by authoritarian rule, state violence, and widespread social unrest. In this context, the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), a progressive ecumenical Christian student movement, played a significant role in linking Christian faith to the people‚Äôs struggle for democracy and justice.
</p>
<p>
One of the most defining events for KSCF in this decade was the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980, when government troops brutally suppressed pro-democracy protesters. For many Christian students, the massacre in Gwangju became a moment of spiritual and political awakening. KSCF interpreted the uprising not only as a political tragedy but as a call for prophetic Christian action. According to internal testimonies, ‚Äútelling the truth about Gwangju was itself an act of faith.‚Äù KSCF organized Bible studies and memorial services to reflect on the event theologically, often under government surveillance. These activities positioned the group as a rare voice of moral resistance within the student and church communities.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
During the early 1980s, the authoritarian regime banned or tightly regulated student unions and organizations. KSCF responded by revitalizing its grassroots student base through alternative networks. A major initiative was the expansion of the Haksadan (Student Social Development Unit). Through this program, KSCF students immersed themselves in marginalized communities. For instance, Yonsei University students engaged with displaced urban poor in the Yeonhui-dong apartment district; Korea University students worked in the polluted industrial zone of Jongam-dong; and Kyung Hee University students investigated social conditions in the slums along Cheonggyecheon stream.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136" role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a> These on-the-ground experiences were not just community service but were framed as acts of discipleship, intended to align Christian practice with Jesus‚Äô solidarity with the oppressed.
</p>
<p>
In addition, KSCF‚Äôs commitment to critical theology led it to adopt and reinterpret minjung theology<strong>,</strong> a Korean contextual theology that identifies the ‚Äúminjung‚Äù (the oppressed masses) as the primary subject of God‚Äôs redemptive work. Bible reading and worship became tools for social awareness. KSCF facilitated nationwide Bible study campaigns, emphasizing stories of the Hebrew exodus and Jesus‚Äô ministry among the poor. These studies inspired many students to consider their faith in terms of justice, liberation, and structural change. One student from this era recalled, ‚ÄúOur Bible study on Exodus gave us the courage to speak out against dictatorship and to act in solidarity with laborers and farmers.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
KSCF also attempted to rebuild student associations that had been disbanded by the military regime. After the government loosened some restrictions in 1983, KSCF members on several campuses helped reestablish full-fledged student councils by 1984. This reorganization enabled Christian students to publicly engage in university reform, human rights advocacy, and anti-war protests alongside secular student groups. Despite pressure from both the state and conservative church circles, KSCF persisted in acting as a bridge between the church and democratization movements.
</p>
<p>
The group, however, faced internal tensions. Some members, influenced by Marxist analysis, questioned whether Christian faith was compatible with revolutionary activism. Others remained committed to the unique value of theological critique. This ideological tension sometimes led to fragmentation. Yet, many within KSCF sought to synthesize faith and action, claiming that ‚Äúrevolution without faith becomes ideology, and faith without justice becomes hypocrisy.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
KSCF‚Äôs work had far-reaching effects. Within the church, it challenged traditional youth ministries and inspired local congregations to rethink their role in society. Outside the church, its public witness helped to counter the dominant image of Christianity as an ally of the military regime. Many KSCF alumni went on to become leaders in NGOs, labor unions, human rights organizations, and peace movements.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the Korea Student Christian Federation in the 1980s modeled a theology that was both reflective and revolutionary. Grounded in scripture, committed to justice, and incarnated in the lives of the oppressed, KSCF embodied a form of discipleship that refused to separate faith from history. Through protests, prayer vigils, Bible studies, and grassroots organizing, it shaped a generation of Christian activists who carried their vision well beyond campus walls.

<p>
YMCA
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1980s was a period of dramatic transformation for the Korean YMCA, especially in cities like Seoul and Gwangju, where the organization emerged as a visible and trusted actor in South Korea‚Äôs democratization and civil society movements. Though originally formed as a Christian youth service organization, the YMCA began to redefine itself as a movement grounded in people-centered theology, democratic engagement, and local empowerment.
</p>
<p>
One of the most powerful examples of this shift occurred during the May 18 Gwangju Uprising in 1980, when citizens in the southwestern city of Gwangju rose up against the newly installed military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan. The uprising was met with extreme military violence, leaving hundreds dead. In the midst of this crisis, the Gwangju YMCA opened its auditorium and meeting rooms to citizen leaders, grieving families, and prayer gatherings. When martial law banned all public meetings, ‚Äúthe YMCA auditorium on Geumnam-ro remained the only place where prayers for justice could be spoken aloud.‚Äù<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a> YMCA leaders also participated in citizen mediation efforts and preserved testimonies of the massacre, even as the central YMCA leadership avoided direct political confrontation.
</p>
<p>
In Seoul, the Yonsei University YMCA (SCA) was expanding its vision of Christian discipleship through immersion-based ministry. In 1982, 39 students were sent into Korea‚Äôs most marginalized areas, including the Nanjido landfill (a massive garbage mountain), leprosy colonies, and the Pulmuwon farming cooperative. These student volunteers did not visit briefly‚Äîthey lived alongside the residents, sharing meals and daily labor. One participant recalled, ‚ÄúLiving in the community became a form of spiritual formation, where we interpreted the suffering of the poor through the lens of faith.‚Äù<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This theology of incarnation and resistance led to further experimentation. In 1983 and 1984, students from the Yonsei SCA launched a rural cooperative experiment in the Namyangman region, promoting collective farming, economic self-reliance, and Christian community. ‚ÄúThe Namyangman project was not about charity,‚Äù a leader explained, ‚Äúbut about modeling an alternative society grounded in cooperation, reflection, and faith.‚Äù<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This work was sustained by intellectual formation. Yonsei YMCA initiated the Nuruk Bible School and hosted a series of lectures by leading Christian thinkers such as Ham Seok-heon, Jang Il-jo, and Kim Jae-joon, addressing topics like Marxism, revolution, and technocracy. These conversations reflected a yearning among students to build a ‚ÄúChristian language that could make sense of injustice, exploitation, and dictatorship.‚Äù<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
While these activities were rooted in faith, they also reshaped public life. Many Yonsei SCA alumni went on to lead YMCA branches across the country‚Äîin Seoul, Incheon, Busan, Daejeon, and Daegu‚Äîspreading a model of socially engaged Christianity grounded in civil society leadership. ‚ÄúMany SCA graduates became YMCA leaders across the country and shaped Korea‚Äôs faith-based civic culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Theologically and institutionally, the 1980s was also the decade in which the Korean YMCA formally embraced its activist identity. In 1976, it had already revised its mission statement, inspired by the World YMCA‚Äôs Kampala Declaration, which called for democratization, economic justice, and people-centered development. By the early 1980s, YMCA leaders like Kang Moon-kyu spoke openly about the need to serve not just the young, but the ‚Äúsuffering people (minjung),‚Äù redefining YMCA as a ‚Äúfunctional church‚Äù‚Äîa church in movement and solidarity.‚Äù<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142" role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
By the end of the decade, YMCA had become one of Korea‚Äôs most respected civil organizations, engaging in campaigns for labor rights, environmental sustainability, and community-based economic justice. Its prayer meetings became protests, and its service programs became political testimonies‚Äîmaking the 1980s a defining chapter in the re-Christianization of Korea‚Äôs civic space.
</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>
<p>
YWCA
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the 1980s, the Korean YWCA emerged as one of the few Christian organizations where women could engage in faith-based activism at the intersection of gender justice, democracy, and daily survival. While its national office maintained a cautious stance under authoritarian rule, many local YWCA chapters developed a bold and practical theology grounded in the lived experiences of working-class women.
</p>
<p>
The most dramatic episode unfolded in Gwangju during the May 18 Uprising of 1980, when citizens resisted the military coup led by Chun Doo-hwan. As troops opened fire on unarmed civilians, local churches and organizations were paralyzed by fear or shut down entirely. But the Gwangju YWCA remained open, providing space for prayer, rest, and strategic discussion among community members. According to one researcher, ‚ÄúYWCA leaders participated in the citizens‚Äô mediation committee and supported post-trauma healing for women and youth in the wake of the massacre.‚Äù<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a> Though the national YWCA could not issue public statements, these local actions spoke powerfully to the organization‚Äôs rootedness in community care and justice.
</p>
<p>
In Seoul and other urban centers, the YWCA addressed a different kind of crisis: the everyday injustice faced by women workers. The 1980s marked a period of explosive industrialization in South Korea, during which many women found work in factories under exploitative conditions. In response, YWCA programs focused on vocational training, legal rights education, and occupational safety for working-class women. One staff member recalled, ‚ÄúWe were not theologians; we were Christian women in the field, struggling to bring prayer and protest together.‚Äù<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1985, the Seoul YWCA launched its Women‚Äôs Labor Counseling Center, where factory workers‚Äîmany in their teens and early twenties‚Äîcould seek help for wage theft, sexual harassment, and industrial injuries. These services were often delivered by volunteers trained in both legal literacy and Christian counseling. Through this work, the YWCA built a new model of Christian service: not charitable aid, but solidarity rooted in shared faith and feminist consciousness.
</p>
<p>
As part of its theological formation, YWCA organized a range of public education programs such as the ‚ÄúWednesday Lecture Series‚Äù and ‚ÄúMinjung Women‚Äôs Roundtables.‚Äù These events explored the role of women in democratization, theology, and social transformation. For example, one roundtable in Gwangju brought together theologians, farmers, labor activists, and survivors of political violence to ask: How can Christian women respond to injustice not only with compassion but with collective power?<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Although not directly aligned with liberation theology or the minjung theology movement, the YWCA articulated what some scholars have called a ‚Äúpraxis-based Christian feminism.‚Äù This approach emphasized incarnation, service, and justice over ideological dogma. It grounded its theology not in abstract doctrine but in the realities of domestic violence, unequal labor, and silenced voices. As one participant put it, ‚ÄúWe found Christ in the sewing machines, in the strike shelters, and in the tears of single mothers.‚Äù<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The impact of the 1980s YWCA extended both within and beyond the church. Inside the church, it created space for laywomen‚Äôs leadership and challenged male-dominated authority structures. Outside the church, it trained a generation of Christian women activists who would go on to found NGOs, join peace movements, and influence public policy. In doing so, YWCA redefined what it meant to be a faithful Christian woman in an age of rapid change and deep injustice.

NCC Thursday Prayer Meetings
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This Meeting began in the midst of the authoritarian Yushin regime in the 1970s and grew throughout the 1980s into a space of solidarity and resistance‚Äîa living embodiment of Korean Christianity‚Äôs faith-in-action during times of suffering.
</p>
<p>
The prayer meetings began on July 18, 1974, as a response to widespread arrests under the Yushin regime‚Äôs emergency decrees. Countless student activists and democracy advocates were imprisoned, and many Christian pastors felt compelled to respond. Leaders from the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)‚Äîincluding Kim Sang-geun, Lee Hae-dong, and Moon Dong-hwan‚Äîgathered regularly with families of detainees at the Christian Building in Jongno, Seoul, for what they called the ‚ÄúRegular Thursday Prayer Meeting with the Incarcerated.‚Äù Over time, it expanded into the ‚ÄúRegular Thursday Prayer Meeting for the Realization of Justice and Freedom.‚Äù On April 10, 1975, the day after the rushed executions of eight individuals connected to the Inhyeokdang case, prayer meeting attendees rushed to the mortuary and were forcibly detained by police while trying to prevent the seizure of the victims‚Äô bodies. This incident made clear that the Thursday gatherings were not just religious rituals‚Äîthey were public acts of protest against state violence<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
As the years passed, the themes and scope of the meetings grew. From 1977, the voices of workers suffering from exploitation and dismissal began to take center stage. Meetings featured handwritten petitions and appeals from women laborers at factories such as Banglim Spinning and Samgosa. These events marked the expansion of the prayer meeting from a focus on students and political dissidents to a broader platform that included workers and farmers as well.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a>At the July 22, 1977 prayer meeting, a young worker named Kim Il-sim, who had been harassed and relocated for attending the Christian Industrial Mission, read a heartfelt statement: ‚ÄúIs it really such a crime to attend the Industrial Mission? I‚Äôve done nothing wrong except ask for my rightful overtime pay and join a church group that prays for workers like me.‚Äù<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> These testimonies reveal how the prayer meetings became not only a space for elite or student dissidents, but also a platform for the working poor to speak their truth.
</p>
<p>
These developments brought greater surveillance and violence. On September 22, 1979, during a special prayer meeting for dismissed workers from Dongil Spinning attended by over 500 people, plainclothes officers stormed the building and brutally beat participants. The incident became known as the ‚Äú9/22 Christian Building Incident.‚Äù Police attacked pastors, women, students, and workers alike. One woman was dragged down the stairs by her hair. Another female student was kicked in the chest. Pastor Cho Hwa-soon was beaten unconscious and carried away in a police van. Despite dozens being detained, the Friday prayer meetings did not stop; rather, they gained renewed urgency and attention<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The early 1980s marked a period of darkness. Following the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, the newly entrenched military regime further clamped down. The prayer meetings could no longer be held openly and were replaced by visits to detainees‚Äô families and small, private worship services. But on February 11, 1982, they resumed under the new name: ‚ÄúThursday Worship with Those Who Suffer.‚Äù These services took place twice a month and continued to highlight state abuses. For example, in April 1983, after reports emerged of students being beaten en masse at Seodaemun Detention Center, the prayer meeting became a site for public denunciations, with families reading petitions and protest letters. NCC leaders even visited the Ministry of Justice, calling for an independent investigation. This showed that the prayer meetings were not merely spiritual gatherings but an active platform for human rights advocacy and action.
</p>
<p>
In May 1984, the prayer meetings regained their weekly format and began a new phase of growth. Attendance surged, and speakers from a wide range of denominations, regions, and professions joined the pulpit. Among them, Pastor Park Hyung-kyu delivered more than ten sermons during the 1980s and was arrested after offering a benediction on October 30, 1986. These years saw the meetings serve as a sanctuary and stage for victims of the Gwangju Uprising, families of political prisoners, workers suffering from unpaid wages, and others in the margins. The meetings cultivated solidarity and a spirit of shared resistance among churches, advocacy organizations, and civil society.
</p>
<p>
The meetings also had a global reach. Korean diasporic communities in Los Angeles, New York, Germany, and Canada held Thursday Prayer Meetings in solidarity, publishing updates in human rights newsletters and staging their own protests. In 1985, a solidarity prayer meeting was held in New York for the Dongil Spinning workers, involving both Korean-Americans and members of the global ecumenical movement. This demonstrated that the meetings were not confined to Korea‚Äîthey had become a node in the worldwide Christian struggle for justice and human dignity.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the NCC Thursday Prayer Meetings were far more than a church ritual. They were sacred spaces of lament, hope, and protest, where Christian faith confronted authoritarianism head-on. Through them, the tears of the suffering were transformed into shared cries for justice. Those who read prayers, wept for the detained, or were arrested for offering sermons stood together‚Äînot as political actors alone, but as the body of Christ seeking God‚Äôs justice and mercy in a broken society.

Korean Diakonia Sisterhood
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One of the most distinctive identities of the Korean Diakonia Sisterhood lies in its embodiment of a ‚ÄúProtestant monastic community.‚Äù Traditionally, the concept of a monastery in Korean society has been associated exclusively with Catholicism. However, the Diakonia Sisterhood challenged this assumption and opened up an entirely new possibility for a monastic life rooted in Protestant theology. They neither wore habits nor took lifelong vows, but they established communal rules and lived a daily rhythm of prayer, work, and learning‚Äîembodying a monastic way of life in every sense.
</p>
<p>
Their life was ‚Äúnot a cloistered withdrawal but a monastic practice of prayer and service within the reality of everyday life.‚Äù One sister recalled, ‚ÄúWe had no habits, and we didn‚Äôt take lifelong vows like in traditional orders, but our life was monastic in every way. We prayed, worked, ate together, and started and ended each day with Scripture and sharing.‚Äù<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This Protestant monastic spirituality aimed at ‚Äúliving a contemplative life within daily activities.‚Äù As one scholar described, ‚ÄúTheir spirituality was a Martha-like mode of life, where contemplative silence and active service were seamlessly integrated.‚Äù<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> In this way, the sisters lived out God‚Äôs will through both silence and action: tending to the sick, working in the fields, and revitalizing the village community. Their daily rhythm made no distinction between prayer and work. ‚ÄúThe Sisterhood prayed while working and worked while praying. It was a new form of monastery that experienced God‚Äôs presence not behind walls, but in the midst of the world.‚Äù<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The community‚Äôs spiritual foundation drew from Lutheran monastic traditions, Bonhoeffer‚Äôs <em>Life Together</em>, and the practical demands of Minjung theology. Deeply influenced by Bonhoeffer, they demonstrated ‚Äúthat Protestants, too, could live a monastic life in real practice.‚Äù<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a> Ahn Byung-mu notably encouraged women ‚Äúto break free from the confines of marriage and domestic labor, to embrace celibacy as a theological choice, and to live a monastic life in solidarity with the oppressed.‚Äù<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a>In this sense, the Diakonia Sisterhood‚Äôs significance lies in how it ‚Äúredefined the model of a traditional monastery and proposed a new vision of monastic life possible even within Protestantism.‚Äù<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a>

Democratic Society Construction Council (Minjon)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Democratic Society Construction Council (Minjon), active in Germany, was officially established on March 1, 1974, following an anti-Yushin dictatorship rally held at Beethoven Square in Bonn. This gathering went beyond a mere statement against the Yushin regime‚Äîit was a declaration of intent to launch a full-fledged democratization movement. At the event, participants read aloud the ‚ÄúDeclaration for the Construction of a Democratic Society,‚Äù signaling organized resistance to the regime. The statement proclaimed, ‚ÄúIn solidarity with the Korean people‚Äôs struggle to reclaim freedom and human dignity under the oppression and fear of the Yushin system, we will continue our efforts here in Germany to build a democratic society‚Äù<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The council brought together Koreans from diverse social backgrounds in Germany‚Äîstudents, miners, nurses, and religious workers‚Äîforming a rare coalition. According to early membership records, about 45.5% were students, with the remainder made up of miners and nurses<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a>. Their solidarity was more than cross-class cooperation‚Äîit was a transnational experiment in diaspora democracy, requiring the coordination of different political strategies, languages, and sensibilities.
</p>
<p>
From its inception, Minjon sought to move beyond the confines of an intellectual student circle. A defining case of concrete action was the 1975 Balzheim mine incident. After receiving reports of human rights violations involving Korean miners, Minjon organized its own fact-finding delegation. The team collaborated closely with the German press and civil society, bringing the issue to public attention. For the first time, German society raised formal questions about the Korean government‚Äôs overseas labor policy and its compatibility with international human rights standards<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Another major activity was international solidarity efforts for the release of political prisoners. Minjon supported the release of Kim Ji-ha and Kim Dae-jung through joint statements and campaigns with Amnesty International and German churches. With the help of Professor G√ºnter Freudenberg, Minjon founded the Korea Committee (Korea Komitee), which later evolved into the Korea Verband. Freudenberg stated, ‚ÄúWhat is happening in Korea is not just their problem. An affront to democracy anywhere must be resisted everywhere‚Äù<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a>. Through this international network, Minjon succeeded in reframing Korean issues within the global human rights agenda.
</p>
<p>
One of the most emblematic examples of this international solidarity was the campaign to save Kim Dae-jung, who had been sentenced to death in 1980 by the Korean military regime. Minjon viewed this not as an individual case, but as a critical moment for Korean democracy itself, and launched a wide-scale campaign aimed at galvanizing global public opinion.
</p>
<p>
A particularly noteworthy episode involved direct political intervention by the German Protestant Church. In November 1980, Minjon sent a petition to the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) and other major denominations. Soon, leaders from the Lutheran and other Protestant churches issued formal requests to the South Korean government to halt Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs execution. One such statement read, ‚ÄúChristians do not remain silent in the face of state violence that threatens life.‚Äù This declaration was drafted by Minjon activist Lee Sam-yeol in English and later translated and distributed in German and Korean<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
These international appeals soon translated into diplomatic action. Some members of the German Bundestag raised parliamentary questions regarding the suppression of political freedom in Korea, and the German Foreign Office conveyed human rights concerns through unofficial channels to the South Korean embassy. To support these efforts, Minjon compiled English-language summaries and Korean newspaper clippings on Kim Dae-jung‚Äôs case and mailed them directly to German lawmakers and media outlets<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162" role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a>. This rescue campaign became a sophisticated transnational civic movement that combined advocacy, translation, lobbying, and coalition-building.
</p>
<p>
Another urgent priority for Minjon was uncovering the truth behind the Gwangju Uprising of May 1980. After the South Korean media and government portrayed the movement as a violent insurrection, Minjon worked from late 1980 onward to inform the international community of the massacre‚Äôs actual scale. They formed a ‚ÄúGwangju Truth-Finding International Support Committee‚Äù with Korean students, miners, and nurses in Germany, and held ‚ÄúGwangju Uprising Testimony Forums‚Äù in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich. These forums featured photographs smuggled out of Korea and testimonies from bereaved families, exposing the indiscriminate killings and press censorship under the military junta<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163" role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1981, in collaboration with progressive German journalists, Minjon held a photo exhibition titled ‚ÄúThe Truth of Gwangju‚Äù (Die Wahrheit von Kwangju) at the Frankfurt City Hall gallery. At the opening ceremony, SPD lawmaker Hans-Georg Werner declared, ‚ÄúWhat happened in Gwangju is no different from what happened under Hitler‚Äôs rule,‚Äù sparking international shock. Major German newspapers subsequently covered the Gwangju Massacre in detail<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a>. In response, the South Korean government attempted to control damage by pressuring Korean consulates and student associations in Germany to censor such narratives.
</p>
<p>
Far beyond a passive conduit for information, Minjon became a platform for preserving the memory of Gwangju and enabling truth-seeking in Korea through transnational solidarity. From 1982 onward, Minjon held annual memorials for the Gwangju Uprising in major German cities, attended by German citizens, professors, labor unions, and Christian leaders. Activists such as Song Du-yul, Lee Sam-yeol, and Jeong Gyu-myeong emphasized that ‚ÄúThe truth of Gwangju is not just a Korean issue‚Äîit is a matter of global conscience,‚Äù framing remembrance as a moral imperative for humanity<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
These two campaigns‚Äîrescuing Kim Dae-jung and uncovering the truth about Gwangju‚Äîare not only milestones in the struggle for Korean democracy. They also demonstrate how Minjon, operating from Germany, built a transnational field of resistance in cooperation with churches, civil society, and the media. These efforts elevated Korean issues onto the global stage and allowed diaspora Koreans to emerge not merely as students or refugees, but as historical actors in their own right.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, Minjon‚Äôs activities were repeatedly threatened by external surveillance and internal discord. The Korean Central Intelligence Agency, working with the South Korean Embassy in Germany, labeled Minjon members as communists, denied them re-entry visas, and harassed their families. Some members ultimately abandoned plans to return home and lived in de facto political exile. After the Gwangju massacre, many in the organization experienced disillusionment, realizing that the fall of the Yushin regime would not automatically usher in democracy. This led to diminished morale and decreased participation.
</p>
<p>
Minjon also developed in close collaboration with Christian figures and institutions. Leaders such as Lee Sam-yeol, Park Sang-jeung, and Lee Sang-chul connected the movement to the World Council of Churches (WCC) and Protestant networks in Germany, raising the movement‚Äôs legitimacy and visibility. A key moment was the 1975 Geneva conference, where the Christian Democratic Fellowship (CDDF) was launched, providing a theological basis for Minjon‚Äôs political activism. These Christian activists proclaimed that the Gospel should be lived ‚Äúin solidarity with the oppressed‚Äù and that resistance to dictatorship was an act of faith<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166" role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, Minjon faced criticism from within the church. As more Marxist-inclined students and activists took leadership, some in the Christian community felt the group was losing its religious neutrality and becoming overly political. This tension came to a head in 1977, when Minjon debated whether to join the National Alliance for Democratic Reunification (Hanminryeon). The ideological division between Christian and secular factions prompted some members to withdraw from the group<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, Minjon left a lasting impact on Korea‚Äôs democratization movement. The release of Kim Dae-jung, global awareness of the Gwangju Massacre, and international critiques of Korea‚Äôs human rights record all owed much to Minjon‚Äôs informational and advocacy efforts. The organization‚Äôs legacy lived on through its successor, the Association of Korean National-Democratic Movements in Europe (Yureop Minhyeop), which continued the democratization and reunification movement into the late 1980s. More than a single organization, Minjon became a model for how diasporic Koreans could organize across borders, sustain political memory, and influence history from afar.

Christian Democratic Fellowship
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the 1980s, the Christian Democratic Fellowship of Koreans (CDFK), based in Germany, stood out as a unique example of faith-based democratic resistance within the Korean diaspora. Responding to the political repression and human rights violations of the era, CDFK emerged not as a formally established organization at a fixed moment, but rather as a fellowship organically formed by Korean Christians in Germany‚Äîmany of whom, like Yi Sam-y≈èl, Ch≈èng Chi-y≈èng, and Yi Chin-san, had earlier participated in the Democratic Society Construction Council (ÎØºÍ±¥). Their shared conviction was clear: <em>‚Äúfaith and democracy are inseparable.‚Äù</em>
</p>
<p>
One of the most urgent issues to which CDFK responded was the 1980 Gwangju Uprising and, more critically, the Korean church‚Äôs silence regarding the massacre. CDFK interpreted the events in Gwangju not as a regional or political disturbance but as a theological event demanding a faith-based response. In a statement issued on June 5, 1980 in Bonn, they declared:
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúGod stands with the oppressed, and the innocent victims in Gwangju bear the image of Christ on the cross. Their blood cries out to heaven, and the church on earth must no longer remain a co-conspirator in silence. We respond to the cries of the Gwangju people in the name of faith, and call the Korean church to repentance and awakening.‚Äù<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This statement was partially published in a German Protestant periodical and led to joint prayer services with groups such as the Berliner √∂kumenischer Friedenskreis. On June 10, CDFK organized solidarity demonstrations in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Hamburg, drawing around 300 participants, including German citizens, Korean workers, and students. At one such rally, Yi Sam-y≈èl gave a speech proclaiming:
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúThe Korean church is turning away from the cross. Gwangju is not only the pain of the southern provinces; it is a judgment upon all believers. CDFK gathers here today to ask what it means to be the church on the side of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169" role="doc-noteref"><sup>169</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From 1981 onward, CDFK held annual memorial prayer services for Gwangju, collaborating with German Protestant congregations. These services included communal worship, moments of silence, and open reflection. In 1982, the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) regional newsletter even reported on these gatherings. CDFK also maintained active correspondence and solidarity with South Korean Christian resistance groups, particularly the NCCK Human Rights Committee and the Christian Social Action Council in Seoul. In 1985, when the NCCK published its Social Participation Declaration, CDFK issued a public statement of support and translated the document into German, distributing it to WCC-affiliated bodies and church groups throughout Europe.
</p>
<p>
Beyond institutional ties, CDFK also maintained informal connections with student and youth resistance organizations such as KSCF and Minch≈èngry≈èn, exchanging news and publications. In 1986, a CDFK member gave a presentation titled <em>‚ÄúThe Church‚Äôs Responsibility in Korea‚Äôs Democratization‚Äù</em> at the WCC Youth Forum, further solidifying their role as a bridge between Korean and international Christian movements.
</p>
<p>
During the June 1987 Democracy Movement, CDFK again took public action, organizing rallies and issuing a powerful statement titled <em>‚ÄúA Confession and Plea from Christians‚Äù</em>. It read:
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúWe are watching Korea‚Äôs June from Germany. God is on the side of truth and liberation, not falsehood and oppression. We ask Korean Christians: whom does your faith serve?‚Äù<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>170</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This message was sent directly to the NCCK and excerpts were printed in Seoul-based Christian newsletters.
</p>
<p>
In 1988, CDFK added its voice to an international joint statement calling for inter-Korean church dialogue. Taking the initiative, CDFK sent letters proposing a North-South Korean Christian joint prayer service to both the Presbyterian Church (Hapdong) and the Korean Methodist Church. The reaction was swift: Hapdong denounced the proposal as ‚Äúa theological compromise with socialism,‚Äù and several conservative Korean pastors in Germany followed suit, denouncing CDFK in Korean-language diaspora newspapers as a ‚Äúpolitical agitation group‚Äù corrupting the Gospel.
</p>
<p>
In response, CDFK published a theological counter-statement, asserting:
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúOur call for national reconciliation is not an ideological compromise but a restoration of peace and life based on God‚Äôs creative order. The church must stop cloaking division and enmity in the language of faith.‚Äù<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171" role="doc-noteref"><sup>171</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This exchange highlighted a growing theological divide between progressive and conservative churches‚Äîparticularly around the notion of a mission-driven vision of unification. Despite strong opposition, CDFK remained committed to what they called a ‚Äútheology of reconciliation‚Äù and a ‚Äúfaith that crosses the lines of division.‚Äù Their example inspired later generations of diaspora Christians to consider public justice, democracy, and unification as core expressions of their religious calling.

To accompany the in-depth analysis provided in the movement section, this comparative table of the Democratic Society Construction Council (Minjeon) and the Christian Democratic Fellowship of Korea (CDFK) serves a distinct purpose. While the movement narrative explores their theological motivations and historical impact, this table presents their organizational features at a glance, allowing readers to quickly grasp their origins, structure, key figures, ideological orientation, and geographical scope.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, this side-by-side format highlights how both groups‚Äîthough differing in form‚Äîshared a foundational link to Christianity. Minjeon included many Christian individuals motivated by a progressive faith-based conscience, even if the organization itself was not explicitly religious. In contrast, CDFK was formed explicitly on Christian theological grounds, with prayer, worship, and ecumenical dialogue at the core of its activities.
</p>
<p>
By placing these organizations in comparison, the table illustrates how Christian ethics and theology shaped not only their values but also their modes of resistance. This context sets the stage for understanding the theological-political praxis that unfolds more fully in the subsequent movement section.
</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>
<p>
Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ) in the 1980s transformed religion into a means of achieving public justice. It became one of the most powerful and consistent expressions of faith-based action in South Korea‚Äôs democratization movement. CPAJ connected faith with justice, prayer with protest, and the church with civil society, standing against state violence and authoritarian rule. Most significantly, their practice extended beyond church walls and mobilized the public with dynamic energy.
</p>
<p>
Prayer was not silence, and street marches were not retreat. From 1986 to 1987, priests led protest marches following prayer vigils at least 17 times, restoring the tradition of public resistance by religious figures that had been nearly extinguished since the Yushin regime<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172" role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a>. During the constitutional reform crisis of 1987, almost every Catholic diocese in the country participated in hunger strikes<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173" role="doc-noteref"><sup>173</sup></a>‚Äîtransforming individual suffering into an unprecedented nationwide religious action.
</p>
<p>
Myeongdong Cathedral was more than a place of worship. It became the only ‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù in a city paralyzed by the Park Chung-hee regime, and CPAJ turned it into a refuge for democracy. At certain moments, 300 to 400 priests gathered to celebrate Mass for justice<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174" role="doc-noteref"><sup>174</sup></a>, constituting an unparalleled collective act of priestly resistance in Korean religious history. As vigils, fasts, declarations, and marches were repeated, CPAJ established itself as an independent body within the church. In 1989 alone, CPAJ organized nine ‚ÄúPrayer Vigils for Democracy and National Reunification‚Äù across the country, each accompanied by hunger strikes and public statements<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175" role="doc-noteref"><sup>175</sup></a>. This consistent, nationwide mobilization was no longer just religious observance‚Äîit was the formation of a spiritual movement. These actions also elevated the Catholic Church‚Äôs social status. Over a ten-year period, the number of Catholic believers in South Korea doubled<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176" role="doc-noteref"><sup>176</sup></a>, suggesting that CPAJ‚Äôs influence extended beyond political resistance to strengthening the identity and growth of the faith community. CPAJ‚Äôs impact was not strategic church expansion‚Äîit was a natural consequence of speaking truth through faith.
</p>
<p>
CPAJ extended its resistance beyond domestic boundaries by forming international Christian networks, notably with the World Council of Churches (WCC). Their partnership signaled that CPAJ‚Äôs efforts were not just a local resistance but part of a global struggle for justice. In 1975, the WCC convened an emergency meeting in Geneva on the Korean crisis. At this meeting, the Korean Christian Fellowship for Democracy was established, with Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun elected as chair<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177" role="doc-noteref"><sup>177</sup></a>. This organization became a vital bridge between CPAJ, progressive Protestant forces, and the international ecumenical movement, allowing CPAJ to consistently share its work on the global stage.
</p>
<p>
In 1984, the WCC held a conference in Dozan-so, Japan, focused on the theme of Korean reunification, framing Korean democratization as a matter of theological and moral concern<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178" role="doc-noteref"><sup>178</sup></a>. CPAJ‚Äôs actions were interpreted there not merely as political protest but as acts of faithful solidarity with the oppressed, and the WCC incorporated them into its expanded theology of structural human rights. At the time, WCC‚Äôs theological core had shifted from a focus on individual religious freedom to one of liberationist response to structural violence and oppression<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179" role="doc-noteref"><sup>179</sup></a>. When CPAJ denounced the National Security Law, labor oppression, and division through prayer and Mass, the WCC recognized these as part of ‚Äúthe liberating testimony of global Christianity‚Äù and disseminated them across denominational lines.
</p>
<p>
In 1987, amid the June Democratic Uprising, the WCC responded to requests from CPAJ and the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) by helping submit human rights violation reports to the United Nations Human Rights Commission<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180" role="doc-noteref"><sup>180</sup></a> European and North American Catholic communities translated and distributed CPAJ‚Äôs statements, praising Korea as a place where ‚Äúa praying church became a resisting church.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
After the controversial visit to Pyongyang by Father Moon Kyu-hyun in 1989, CPAJ was formally distanced by the Catholic hierarchy. The bishops issued a public statement saying, ‚ÄúThe Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice is not an officially recognized organization,‚Äù thereby cutting official ties<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181" role="doc-noteref"><sup>181</sup></a>. Following this, CPAJ operated more independently, forging alliances not within institutional religion, but with civil society, ecumenical circles, and international networks.
</p>
<p>
The work of CPAJ in the 1980s was a testament to the history of conscience-driven faith clashing with state power. To ‚Äúpray‚Äù meant to resist dictatorship, and to ‚Äúfast‚Äù meant to share in the suffering of the oppressed. Their actions proved that faith, when practiced ethically, could illuminate the path to justice in dark times.
</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>
<p>
Urban Industrial Mission (UIM)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the 1980s, the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) in South Korea evolved beyond simple worker evangelism into a faith-based movement that directly confronted the country‚Äôs structural contradictions. Centered around the interdenominational organization known as the Korean Christian Social Mission Council (SASEON), UIM developed a comprehensive and organized structure that engaged deeply with labor, peasant, urban poor, environmental, and democratization movements. The cases of the Yeongdeungpo UIM, SASEON, and the Busan branch of the Korea Pollution Research Institute (KPRI) are especially illustrative of how Christian activism during this period became intertwined with Korea‚Äôs wider social and political transformation.
</p>
<p>
UIM‚Äôs activities were first and foremost grounded in the labor field. The Yeongdeungpo UIM worked directly with female factory workers in the Guro Industrial Complex, embodying the conviction that ‚Äúa labor union is a church for workers.‚Äù Rather than emphasizing institutional churches, UIM built community through daily life and solidarity on the factory floor. It organized savings cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and housing collectives, integrating spiritual commitment with survival. One participant recalled, ‚ÄúWhen I took charge of the credit union, I witnessed the kingdom of God realized on the labor front through the devotional life of the pastors and missionaries.‚Äù<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182" role="doc-noteref"><sup>182</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This movement became more organized with the establishment of SASEON in 1976. As an ecumenical collaboration between Protestants and Catholics, SASEON initiated cooperative social missions alongside laborers, farmers, the urban poor, and students‚Äîan unprecedented form of interdenominational Christian practice in Korean church history. SASEON declared that ‚Äúthe realization of the Kingdom of God begins not within church walls, but in places of suffering,‚Äù and it transcended theological and denominational boundaries. Services utilized a jointly translated Bible, alternated between the Protestant ‚ÄúHananim‚Äù and the Catholic ‚ÄúHaneunim‚Äù for ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù and replaced Eucharist with symbolic shared meals. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt doctrinal unity, but the shared tears and laughter that built our church,‚Äù one member reflected.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183" role="doc-noteref"><sup>183</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
By the mid-1980s, this movement expanded into environmental issues. The Korea Pollution Research Institute (KPRI), especially its Busan branch, emerged as a key actor. From its founding in 1984, the Busan branch declared that ‚Äúpollution is not merely an environmental issue but a social evil rooted in the structural contradictions of our society and our nation,‚Äù and emphasized solidarity with broader human rights and labor movements.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184" role="doc-noteref"><sup>184</sup></a> Though nominally subordinate to the Seoul headquarters, the Busan branch operated with substantial autonomy.
</p>
<p>
The turning point came with the Onsan disease crisis, which propelled the Busan branch into full-scale anti-pollution activism. In 1985, the branch began publishing the monthly newsletter <em>Pollution and Society</em>, and conducted public education and advocacy efforts across affected areas, including around the Kori nuclear plant and polluted industrial zones like Jangnim and Sasang. It declared that pollution must be approached not just as a public health issue, but as a matter of ‚Äúlife, justice, and peace,‚Äù and that ‚Äúpollution eradication is a movement for life and a movement for peace.‚Äù<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185" role="doc-noteref"><sup>185</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The Busan branch also played a major role in founding the Busan Democratic Citizens‚Äô Council (Buminhyup) in 1985. While formally distinct, the two organizations were functionally intertwined. As activist Kang Mi-kyung recalled, ‚ÄúThere was no real distinction between Gongmunyeon and Buminhyup‚Äîit just became Buminhyup. Even I just drifted from one to the other.‚Äù<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186" role="doc-noteref"><sup>186</sup></a> Buminhyup focused on democratization while the KPRI focused on environmental issues, yet both shared personnel, goals, and organizational infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
In 1989, the Busan branch transitioned into the Citizens‚Äô Coalition for Pollution Eradication (Gongchu-hyup), in line with shifting societal concerns. This new organization addressed pressing issues like nuclear power risks, water pollution, and industrial waste, while promoting ‚Äúpollution eradication and anti-nuclear activism as the foundation for democracy and national peace.‚Äù<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187" role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a> Gongchu-hyup would later become the Busan Federation for Environmental Movements (KFEM Busan) in 1993, continuing the legacy of Christian-driven civic and environmental action.
</p>
<p>
The work of UIM, SASEON, and the Busan KPRI was not merely a Christian social outreach, but a core component of Korea‚Äôs democratization movement. These were not isolated acts of charity, but conscious efforts to find the Kingdom of God in the lives of the oppressed, to reimagine theology through solidarity, and to transform faith into public justice. And while the names have changed, the spirit of these movements‚Äîrooted in democracy, life, and justice‚Äîcontinues in new forms today.

<strong>Christian Student Movements: Evangelization and Democratization</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1980s in South Korea were marked by a triple crisis: military dictatorship, rapid industrialization, and Cold War-era division. Amid these structural upheavals, Korean Christian student movements divided into two distinct streams. One focused on national evangelization and personal salvation, while the other stood with the oppressed and sought structural justice. Though both streams were rooted in Christian faith, their understanding and practice of the Gospel diverged sharply.
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
<strong>Evangelical Stream: CCC and National Evangelization</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, one of the most influential Christian student organizations in South Korea was the Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC). Founded in the early 1960s by Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jun-gon, CCC entered the new decade with an ambitious spiritual and national vision that went far beyond personal faith. This vision was encapsulated in the slogan: ‚ÄúEvangelization of the Nation, Unification of the Nation, and Globalization of the Nation.‚Äù Kim believed that South Korea, as a divided and vulnerable country surrounded by communist powers, could only be truly secure and prosperous if it was spiritually renewed through mass evangelism.
</p>
<p>
To put this into practice, CCC launched the ‚ÄúTen Million National Evangelization Movement‚Äù in 1980, right after the political unrest of the previous year and the beginning of the Chun Doo-hwan regime. According to Kim, the country‚Äôs political instability and moral decline were not primarily political or economic problems, but spiritual problems. In a famous address, he stated:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúEvangelizing the nation is the highest form of patriotism. We must save souls to save Korea.‚Äù<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188" role="doc-noteref"><sup>188</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The movement was not merely symbolic. CCC rapidly mobilized thousands of university students and lay Christians to spread the Gospel on campuses, in military barracks, and in neighborhoods across the country. It printed and distributed millions of evangelistic tracts, most notably the Four Spiritual Laws, a tool designed to present the Gospel in a simple, systematic format. Teams of students were trained to share their faith door-to-door, on public transportation, and at street corners. Mass events were held in auditoriums and stadiums to preach repentance and commitment to Christ.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980s, CCC organized a series of ‚ÄúHoly Spirit Evangelization Conferences‚Äù in major cities like Seoul, Daejeon, and Busan, attracting tens of thousands of participants each time. The climax came in 1983, when CCC hosted the Explos ‚Äô83 World Evangelization Conference at Jamsil Olympic Stadium. With an estimated attendance of over 200,000 people, the event was the largest Christian revival rally in Korean history at that time. There, Kim proclaimed that Korea‚Äôs divine mission was not only to receive the Gospel, but to send it to the ends of the earth. One of the central declarations from the platform was:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOnly a people armed with the Gospel can overcome communism.‚Äù<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189" role="doc-noteref"><sup>189</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Another major pillar of CCC‚Äôs strategy was military evangelism. In a country where all male citizens were required to serve in the army, CCC saw the military as a powerful mission field. It trained chaplains and lay evangelists, held rallies in barracks, and handed out Gospel tracts to soldiers. The act of bringing young men to Christ during their service was framed as both a spiritual victory and a form of national defense.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190" role="doc-noteref"><sup>190</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Internationally, CCC also developed a reverse mission strategy. Rather than only supporting Western missionaries coming into Korea, CCC envisioned Korean Christians taking the Gospel abroad‚Äîespecially to the large diaspora communities in the United States, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Korean students were sent overseas during summer mission trips, not only to support churches but also to evangelize other Asian peoples as part of CCC‚Äôs vision for Korea as a ‚ÄúGospel bridge‚Äù to the world.
</p>
<p>
To support and sustain this large-scale mobilization, CCC built a comprehensive discipleship training program. Students were enrolled in a four-stage progression: (1) Evangelism, (2) Maturity, (3) Commitment, and (4) Leadership. Bible studies, quiet time, and ‚Äúone-to-one‚Äù mentoring formed the core of this system. By 1985, CCC reported that over 100,000 Korean students had completed some form of this training. Many of these individuals would go on to become pastors, missionaries, teachers, and even politicians and corporate leaders who carried CCC‚Äôs moral and spiritual values into other sectors of society.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191" role="doc-noteref"><sup>191</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
However, despite its immense scale and influence, CCC faced growing criticism for its silence on key issues of justice and oppression. It did not make any official statements or public actions regarding the Gwangju Uprising of 1980, in which hundreds of citizens were killed by military forces. Nor did CCC participate in campaigns addressing labor exploitation, the plight of factory workers, or the suppression of civil liberties. For many young activists and theologians, this lack of engagement with political and social realities made CCC appear not only apolitical, but potentially aligned with the status quo. Some scholars later argued that CCC‚Äôs focus on personal morality and national spiritual destiny led to an unintended complicity with the authoritarian regime of the 1980s, which welcomed religious groups that stayed away from political dissent.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, CCC‚Äôs legacy is significant. It created a mass movement of evangelism and discipleship among students and young adults, equipped hundreds of missionaries, and contributed to shaping Korea‚Äôs identity as one of the world‚Äôs most active missionary-sending countries. But it also left behind a theological question that still lingers: Can a faith that ignores injustice still claim to represent the whole Gospel?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Democratization Stream: KSCF, YMCA, YWCA, and Ecumenical Solidarity</strong>
</p>
<p>
While the CCC led the evangelical wave of the 1980s, a distinct and deeply committed Christian student movement emerged in opposition to Korea‚Äôs military dictatorship. This movement was led by the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), in collaboration with urban YMCA branches, the YWCA, and Christian labor networks. These groups believed that Christianity could not be confined to private spirituality. For them, the Gospel demanded action in history‚Äîto stand with the oppressed, challenge unjust systems, and participate in national democratization.
</p>
<p>
The Gwangju Uprising in May 1980 became a defining event. As government troops massacred citizens protesting against Chun Doo-hwan‚Äôs illegitimate seizure of power, churches and major Christian organizations fell largely silent. But KSCF members, many of them students and youth leaders, could not remain passive. They interpreted the massacre as not just a political tragedy, but a theological crisis‚Äîa moment that forced Christians to choose between complicity and truth. In their public reflections, KSCF wrote: ‚ÄúTo remember Gwangju is a matter of Christian conscience. The path to resurrection must pass through the cross of Gwangju.‚Äù<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193" role="doc-noteref"><sup>193</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
At a time when public gatherings were banned under Emergency Law No. 9, KSCF held clandestine prayer meetings and memorial services on university campuses and in affiliated churches. Students risked arrest by gathering to pray for the victims, to proclaim God‚Äôs justice, and to condemn violence as sin. Government authorities closely monitored these events, and in several cases, KSCF staff were detained or interrogated under the National Security Law. In response to the trauma of Gwangju and the wider social discontent, KSCF reorganized its activities toward what it called ‚Äútheology on the ground.‚Äù In 1982, it formally launched the Student Social Development Corps (Haksa-dan)‚Äîa program where university students were sent not to conferences, but into the living conditions of the poor. Students moved into inner-city slums, lived with displaced communities in demolition zones, worked alongside factory laborers, and farmed with rural villagers. The aim was not to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the marginalized, but to learn from them what the Gospel truly meant. A former member recalled, ‚ÄúWe stopped asking, ‚ÄòWhat is salvation?‚Äô and started asking, ‚ÄòWhere is Jesus suffering today?‚Äô‚Äù<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194" role="doc-noteref"><sup>194</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This theology of presence and solidarity found institutional expression through the YMCA, particularly through student branches in universities. In 1983‚Äì84, Yonsei University YMCA launched the Namyangman Community Project, a bold initiative where students and local farmers formed intentional communities in rural areas. They worked together to plant rice, raise livestock, and run cooperatives, while holding Bible studies on economic justice and spiritual humility. Their belief was that ‚Äúlife in the countryside, rooted in community and simplicity, most closely resembles the Kingdom of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195" role="doc-noteref"><sup>195</sup></a> This project was not symbolic. Students physically relocated, committed to a rhythm of daily labor and shared faith, and documented the project as a model for Christian economic ethics.
</p>
<p>
In the cities, YWCA branches took on the struggle for women‚Äôs dignity and labor rights. The 1980s industrial boom had produced thousands of exploited female workers, many of them teenagers in sewing factories or electronics plants. The Seoul YWCA established labor counseling centers, where women could receive free legal assistance, attend rights education workshops, and find spiritual and emotional support. At the same time, Gwangju YWCA played a critical role during and after the Uprising. During the crackdown, it opened its facilities as shelters for injured citizens and fleeing students, defying martial law. In the following years, it became a site for trauma recovery programs, especially for women who had suffered loss or violence during the protests.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196" role="doc-noteref"><sup>196</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
As the movement matured, it became more organized. By 1986, a nationwide Christian Young Workers‚Äô Movement, working closely with YMCA and KSCF, mobilized thousands of Christian workers and students. That year, over 3,000 participants joined a public demonstration in Seoul, calling for fair labor policies, union protection, and the moral responsibility of Christian citizens.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197" role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a> At these gatherings, prayers were offered not just for spiritual renewal, but for a society free from corruption, injustice, and exploitation.
</p>
<p>
These actions represented more than just social concern. They embodied a theology rooted in minjung (people‚Äôs) theology, liberation theology, and contextual Bible reading. Students were no longer reading Scripture in abstract‚Äîthey read it in factories, protest sites, and villages. Christ was no longer found in the church building, but in the tear gas, the hunger strike, and the anonymous hands sewing clothes in midnight shifts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Comparison and Intersection</strong>
</p>
<p>
The difference between CCC and KSCF was more than strategy‚Äîit reflected fundamentally different interpretations of the Gospel. CCC emphasized individual salvation and moral renewal, while KSCF and ecumenical groups emphasized collective liberation and public justice. CCC saw political engagement as a potential distraction from spiritual mission. KSCF saw political passivity as a betrayal of Christian faith. Despite these differences, there were occasional moments of interaction and dialogue. On some campuses, students from both groups joined in joint Bible studies and social ethics seminars hosted by local churches. A few pastors encouraged mutual understanding and communication, though such attempts remained limited and often fragile. Public perception of the two movements was also deeply divided. Conservative churches and mainstream media praised CCC for restoring moral discipline among youth, while labeling KSCF and its allies as left-leaning or radical. Meanwhile, democratization activists and international ecumenical groups recognized KSCF, YMCA, and YWCA as rare sanctuaries of free discourse and social imagination under dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, these diverging paths raised a central question for Korean Christianity: What is the role of faith in a society marked by authoritarianism, poverty, and division? Is the Gospel primarily about saving individual souls‚Äîor transforming unjust systems? For student Christians in the 1980s, this was not a theoretical question. It was a lived and often dangerous reality.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conclusion: Between Gospel and Justice</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Christian student movements of the 1980s were not merely student ministry efforts. They represented a generation‚Äôs existential struggle over the meaning of faith in a time of national crisis. For CCC, faith meant passion for evangelism and a sense of patriotic spiritual calling. For KSCF, YMCA, and YWCA, faith demanded solidarity with the poor, prophetic resistance to injustice, and courage in the face of oppression.These two paths did not cancel each other out. Rather, they revealed the spiritual and theological breadth of Korean Protestantism. One stream deepened spiritual formation and missional fervor. The other widened the church‚Äôs ethical vision and social relevance. Looking back, they offer a mirror for today‚Äôs Christian community‚Äîa reminder that the Gospel can empower both personal transformation and collective liberation. The student movements of the 1980s continue to ask difficult questions: What does it mean to believe? Can prayer be protest? Can faith disturb injustice? These questions remain alive, urging new generations of Korean Christians to reflect, respond, and rediscover the Gospel in the world they inhabit.

<p>
Unification Movements
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the 1980s, the Korean Protestant Church‚Äôs attitude toward national unification underwent a significant transformation. What began as suspicion and passive resistance in the 1970s gradually gave way to bold theological and practical engagement by the late 1980s. This shift was not incidental‚Äîit reflected deep theological convictions, historical responsibility, and a renewed understanding of the Church‚Äôs role in society and mission.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why Was Unification Important to the Korean Church?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unification was not merely a political concern for the Korean Church‚Äîit was fundamentally tied to its faith, identity, and mission:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Faith Commitment: Unification as God‚Äôs Kingdom Movement<br> Unification was seen as a tangible expression of the Kingdom of God on earth‚Äîa space where peace, justice, and reconciliation could be practiced in full.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúPeaceful unification is a concrete manifestation of the Kingdom of God‚Äîwhere the strong and the weak live without discrimination and sing the song of hope.‚Äù<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198" role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Historical Responsibility<br> The Church acknowledged its complicity in the past, especially its silence or alignment with Cold War anti-communism that had often reinforced the logic of division. Unification was thus a way to seek repentance and fulfill its ethical duty toward the nation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúSome Korean churches openly contributed to solidifying the division of the Korean peninsula by misunderstanding or even opposing God‚Äôs peace.‚Äù<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199" role="doc-noteref"><sup>199</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Missional Calling: Reconciliation and Healing<br> Participation in unification was part of God‚Äôs ongoing mission (<em>Missio Dei</em>), calling churches to act as agents of healing and reconciliation. This meant embracing both North and South as one people in need of restored communion.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Preparing for Social Integration<br> Drawing on lessons from German reunification, the Korean Church recognized that unification without social integration was incomplete. Churches needed to take the lead in building mutual understanding, addressing trauma, and offering models of reconciled community (<em>Koinonia</em>).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúEven before political unification is achieved, the Church must live as a reconciled communion that anticipates the peace to come.‚Äù<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200" role="doc-noteref"><sup>200</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Restoring Fellowship with the Northern Church<br> Decades of division had severed ties between churches in the South and Christians in the North. Reunification meant restoring this broken fellowship and renewing the spiritual bonds of one people under God.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>From Suspicion to Engagement</strong>
</p>
<p>
The immediate catalyst for change came in 1981, when news broke of a dialogue between North Korea‚Äôs Christian Federation and overseas Korean Christians, held under the title <em>‚ÄúTalks among Northern and Overseas Christians on National Reunification.‚Äù</em> This meeting openly supported the 7.4 South-North Joint Statement and even discussed North Korea‚Äôs federal unification proposal. South Korean churches, initially shocked, began to reconsider their stance. According to historian Kim Heung-su:
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúThe Korean churches, while opposing the dialogue itself, were influenced by it and began their own contact with the North‚Äôs Christian Federation during the 1980s.‚Äù<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This shift culminated in 1988, when the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued the landmark ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Korean Christian Churches on National Reunification and Peace.‚Äù This declaration officially accepted the core principles of the 7.4 Joint Statement‚Äîself-reliance, peaceful unification, and great national unity‚Äîand reframed unification as a matter of Christian justice and reconciliation.
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúOnly in 1988 did the NCCK and its member denominations finally accept the 7.4 Joint Statement.‚Äù<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202" role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a><br> ‚ÄúNational unification and peace are not merely political projects; they are grounded in the gospel message of reconciliation and justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203" role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At the same time, theologians such as Lee Beom-seong and Shin Ok-soo developed a theology of peaceful unification, drawing from the experiences of German reunification and the concept of <em>Missio Dei</em>. They emphasized that the Church must fulfill both prophetic (preaching) and diaconal (service) roles.
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
‚ÄúEven if political unification has not yet occurred, the Korean Church must act now to embody reconciled communion (Koinonia).‚Äù<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204" role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>
<p>
Democratization Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Throughout the 1980s, Christianity in South Korea played a critical yet complex role in the nation‚Äôs democratization movement. Christian institutions, particularly progressive factions of Protestantism and the Catholic Church, became not only moral voices but also institutional bases for resistance. Their roles ranged from providing sanctuary for protestors to initiating transnational solidarity, while simultaneously revealing internal divisions, contradictions, and complicity in the era of rapid church growth<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205" role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christianity provided crucial organizational space and moral legitimacy for activists resisting authoritarianism. The Myeongdong Cathedral became a symbolic sanctuary, repeatedly sheltering student protesters and labor leaders. In the 1987 June Democratic Uprising, the cathedral served as the central sit-in site. As Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan famously stated in response to the state‚Äôs 1995 intrusion, ‚ÄúThis is a desecration of the birthplace of the very government that now violates it‚Äù<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206" role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Protestant organizations such as the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) and the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) played pivotal roles in the labor movement and in articulating a theology of resistance. The UIM, for instance, declared that ‚Äúthere can be no Kingdom of God on this earth where laborers are trampled‚Äù and established solidarity communities that bridged faith and class struggle<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207" role="doc-noteref"><sup>207</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ) emerged in direct response to the 1980 Gwangju Uprising. It declared, ‚ÄúGwangju is the Cross of our nation,‚Äù and transformed grief into ritual resistance through annual memorial Masses and international advocacy. The group‚Äôs activities‚Äîranging from exposing torture victims to issuing public denunciations‚Äîframed political resistance as an ethical duty of faith<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208" role="doc-noteref"><sup>208</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian groups also enabled international communication. WCC (World Council of Churches) and affiliated ecumenical organizations in Germany and Japan provided platforms through which South Korean dissidents informed global audiences, lobbied for political prisoners, and received financial and moral support. As Misook Lee argues, this ‚Äútransnational ecumenical network of communicative interaction‚Äù was crucial in circumventing domestic censorship<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209" role="doc-noteref"><sup>209</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the relationship between Christianity and democratization was not unilaterally supportive. Evangelical megachurches and conservative denominations often remained silent or even cooperative with the authoritarian state. Jin-ho Kim refers to this as ‚Äúanachronistic growth,‚Äù where the obsession with numerical expansion alienated Protestant churches from civil society and weakened public trust in religion<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210" role="doc-noteref"><sup>210</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Organizations like CCC (Campus Crusade for Christ) continued their mission of ‚ÄúEvangelizing the Nation, Unifying the Nation, Globalizing the Nation,‚Äù prioritizing large revival meetings over public engagement or critique of state violence. This divergence created clear ideological rifts between liberation theology‚Äìinspired movements and revivalist evangelicalism<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211" role="doc-noteref"><sup>211</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite these tensions, international scholars affirm the significant role of Christianity in Korea‚Äôs democratic transition. Samuel Huntington described the churches as ‚Äúthe principal forum for opposition‚Äù in the 1980s, while Bruce Cumings emphasized their role as ‚Äúsanctuaries immune from state intrusion‚Äù<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212" role="doc-noteref"><sup>212</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In sum, Christianity in 1980s South Korea occupied a paradoxical role‚Äîoffering moral refuge and international solidarity on one hand, and ideological conflict and institutional ambivalence on the other. This dual nature reflected broader questions of what it meant to be the church in times of authoritarian crisis<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213" role="doc-noteref"><sup>213</sup></a>.

<p>
Although the democratization and unification movements of the 1980s were two central forces shaping Korean society, they have often been treated as separate historical trajectories. Democratization has typically been viewed through the lens of political freedom and civil rights, while unification has been framed as an issue of diplomacy, security, and ideology. However, when examining the role of Christianity, it becomes clear that these two movements were deeply interconnected. The Church‚Äôs engagement in the democratization movement was an expression of its theological commitment to justice and human dignity, and its later turn toward the unification movement was a natural extension of that same moral responsibility‚Äîreaching beyond political change toward national reconciliation and healing.
</p>
<p>
A unified narrative allows us to see that Korean Christianity was not merely reacting to historical events but actively envisioning a new social order grounded in faith. When democratization and unification are treated separately, the Church‚Äôs role appears fragmented; when they are integrated, we can better understand how theological themes such as the practice of justice and the proclamation of reconciliation were embodied in history. It reveals the Church not just as a political actor but as a community acting out of spiritual conviction and historical accountability.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, writing a synthesis of democratization and unification movements is not only a matter of historical completeness‚Äîit is a necessary shift in perspective to grasp how faith communities responded holistically to the demands of their time. This integrated view challenges both the Church and civil society today to revisit the enduring questions of justice, peace, and communal life with renewed purpose.

<p>
Korean Christian Diaspora and the Movements for Democracy and Reunification
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the 1980s, Korean Christian communities in Germany, Japan, and the United States emerged as moral voices of resistance, reconciliation, and justice. Their movements did not divide democracy from reunification, nor did they separate faith from action. Rather, they offered a theology practiced in prayer, protest, and deep international solidarity. These movements grew out of distinct contexts, but were united by one question: what does it mean to be the church in an age of dictatorship, division, and diaspora?
</p>
<p>
This essay deliberately does not draw a hard line between democratization movements and reunification movements among overseas Korean Christians. For those involved, the struggle against authoritarianism and the longing for national unity were not separate causes. Both were expressions of a deeper theological and ethical conviction‚Äîthat justice could not stop at political reform, and peace could not be achieved without healing the division of the Korean people. As one pastor in Germany put it, ‚ÄúWe could not preach democracy on Sunday and forget the pain of division on Monday.‚Äù The pursuit of democracy and the dream of reunification flowed together in their prayers, petitions, and public acts of conscience.
</p>
<p>
By organizing this narrative thematically rather than separating by region or political category, we uncover the transnational structure of Korean Christian activism in the diaspora: a structure held together by faith, memory, moral clarity, and shared vulnerability. The lines between protest and prayer, between theology and testimony, were intentionally blurred by those who believed that to follow Christ meant to stand with the oppressed‚Äîwhether they lived under dictatorship or across a border sealed by war.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Germany<br> </strong>
</p>
<p>
The Korean Christian diaspora in West Germany emerged from a convergence of labor migration and theological reflection. Korean miners and nurses, sent under a bilateral labor agreement, found themselves immersed in German society while yearning for political change in Korea. Alongside them were theology students who saw the division of Korea and the repression of democracy as spiritual crises. Rev.&nbsp;Jang Sung-hwan, dispatched by the Korean National Council of Churches in 1972, quickly transformed his role from pastoral care to political education. In Bible studies, he taught labor law, human rights, and the theological meaning of resistance. ‚ÄúThe gospel,‚Äù he preached, ‚Äúis not an opiate‚Äîit is an alarm bell that wakes us to injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214" role="doc-noteref"><sup>214</sup></a> When the Yushin Constitution was declared, Jang led protests in Bonn and was eventually denied access to some worker dormitories. One administrator told him, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just a pastor, you‚Äôre a threat.‚Äù To this, Jang replied, ‚ÄúThen I follow the same path as the prophets of old.‚Äù<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215" role="doc-noteref"><sup>215</sup></a> The May 1980 Gwangju Uprising shook the Korean communities in cities like Bochum and Heidelberg. One miner recalled, ‚ÄúWe wept in the church basement all night. And in the morning, we began planning our protest.‚Äù<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216" role="doc-noteref"><sup>216</sup></a> These sentiments gave birth to the May People‚Äôs Festival in Europe, held annually since 1980. It became a site of liturgical resistance, combining poetry, lamentation, political education, and communal prayer. The theological framework for this movement was laid by Dr.&nbsp;Lee Young-bin, who proposed a ‚ÄúThird Space Theology‚Äù rooted in Karl Barth‚Äôs dialectical theology. ‚ÄúThe church must not stand with the Right or the Left,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúbut where God stands‚Äîin reconciliation.‚Äù<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217" role="doc-noteref"><sup>217</sup></a> He founded the Korean Christian Overseas Reunification Association, one of the earliest efforts to promote direct dialogue between South and North Korean churches. ‚ÄúFaith,‚Äù Lee said, ‚Äúmust be a bridge across ideologies, not a wall behind which we hide.‚Äù<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218" role="doc-noteref"><sup>218</sup></a>

<strong>Japan</strong>
</p>
<p>
In Japan, Korean Christians were not recent migrants but rather long-standing Zainichi residents‚Äîdescendants of colonial laborers and settlers. Their faith emerged in the margins of Japanese society, shaped as much by ethnic discrimination as by spiritual conviction. The Korean Christian Church in Japan (KCCJ) provided not only worship but also a center for political and social advocacy. In 1970, when Korean youth Park Jong-seok was denied a job by Hitachi due to his nationality, Rev. Lee In-ha, pastor of a KCCJ church in Kawasaki, responded by organizing a support network. This movement eventually grew into the Network Against Ethnic Discrimination, which documented injustices and mobilized a broad coalition for civil rights. ‚ÄúTo defend Park,‚Äù Lee said, ‚Äúis to defend the image of God in every marginalized person.‚Äù<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219" role="doc-noteref"><sup>219</sup></a> In the 1980s, KCCJ collaborated with the National Christian Council of Japan (NCCJ) to oppose the fingerprinting of foreign residents. In 1985, churches across Kawasaki and Tokyo declared a ‚ÄúKorean Human Rights Sunday‚Äù, during which 12 Korean residents publicly refused fingerprinting in an act of civil disobedience. Their declaration was bold: ‚ÄúWe are not criminals. We are children of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220" role="doc-noteref"><sup>220</sup></a> Beyond civil rights, the Japanese Christian network also played a pivotal role in North-South Korean dialogue. In 1984, the Tozanso Consultation marked the first postwar unofficial meeting of Christians from both Koreas, facilitated by Japanese churches. In 1986, at the Glion Meeting in Switzerland, South and North Korean church leaders shared communion. A KCCJ member later said, ‚ÄúWe cried. Not because we agreed on politics, but because we remembered we were one in Christ.‚Äù<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221" role="doc-noteref"><sup>221</sup></a>

<p>
<strong>United States</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Korean American Christian diaspora was socioeconomically diverse, including early immigrants, political refugees, and a rising generation of 1.5 and second-generation youth. But the Gwangju Massacre in 1980 became a spiritual turning point. Many Korean Americans who had remained silent now found their voice through their faith. Yoon Han-bong, a prominent Gwangju activist, arrived in Los Angeles after a dangerous escape from Korea. Instead of living quietly in exile, he founded Young Koreans United (YKU), a progressive Christian movement. He described it as ‚Äúmadang theology,‚Äù a courtyard theology rooted in community, activism, and reflection. ‚ÄúWe do not gather to escape. We gather to act,‚Äù he said.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222" role="doc-noteref"><sup>222</sup></a> YKU members lived in shared houses, organized political education programs, and launched campaigns for nuclear disarmament, North Korean human rights, and repatriation of unconverted prisoners. They also organized annual Gwangju commemorations, often inviting victim families and interfaith speakers. ‚ÄúReunification,‚Äù one YKU pamphlet read, ‚Äúis not a political slogan. It is a sacred promise‚Äîto mend what was broken, to return what was scattered.‚Äù<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223" role="doc-noteref"><sup>223</sup></a> The movement was grounded in churches. Thousands of Korean churches across the U.S. opened their spaces for prayer meetings and advocacy. In Los Angeles, the Thursday Prayer Meeting became a gathering where activism followed immediately after prayer. One young participant recalled, ‚ÄúWe would pray with tears. And after the ‚ÄòAmen,‚Äô someone would say, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs write to our congressman.‚Äô That‚Äôs what discipleship looked like.‚Äù<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224" role="doc-noteref"><sup>224</sup></a> YKU found broader support through the North America Human Rights Coalition (NHRK), which linked churches, NGOs, and U.S. policymakers. Their mission was clear: ‚ÄúFreedom is a God-given right. Gwangju is a global concern. The gospel does not remain silent.‚Äù<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225" role="doc-noteref"><sup>225</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Democracy and Reunification as One Spiritual Calling</strong>
</p>
<p>
In all three regions, Korean Christians did not draw sharp lines between democratization and reunification. They understood both as parts of a larger divine mandate‚Äîa call to heal division and oppose injustice.
</p>
<p>
In Germany, Lee Young-bin asserted that ‚ÄúTo speak of human rights without speaking of peace between North and South is to close one eye. The gospel sees with both eyes‚Äîtruth and reconciliation.‚Äù<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226" role="doc-noteref"><sup>226</sup></a> In Japan, Lee In-ha proclaimed, ‚ÄúWe are not simply Korean or Japanese citizens. We are watchmen for the marginalized across the world. Reunification is the cry of the displaced, and the hope of the divided.‚Äù<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227" role="doc-noteref"><sup>227</sup></a> And in America, Yoon Han-bong often reminded his followers: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want a democracy that ends at the DMZ. We want a Korea where no one is forgotten‚Äînorth or south, past or present. This is not politics. This is justice. This is faith.‚Äù<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228" role="doc-noteref"><sup>228</sup></a> These weren‚Äôt slogans. They were radical reinterpretations of Korean Christianity itself. Through liturgy and organizing, protests and petitions, diaspora churches became laboratories for a faith that refused to be neutral in history.

<p>
Charismatic-Conservative Conflict
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1980s was a period of rapid expansion for Korean Christianity, but it also witnessed intense theological confrontation. The rise of the Charismatic movement‚Äîemphasizing supernatural experiences such as speaking in tongues, healing, prophecy, and exorcism‚Äîprovoked strong opposition from conservative theology. Two central figures shaped this confrontation: Pastor David Yonggi Cho of the Yoido Full Gospel Church, and Pastor Ki Dong Kim of Sungnak Church and the Berea Academy.
</p>
<p>
Pastor Cho emphasized the Pentecostal doctrine of the ‚ÄúBaptism of the Holy Spirit,‚Äù combined with his signature ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù‚Äîsalvation of soul, healing of the body, and material prosperity. He taught, ‚ÄúThe gospel is not only about saving souls, but also healing diseases and liberating people from poverty‚Äù<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229" role="doc-noteref"><sup>229</sup></a>. His message resonated with a rapidly urbanizing and economically struggling population, helping the Yoido Full Gospel Church become the largest congregation in the world.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, Pastor Kim centered his ministry not only on spiritual gifts but on a unique theology of demon possession, the realm of the dead (Sheol), and angelic corruption. He argued, ‚ÄúDemons are the souls of deceased unbelievers, and even believers can be possessed‚Äù<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230" role="doc-noteref"><sup>230</sup></a>. He insisted that illnesses and life misfortunes result from demonic intrusion, and that only exorcism could solve them<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231" role="doc-noteref"><sup>231</sup></a>. He justified these teachings through thousands of cases he had allegedly experienced in ministry<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232" role="doc-noteref"><sup>232</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Conservative theologians responded strongly. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PROK) declared Pastor Cho‚Äôs theology ‚Äúpseudo-Christian,‚Äù citing concerns over his Threefold Blessing and a controversial ‚Äúresurrected maiden‚Äù testimony. However, Cho actively defended himself and clarified his doctrines. By 1993, the PROK lifted the heresy label after review<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233" role="doc-noteref"><sup>233</sup></a>. Cho‚Äôs theology remained within the bounds of orthodoxy, as he upheld traditional doctrines like the Trinity and salvation<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234" role="doc-noteref"><sup>234</sup></a>. In contrast, Pastor Kim faced a series of formal heresy verdicts from PROK, Hapdong, Koshin, and the Baptist Convention. His view that demons are souls of the dead clashed with biblical demonology, which traditionally identifies demons as fallen angels<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235" role="doc-noteref"><sup>235</sup></a>. His claim that ‚Äúthe entire world is Sheol, a place where these spirits roam,‚Äù was seen as a distortion of Christian eschatology<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236" role="doc-noteref"><sup>236</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This controversy revealed not merely doctrinal disagreements, but a deeper cultural-theological divide. Conservative theology, grounded in systematic exegesis and Reformed orthodoxy, values order, liturgy, and objective scriptural authority. The Charismatic movement, by contrast, emphasized experiential faith, direct emotional encounter with the Holy Spirit, and practical results such as healing and financial blessings<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237" role="doc-noteref"><sup>237</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs theology went further: he linked demons to physical illness, suicide, addiction, and mental distress, and taught that exorcism was necessary for deliverance. ‚ÄúDemons, as the spirits of unbelievers, wander the earth until their natural lifespan is completed,‚Äù he claimed. ‚ÄúThey cause all misfortunes, and must be driven out through spiritual warfare‚Äù<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238" role="doc-noteref"><sup>238</sup></a>. For many conservative theologians, this resembled shamanism cloaked in Christian terminology. Cho, on the other hand, avoided explicit doctrinal conflict. Though criticized for emphasizing blessing and prosperity, he did not promote doctrinal deviations. He maintained ongoing dialogue with denominations and steered the Yoido church toward global evangelical legitimacy, eventually chairing the World Assemblies of God Fellowship (WAGF)<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239" role="doc-noteref"><sup>239</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
From 1985 onward, Kim was officially condemned as a heretic by most major denominations in Korea. He separated from the institutional church, establishing Sungnak Church as an independent body and rejecting dialogue. His theology was never reconciled with Protestant orthodoxy<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240" role="doc-noteref"><sup>240</sup></a>. Cho, in contrast, re-engaged with the institutional church, clarified his teachings, and had the pseudo-Christian label lifted. His church became a model for global charismatic growth, especially among non-Western churches.

Creationist Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The creationist movement in South Korea, though influenced by American conservative evangelicalism, developed distinctive patterns through its institutional entrenchment, intra-evangelical conflicts, and eventually, public backlash.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, creation science gained traction as a quasi-academic movement through the establishment of the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) in 1981. The founders, including physicist Kim Young-gil, envisioned creation science as an apologetic alternative to evolutionary biology. They emphasized ‚Äúscientific evidence‚Äù for a literal reading of Genesis, and Kim declared, ‚ÄúThe Bible is the true science textbook‚Äù<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241" role="doc-noteref"><sup>241</sup></a>‚Äã. The KACR‚Äôs publications, such as <em>Is Evolution Scientific Fact?</em> (1981), quickly spread through churches and student ministries. By the 1990s, creationism had become mainstream within Korean evangelical circles. KACR expanded its influence through public lectures, textbooks like <em>Ï∞ΩÏ°∞Î°† ÎåÄÍ∞ïÏ¢å</em> (1996), and science-themed exhibitions. The creation science exhibit at KAIST, established in 1993, stood as a symbolic validation of their scientific credibility‚Äã. Yet their approach remained focused on <em>young-earth creationism</em> (YEC) and a singular global flood model, resisting broader academic critique.
</p>
<p>
A major turning point occurred when Professor Yang Seung-hoon‚Äîa prominent KACR member‚Äîbegan to adopt a position closer to <em>old-earth, multi-catastrophe creationism</em>. In 2006, he published <em>Creation and Catastrophe</em> and asked his publisher to withdraw his previous YEC textbook from circulation. Yang stated, ‚ÄúYoung-earth creationism is certainly wrong; I see no need to cling to it anymore‚Äù<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242" role="doc-noteref"><sup>242</sup></a>‚Äã. This shift, initially overlooked by KACR leadership, soon triggered institutional rupture.
</p>
<p>
In 2007, Yang and theologian Cho Deok-young launched the Open Forum for Creationists to foster pluralistic dialogue among Christians interested in creation. Its motto welcomed ‚Äúanyone with an open mind toward different theological and scientific interpretations of creation‚Äù<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243" role="doc-noteref"><sup>243</sup></a>. The forum hosted academic symposia and published nearly 200 articles from 2007 to 2017. Topics included intelligent design, old-earth models, and critiques of YEC. This marked a decisive shift from popular apologetics to scholarly engagement. However, the forum‚Äôs pluralism provoked backlash. In 2008, KACR formally expelled Yang Seung-hoon for promoting old-earth views. Their justification cited over 30 non-peer-reviewed sources and was led by a faculty member in web design, not geology<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244" role="doc-noteref"><sup>244</sup></a>. Even CCC founder Kim Joon-gon, who had supported KACR since its inception, called Yang directly to request he shut down the Open Forum‚Äîan appeal Yang respectfully declined<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245" role="doc-noteref"><sup>245</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the rise of theistic evolution further diversified Korea‚Äôs evangelical discourse. Figures like Woo Jong-hak and Choi Seung-eon, both physicists trained in the U.S., publicly challenged YEC. Woo founded <em>Dialogue Between Science and Theology (Í≥ºÏã†ÎåÄ)</em> and gained traction among younger Christians via social media. His proposed lectures were repeatedly canceled by conservative institutions, including Handong University and Chongshin University, due to theological backlash<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246" role="doc-noteref"><sup>246</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The conflict reached the public sphere in 2012, when the Society for Textbook Revise (STR)‚Äîan offshoot of KACR‚Äîsuccessfully petitioned the Ministry of Education to remove references to <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and horse evolution from high school science textbooks. The ministry did not consult scientific experts and merely relayed the petition to publishers, many of whom complied<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247" role="doc-noteref"><sup>247</sup></a>. Evolutionary biologist Jang Dae-kyung lamented, ‚ÄúThere are only 5‚Äì10 evolutionary scientists in the country‚Ä¶ the scientific community has done little to resist‚Äù<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248" role="doc-noteref"><sup>248</sup></a>‚Äã. This moment marked global embarrassment. <em>Nature</em> and <em>Scientific American</em> ran critical features, warning that Korea had surrendered to pseudoscience in a way unmatched even in the U.S.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249" role="doc-noteref"><sup>249</sup></a>. The backlash prompted some officials to reverse the decision later that year. Then, in 2017, under President Moon Jae-in, the nomination of Park Seong-jin‚Äîa KACR board member‚Äîfor Small and Medium Business Minister sparked national uproar. In a confirmation hearing, Park claimed, ‚ÄúThe age of the Earth differs between science and faith,‚Äù and acknowledged belief in a 6,000-year-old Earth ‚Äúin church‚Äù while accepting older ages ‚Äúscientifically.‚Äù This dual-language undermined his credibility, and he withdrew within weeks<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250" role="doc-noteref"><sup>250</sup></a>. After Park‚Äôs resignation, KACR saw a decline in young scholars‚Äô participation. According to internal sources, even co-authoring a paper with creationists became politically risky. The momentum of the movement, once buoyed by mass appeal and church support, was now facing institutional and cultural marginalization.

Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
During the 1980s, the Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) movement in South Korea marked not merely the introduction of a new genre but a transformational shift in the form of worship, spiritual expression, and the church‚Äôs engagement with youth and culture. Praise teams emerged as a key force driving the transition from traditional, choir-led services to participatory, emotion-centered worship that resonated deeply with modern sensibilities. In contrast to many Western churches, Korean churches saw this transformation spread rapidly and broadly, due to structural, cultural, and socio-political conditions unique to Korea during this era.
</p>
<p>
Among the leading figures of this transformation was Choi Deok-sin, who founded <em>Joochan-yang Missionary Group</em> in 1981 and began composing CCM pieces that blended modern musical techniques with deeply theological messages. His iconic song ‚ÄúHis Name‚Äù, based on a poem by Song Myung-hee and released in 1985, sold over 300,000 copies‚Äîan unprecedented achievement that helped shift Christian music from the category of gospel songs to an emerging identity as CCM<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251" role="doc-noteref"><sup>251</sup></a>. The piece used suspended chords (sus4, sus9), syncopation, dotted rhythms, and triplets‚Äîharmonic elements rarely seen in earlier Korean Christian music‚Äîto convey what he called ‚Äúthe awe and mystery of Jesus‚Äù<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252" role="doc-noteref"><sup>252</sup></a>. Choi was not only a composer but also served as a producer, mentoring and producing albums for later CCM artists such as Park Jong-ho, Song Jung-mi, and Choi In-hyuk. His contribution to the sonic and aesthetic framework of Korean CCM positions him as a ‚Äúproducer of worship culture‚Äù rather than a mere musician<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253" role="doc-noteref"><sup>253</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The 1980s also saw the emergence of the Praise &amp; Worship movement through the influence of international worship ministries such as the UK‚Äôs Praise &amp; Worship series. Ha Yong-in (Hasdeban) played a key role in introducing this style in 1987, and the Duranno Thursday Praise gatherings institutionalized a ‚Äúcelebratory‚Äù model of worship that included drums, synthesizers, and even liturgical dance. ‚ÄúThe shift to celebratory worship was a revolution,‚Äù writes one researcher, ‚Äúespecially in a time when preaching had been the entirety of worship‚Äù<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254" role="doc-noteref"><sup>254</sup></a>. ‚ÄúJesus Abbey and Youth With A Mission (YWAM) helped lead the praise gatherings in Korea that adapted the structure and spirit of Vineyard-style worship‚Äù<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255" role="doc-noteref"><sup>255</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Christian broadcasting played a vital role in the spread and popularization of CCM. Stations like CBS and Far East Broadcasting Company aired programs such as <em>Gospel Hour</em>, <em>Songs of Peace and Love</em>, and <em>Truly Joyful Songs</em>, introducing both domestic and international CCM to broader audiences. <em>Gospel Hour</em>, hosted by singer-songwriter Ha Deok-kyu in 1989, became a milestone for CCM‚Äôs nationwide dissemination<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256" role="doc-noteref"><sup>256</sup></a>.

CCM was not limited to musical aesthetics‚Äîit also became a key part of Korea‚Äôs Christian movements in the 1980s, connecting deeply with spiritual and social agendas such as reunification prayer meetings, healing ministries, and youth revival camps. Worship teams were central to these gatherings, fostering communal emotion and theological reflection through song.
</p>
<p>
A representative piece is Koh Hyung-won‚Äôs ‚ÄúAs the Waters Cover the Sea,‚Äù a praise anthem whose repeated declaration‚Äî‚ÄúThe knowledge of the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea‚Äù‚Äîhelped unite congregants in corporate hope and mission<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257" role="doc-noteref"><sup>257</sup></a>. Another major figure was Kim Do-hyun, who carried the legacy of 1980s CCM aesthetics into the 2000s with fresh innovation. His hit ‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit Has Come‚Äù integrated blues harmonies and rich harmonic tensions, expanding the musical vocabulary of Korean worship music<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258" role="doc-noteref"><sup>258</sup></a>. His albums were structured as narrative works with theological and healing themes, such as his collaboration with filmmaker Kim Woo-hyun on the documentary <em>Beatitudes</em>.
</p>
<p>
The 1980s was also a time of domestication of imported gospel music. Korean composers like Kim Suk-kyun, Joo Sook-il, and Kim Min-sik began producing original works infused with Korean emotional sensibilities and spiritual themes. These works helped transform imported gospel into a contextualized, indigenous expression of Korean Christianity<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259" role="doc-noteref"><sup>259</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, this decade should be understood not as a period of mere musical introduction but as the formative era of Korean CCM. Four key features emerged: (1) the establishment of CCM as a distinct genre; (2) the shift from traditional choir worship to participatory praise; (3) the rise of artist-led production and distribution; and (4) the use of CCM as a strategic tool for cultural evangelism and youth ministry. This foundation laid the groundwork for the 1990s industrialization of worship, concert-style services, and the global export of Korean CCM. Ultimately, CCM in 1980s Korea became both ‚Äúan art that structures worship‚Äù and ‚Äúa cultural vehicle for experiencing the Gospel.‚Äù It redefined how churches engaged with society, and how believers expressed their faith‚Äîwith beauty, passion, and sound.

Theological and Political Fault Lines in Minjung Theology
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Minjung theology emerged in the 1970s as a contextual liberation theology rooted in the suffering and resistance of Korea‚Äôs working class and marginalized populations. Deeply influenced by both Latin American liberation theology and Korea‚Äôs turbulent democratization process, it offered a theological alternative to both Western dogmatism and politically conservative Korean churches. However, the 1980s marked a critical turning point‚Äînot only because of the theological sophistication of Minjung thinkers, but also due to intensified internal tensions and external criticisms. Three core controversies that defined Minjung theology in the 1980s are: its confrontation with conservative Christian orthodoxy, internal disagreements over the identity and role of the Minjung, and feminist critiques that exposed its gendered limitations. These debates did not signal the end of Minjung theology but rather enabled its renewal and transformation into a broader theological discourse of justice, solidarity, and intersectionality.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Heresy or Prophecy? Conflict with Conservative Churches</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the most persistent challenges facing Minjung theology in the 1980s was the accusation of heresy. Conservative Protestant denominations such as the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Hapdong) and the Kosin Church viewed Minjung theology not as an indigenous theological movement but as an ideological threat contaminated by Marxism and influenced by Latin American radicalism. Theologians like Ahn Byung-mu and Suh Nam-dong were often denied teaching platforms, and church publications warned believers against ‚Äúpro-North Korean theology.‚Äù One pastor famously stated, <em>‚ÄúMinjung theology does not teach faith in Christ‚Äîit seeks to replace Christ with the Minjung as redeemer.‚Äù</em><a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260" role="doc-noteref"><sup>260</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The heart of the conflict lay in biblical hermeneutics. Minjung theologians interpreted Scripture through the lens of lived suffering and collective resistance. Ahn‚Äôs reading of the <em>ochlos</em> in the Gospel of Mark redefined the crowd not as a passive mob but as active historical agents who stood with Jesus against the religious elite<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261" role="doc-noteref"><sup>261</sup></a>. For conservatives committed to scriptural literalism and theological orthodoxy, this was a dangerous politicization of the gospel. Craig L. Mulling characterizes this conflict as a ‚Äúdiscursive battle between orthodoxy and heterodoxy.‚Äù He writes, <em>‚ÄúMinjung theology used the language of liberation to justify moral purification through resistance, while conservative theology used the language of orthodoxy to sanctify state violence and developmental authoritarianism.‚Äù</em><a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262" role="doc-noteref"><sup>262</sup></a> This clash reached its peak when the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)‚Äîa body supportive of Minjung theology‚Äîissued the 1988 ‚ÄúDeclaration on the Peaceful Reunification of the Korean People.‚Äù The declaration called division a sin and proclaimed that Christians had a moral duty to support reunification efforts<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263" role="doc-noteref"><sup>263</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The backlash was immediate. Conservative leaders claimed the NCCK was legitimizing the North Korean regime and betraying national security. In response, they established the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) in 1989 as an alternative ecumenical body, explicitly rejecting NCCK‚Äôs ‚Äúpro-communist‚Äù theology<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264" role="doc-noteref"><sup>264</sup></a>. The two councils embodied not only different theological frameworks but divergent political theologies: the NCCK emphasized justice and reconciliation, while the CCK advocated gospel-centered reunification through evangelization of the North<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265" role="doc-noteref"><sup>265</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fragmentation Within: Competing Definitions of the Minjung</strong>
</p>
<p>
While external critics condemned Minjung theology as political heresy, internal tensions were also mounting‚Äîespecially over the definition of the ‚ÄúMinjung.‚Äù Although the term literally means ‚Äúthe people,‚Äù its theological content varied widely. Ahn Byung-mu viewed the Minjung as historical agents of resistance, symbolized by the <em>ochlos</em>, who confronted structural injustice alongside Jesus. Suh Nam-dong, by contrast, emphasized the existential suffering of the Minjung as those who bore <em>han</em>‚Äîa deep, unresolved pain rooted in oppression and historical trauma.
</p>
<p>
Yi Sam-yeol sought to move beyond both symbolic resistance and existential pathos by positioning the Minjung within civil society. He proposed that Minjung theology evolve into a ‚Äúpublic theology‚Äù aligned with democratic institutions. <em>‚ÄúThe Minjung,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúmust now appear not only in resistance but also as citizens asserting their dignity within institutions.‚Äù</em><a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266" role="doc-noteref"><sup>266</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These divergent interpretations raised theological questions about whether Minjung theology could maintain coherence without a shared anthropology. Hwang Yong-yeon‚Äôs later writings reflected this tension when he argued that ‚Äúthe Minjung are no longer a people‚Äîthey are a position revealed in suffering‚Äù<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267" role="doc-noteref"><sup>267</sup></a>. Such conceptual shifts forced the movement to grapple with questions of historical subjectivity, symbolic representation, and theological boundaries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Feminist Interventions: Gender Blindness and Theological Renewal</strong>
</p>
<p>
The most piercing critique of Minjung theology in the 1980s came from feminist theologians, who challenged the movement‚Äôs male-dominated structure and theological framework. Chun Hyung-Kyung captured the essence of this critique when she declared, <em>‚ÄúWomen are the Minjung within the Minjung. Under the name of the people, women have again been silenced.‚Äù</em><a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268" role="doc-noteref"><sup>268</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Feminist critiques highlighted the way Minjung theology prioritized the experience of male industrial workers, while neglecting domestic laborers, rural women, and victims of state-sanctioned sexual violence. For Chun, Minjung theology replicated patriarchal patterns under the guise of liberation. Park Soon-Kyung extended this critique through a theological lens. As a key architect of reunification theology, she insisted that national reconciliation must be grounded in maternal spirituality and women‚Äôs experiences of caregiving and embodiment. <em>‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs theology is the spiritual foundation of reunification,‚Äù</em> she wrote, <em>‚Äúand it begins in God‚Äôs maternal image.‚Äù</em><a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269" role="doc-noteref"><sup>269</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
These feminist interventions expanded Minjung theology beyond class-based oppression, pushing it to confront the intersectionality of gender, violence, and the symbolic language of salvation. This opened space for what would later become feminist Minjung theology‚Äîa discourse centered not on resistance alone, but on healing, memory, and relational ethics.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Minjung theology stood at a crossroads. Externally, it was condemned as heretical and politically subversive; internally, it struggled with competing definitions of its core terms and growing critiques from feminist and regional voices. Yet these very debates were what transformed Minjung theology from a doctrinal movement into a living discourse. Rather than signaling fragmentation or decline, the controversies of the 1980s enabled Minjung theology to undergo a necessary metamorphosis. Through theological debate, ecclesial resistance, and the inclusion of new voices, it evolved into a multi-vocal theology of justice and intersectional solidarity. In so doing, Minjung theology remained faithful to its original task: to interpret the gospel from the underside of history.
</p>

Theology from Women‚Äôs Perspective
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1980s in South Korea was a time when the streets echoed with cries for democratization, and within churches, the long-silenced voices of women began to emerge. In this climate, feminist theology did not merely seek to argue for women‚Äôs rights within the church; it sought to radically reframe theological language, structures, and the very imagination of God. What began as questions within the church matured into a full-fledged theological movement‚Äîone that aimed to upend the theological paradigm itself. This movement originated from a challenge to the language structure of the Korean church, where women‚Äôs silence had long been normalized. Feminist theologians pointed out that the male-centered language of the church‚Äîparticularly addressing God solely as ‚ÄúFather‚Äù‚Äîcontributed to the erasure of women‚Äôs experience and existence. Jung Hyun-sook stated, ‚ÄúIs God male? The Bible doesn‚Äôt say so, but that‚Äôs what we believe. And that belief has structurally deleted the presence of women‚Äù<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270" role="doc-noteref"><sup>270</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
These claims drew sharp criticism from conservative theologians. A theology chair from a major conservative denomination publicly condemned the phrase ‚ÄúMother God‚Äù as ‚Äúradical feminism that destroys the Bible and leans toward heresy.‚Äù In response, Kim Eun-hee stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not feminizing God‚Äîwe‚Äôre dismantling the patriarchal imagination that insists God must be male‚Äù<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271" role="doc-noteref"><sup>271</sup></a>. This debate over language quickly evolved into a larger question: Who has the authority to interpret God? Whose experience is theology allowed to speak of?
</p>
<p>
Another critical controversy centered on the ordination of women. Beginning in the mid-1980s, feminist theologians launched theological and institutional efforts to secure the legitimacy of women‚Äôs ordination. However, most denominations either flatly rejected or tactically avoided the issue. Jung Mi-hyun declared at a seminar, ‚ÄúA woman‚Äôs calling is not granted by the church‚Äîit is given by God. And the church has closed its ears to that call‚Äù<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272" role="doc-noteref"><sup>272</sup></a>. These discussions were not adequately described by the term ‚Äúchurch feminism.‚Äù Rather, they possessed a subversive theological character. During this time, feminist theology deepened its engagement with Minjung theology. While Minjung theology spoke of ‚Äúthe God of the oppressed,‚Äù feminist theologians pointed out that the image of the oppressed was overwhelmingly male. Kim Eun-hee asked, ‚ÄúIs the woman dying in the kitchen not a Minjung? Is a woman who sells her body for her family, only to be condemned for it, not today‚Äôs oppressed?‚Äù<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273" role="doc-noteref"><sup>273</sup></a> Thus, feminist theology both embraced and critiqued Minjung theology‚Äîsharing its structural analysis of oppression while confronting its gender exclusion. It became clear that feminist theology was not simply a supplement to existing theology; it sought to re-center theological discourse itself.
</p>
<p>
In 1987, several attempts were made to formally introduce feminist theology courses at institutions such as Methodist Theological University, Ewha Womans University‚Äôs School of Theology, and Hanshin University. These efforts were met with fierce resistance. Some professors and conservative denominational figures claimed such teachings would ‚Äúideologize theological education‚Äù<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274" role="doc-noteref"><sup>274</sup></a>. One professor at MTU reportedly argued that feminist theology courses would ‚Äúundermine ecclesiastical order,‚Äù and some classes were forced to operate as unofficial seminars. Despite this, students and women‚Äôs organizations mobilized to support the courses. A student from one such class said afterward, ‚ÄúFor the first time, I felt I was allowed to speak. The church told me to stay silent, but the Bible told me to speak‚Äù<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275" role="doc-noteref"><sup>275</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Another wave of opposition came in the form of labeling feminist theology as heretical. Conservative critics argued that it was rooted in ‚Äúideological feminism‚Äù rather than Christian doctrine, and some public lectures by feminist theologians were cancelled or banned. Jung Hyun-sook responded in a lecture, ‚ÄúWe are not abandoning doctrine‚Äîwe are speaking on behalf of those whom doctrine has abandoned. That is the recovery of the gospel‚Äù<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276" role="doc-noteref"><sup>276</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of the decade, feminist theology expanded into discourses of life, the body, and ecology, challenging anthropocentric salvation doctrines and domination-centered theology. Eco-feminist theology emerged, aiming to build a ‚Äúlife-giving theology.‚Äù Kim Young-joo argued, ‚ÄúThe Genesis command to ‚Äòsubdue and rule over‚Äô has operated as language of oppression for both nature and women. We must begin a theology that listens again to life‚Äù<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277" role="doc-noteref"><sup>277</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the 1980s marked the beginning of international solidarity for Korean feminist theologians. They engaged with the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EATWOT), and other global networks to build shared feminist theological discourse. At the 1988 Asian Women Theologians Conference in Manila, the declaration ‚ÄúPatriarchal theology kills our God‚Äù was read aloud. Korean theologians were present, connecting Korean feminist theology to a wider global theological movement<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278" role="doc-noteref"><sup>278</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Feminist theological thought in Korea initially emerged through challenges to gender discrimination within the church‚Äîcalls for voice, presence, and equality. These were often received as internal reforms or seen through the lens of liberal feminism. But as feminist theologians began generating their own theological vocabulary, frameworks, and communities, they moved beyond the boundaries of ecclesiastical critique. They posed radical questions about who theology exists for, how God is imagined, and what it means to speak of salvation from the perspective of the silenced and wounded.
</p>
<p>
This marked a paradigm shift from calls for inclusion to the construction of an alternative theological worldview. Feminist theology in Korea did not stop at asking for room in the existing house‚Äîit sought to rebuild the house altogether.

<br> Your Answer:
</h3>
<p>
North Korean Christianity in the 1980s
</p>
<p>
The 1980s marked a complex era for Christianity in North Korea, characterized not only by repression but also by a tactical reconfiguration of religious policy in response to international scrutiny. This period saw the regime simultaneously suppressing underground Christian communities while leveraging state-controlled religion for diplomatic purposes‚Äîcreating a dual structure of religious life that endures today.
</p>
<p>
In 1980, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) initiated contact with the World Council of Churches (WCC), which signaled a strategic shift. The North Korean regime began to see religion‚Äîspecifically Christianity‚Äînot just as a threat, but as a potential tool of international engagement. From 1981 to 1984, North Korean delegates attended ecumenical conferences in Vienna, Helsinki, and Dozan, where they raised human rights issues in South Korea and promoted narratives aligned with DPRK policy. These interactions were not signs of religious openness but carefully orchestrated diplomatic maneuvers.
</p>
<p>
Domestically, the regime simultaneously revived the Pyongyang Seminary in 1974, placing it under KCF control. The seminary operated with about 10 students per cohort in a three-year program. ‚ÄúPyongyang Seminary operates on a three-year cycle, with about ten students per class. Since its first graduates in 1974, over 100 have completed the program by 2002.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279" role="doc-noteref"><sup>279</sup></a> Graduates were dispatched as evangelists to Bongsu and Chilgol churches, eventually receiving ordination. However, the curriculum emphasized loyalty to Kim Il Sung and Juche ideology over biblical theology, turning the institution into a mechanism of religious control rather than a true theological school.
</p>
<p>
This strategy was most visibly embodied in the construction of Bongsu Church, which officially opened on November 6, 1988. Built in preparation for the 1989 Pyongyang World Festival of Youth and Students, the church was intended to project an image of religious tolerance. A pastor involved in the building of Bongsu Church recalled: ‚ÄúRehearsals were held the day before any foreign visitor arrived. The congregation and service were scripted ahead of time.‚Äù<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280" role="doc-noteref"><sup>280</sup></a> Attendees were handpicked Party loyalists, and sermons followed government-approved scripts. Bongsu Church functioned less as a space of worship and more as a religious stage for the benefit of foreign observers.
</p>
<p>
Religious infrastructure was further expanded with the publication of home-use Bibles and hymnals in 1983. Although this appeared to reflect an easing of religious repression, it remained tightly controlled. In the early 1990s, about 10,000 copies of state-approved Bibles and hymnals were printed in cooperation with the United Bible Societies and distributed to Bongsu and Chilgol churches. ‚ÄúIt is believed that some expressions in the Bible were altered to avoid conflict with Juche ideology.‚Äù<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281" role="doc-noteref"><sup>281</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
North Korean hymnals, unlike those used in the South, featured only lyrics without musical notation and were based on pre-1945 songs. ‚ÄúThey excluded emotionally expressive hymns or those reflecting South Korean theological trends.‚Äù<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282" role="doc-noteref"><sup>282</sup></a> This editorial choice reflected the regime‚Äôs discomfort with the emotive and potentially subversive power of Christian worship. Behind these officially sanctioned institutions, however, lay a persistent underground church. During the 1966‚Äì1969 nationwide classification campaign, over 20,000 Christian households (about 70,000 individuals) were forcibly relocated to remote mountainous and mining regions.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283" role="doc-noteref"><sup>283</sup></a> There, underground believers organized clandestine worship‚Äîmemorizing scripture, gathering in homes, and sharing faith in secret. By the mid-1980s, Pyongyang alone reportedly had at least 100 underground house churches, with approximately 1,000 registered believers, though unofficial estimates put the number of underground Christians at around 100,000.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284" role="doc-noteref"><sup>284</sup></a> These communities often relied on charismatic experiences‚Äîhealing, visions, tongues‚Äîas sources of spiritual authority. ‚ÄúEvangelism wouldn‚Äôt work without miracles,‚Äù one defector recalled.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285" role="doc-noteref"><sup>285</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The early 1980s also saw significant shifts in how underground Christians engaged with the state. In anticipation of the 6th Party Congress in 1980, the regime declared a partial amnesty for certain ‚Äúhostile class‚Äù individuals, including former Christians. Some of these individuals returned from exile and rejoined clandestine church networks. KCF Secretary Ko Ki-jun stated in 1981 that ‚Äúthere are more than 500 places of worship nationwide,‚Äù<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286" role="doc-noteref"><sup>286</sup></a> suggesting that some level of house-church revival was occurring under strict surveillance.
</p>
<p>
Still, this era was also marked by continued repression. According to the extensive documentation by Pastor Ban Suk Lee, at least 16,984 Christians were executed or imprisoned for their faith between 1945 and 2006, with 761 recorded cases, many occurring during the 1980s.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287" role="doc-noteref"><sup>287</sup></a> Common offenses included possession of a Bible, leading secret services, or evangelizing‚Äîany of which could result in imprisonment, torture, or execution.
</p>
<p>
In the border regions of Ryanggang and North Hamgyong, the late 1980s saw the emergence of a second-generation underground movement. North Koreans who had encountered Christianity while in China returned and began organizing home worship among their families. Their faith was shaped by experiential theology‚Äîfocused on dreams, healing, and prophecy.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288" role="doc-noteref"><sup>288</sup></a> One defector recounted, ‚ÄúWe hid the Bible under our pillows and prayed under blankets so no sound would escape. Those caught disappeared without a trace.‚Äù Accounts like these appear throughout defector testimonies and books such as <em>More Thirsty Than Starving</em> and <em>Evangelism Means Death</em>, reflecting the brutal risks of faith in North Korea during this time.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289" role="doc-noteref"><sup>289</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, Christianity in 1980s North Korea operated under a paradoxical system: state-controlled religious institutions served propaganda purposes, while authentic Christian faith survived in the shadows through suffering and resilience. This dual structure‚Äîbetween ceremonial religion and persecuted faith‚Äîwould shape North Korean religious policy into the 1990s and beyond, especially amid famine and growing international humanitarian engagement.
