<p>
Kim Young-sam‚Äôs political and religious engagement in the 1990s must be understood not merely as a milestone in Korea‚Äôs democratization but as a defining moment in the politicization of Protestant Christianity in South Korea. As the first ‚ÄúElder-President‚Äù of South Korea, Kim Young-sam embodied the convergence of religious conviction and political ambition, marking a profound shift in the relationship between church and state.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs 1992 presidential campaign marked a turning point in Korean Protestant political activism. As a well-known elder of Chungguhyun Church, Kim received enthusiastic support from conservative Protestant circles. At the height of the campaign, a ‚Äúprayer breakfast for candidate Kim Young-sam was held at the 63 Building in Seoul, attended by over 1,000 pastors, showcasing the consolidated political power of Protestantism‚Äù<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Slogans such as ‚ÄúLet a believer win the election‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet hymns echo from Jangwi-dae‚Äù were shouted across churches nationwide<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the most significant events in this context was the 1992 declaration titled <em>‚ÄúThe Future of Korean Politics Is in the Hands of Christianity,‚Äù</em> held at the Christian Cultural Center in Seoul. This meeting marked the first time Protestant leaders openly claimed a political mandate, asserting, ‚ÄúChristianity can no longer remain neutral in politics‚Äù<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>]. Organized by leading pastors from megachurches such as Yoido Full Gospel Church and Chungguhyun Church, the declaration set the precedent for large-scale religious intervention in elections. It also promoted a narrative that pitted Protestantism against rival religious influences, particularly Buddhism and Catholicism.
</p>
<p>
The Protestant mobilization went far beyond simple endorsements. As Kim Young-sam declared, ‚ÄúI will not campaign on Sundays,‚Äù appealing directly to Protestant sensibilities and gaining the trust of churchgoers who viewed Sabbath observance as sacred<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Conservative Christian leaders responded by establishing prayer cells and holding election seminars in over 170 regions under the slogan of national evangelization. ‚ÄúWhat had previously been silent support now became a well-organized electoral force,‚Äù effectively turning churches into campaign hubs<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
This religious mobilization led to a political climate where, as noted by scholars, ‚Äúthe Protestant church gained the ability to influence elections structurally‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Pastors publicly declared the need for Christian political empowerment, with some asserting, ‚ÄúWe must no longer remain passive‚Äîwe must become a political force‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. The Korean Christian Federation (Han Ki Chong), formed around this time, played a significant role in coordinating Protestant political activities and became an institutional platform for subsequent political advocacy.
</p>
<p>
The result of this mobilization was a resounding electoral victory in Busan and Gyeongnam‚ÄîKim‚Äôs strongholds‚Äîwhere he secured over 60% of the vote, propelled by the church‚Äôs organizational strength<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. This alignment of religious infrastructure with electoral strategy not only secured Kim‚Äôs presidency but also ushered in an era of Protestant political ascendancy. As sociologist Jung Tae-sik observes, Kim Young-sam and his evangelical allies ‚Äúacted as a salvation aristocracy, using political means to achieve religious ends and embedding evangelical absolutism within state governance‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Kim Young-sam‚Äôs presidency symbolized the apex of Protestant political influence in modern Korean history. It marked a new phase in church-state relations‚Äîone where ‚Äúmegachurches no longer avoided politics but claimed a rightful place in national leadership‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Through Kim‚Äôs rise, the Protestant church transformed from a religious community into a political actor, institutionalizing its voice within Korea‚Äôs democratic landscape.

<p>
During the 1990s, Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan remained a beacon of moral leadership in South Korea, steering his influence toward reconciliation, economic justice, and interfaith solidarity during a time of national transformation. Following his pivotal role in the democratization movement of the 1980s, Kim continued his public advocacy, grounded in a theology of human dignity and social responsibility.
</p>
<p>
One of the most significant and symbolic acts of the decade occurred during the 1997‚Äì1998 Asian Financial Crisis. In a period marked by widespread economic despair, rising unemployment, and national debt, the South Korean government launched a campaign to collect gold from the public to repay the country‚Äôs $58 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund. Cardinal Kim, then approaching the end of his official tenure as Archbishop of Seoul, donated his gold pectoral cross‚Äîthe sacred item he received during his episcopal ordination‚Äîto this campaign. His act, widely publicized, became a national symbol of solidarity, inspiring many others to contribute personal belongings to help restore the economy<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond economic justice, Cardinal Kim also took bold steps toward inter-Korean reconciliation. In 1995, he established the Committee for the Reconciliation of the Korean People within the Archdiocese of Seoul. This committee launched a weekly ‚ÄúReconciliation Mass‚Äù at Myeongdong Cathedral, where prayers were offered for North Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. These liturgies were accompanied by humanitarian outreach efforts, including food aid and pastoral letters urging Catholics to remember and assist their brethren in the North. His public statements emphasized that true peace could not be achieved by political or military means alone but must begin with the spiritual conversion of hearts and national empathy<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Even as he prepared for retirement, Cardinal Kim remained an active force in shaping public values. In 1998, after serving three decades as Archbishop of Seoul, he became Archbishop Emeritus. Rather than withdrawing from public life, he used his retirement to engage more freely in civic and interreligious initiatives. Notably, he prioritized interreligious dialogue with Buddhist, Protestant, and Confucian leaders. Joint statements and community service projects were launched in partnership with these faith groups, particularly in response to social issues such as poverty, urban alienation, and the moral crisis following rapid modernization<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the decade, Cardinal Kim continued to speak out against injustice. Though South Korea had transitioned to civilian government, many structural injustices remained, including labor exploitation and social inequality. Kim regularly issued pastoral messages and held press conferences denouncing the suppression of union activities and advocating for the humane treatment of workers. His unwavering commitment to human rights earned him continued respect, especially among labor groups, university students, and grassroots movements<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Cardinal Kim‚Äôs influence extended beyond religious boundaries. His funeral in 2009 was attended by national leaders from all faiths and political spectrums, but it was in the 1990s that his public image was firmly established as ‚Äúthe conscience of the nation.‚Äù His ability to combine deep Catholic spirituality with concrete social action made him one of the most revered figures of modern Korea<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.

<p>
Father Ham Se-woong (baptismal name: Augustine) was a leading Catholic priest and one of the most symbolic religious figures in South Korea‚Äôs democratization movement. Throughout the 1990s, even after the end of military rule in 1987, he remained active both inside and outside the Church, emphasizing social justice, reconciliation, and ecclesiastical renewal. His activities in this decade can be understood in four major domains: his continued social movement engagement, his reformist efforts within the Catholic Church, his public speeches and writings, and his overseas and ecumenical solidarity initiatives.
</p>
<p>
In terms of social movements, Father Ham was widely regarded as a moral authority in post-authoritarian civil society. He played a critical role in founding and supporting the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities, which focused on revealing and redressing pro-Japanese collaboration during the colonial period. This involvement was part of a broader effort by civil society actors to restore historical justice and national identity in the wake of democratization. In 1993, he also co-chaired the ‚ÄúCouncil of Religious Leaders for Reconciliation and Peace,‚Äù a coalition of leaders from various religions that worked for inter-Korean reconciliation through civil and religious diplomacy. His participation represented an attempt to broaden the democratic movement into one of national healing and unity across ideological lines.
</p>
<p>
In the late 1990s, Father Ham assumed leadership roles in several civic and political reform coalitions. He became co-chair of the ‚ÄúNational Alliance for Democratic Reform‚Äù in 1998 and the ‚ÄúNational Political Research Association‚Äù in 1999, both of which supported progressive democratic reforms under the Kim Dae-jung administration. Despite the transition to civilian government, he insisted that democratization remained an unfinished task, stating that civic organizations and religious leaders must continue to hold political power accountable and advocate for marginalized groups.
</p>
<p>
Within the Catholic Church, Father Ham remained a reformer committed to the spirit of Vatican II. As a professor at the Catholic University of Korea (1974‚Äì1992), he trained future priests in socially engaged theology. He argued that the Church should be a prophetic voice against structural injustice, not an institution of comfort. In 1996, he helped launch the ‚ÄúGaudium et Spes Pastoral Institute‚Äù to promote theological renewal rooted in liberation theology. He believed that the priesthood was not just a sacramental office but a vocation of solidarity with the poor.
</p>
<p>
In the 1994 controversy over statements by Father Park Hong, then president of Sogang University, who claimed radical leftist groups were infiltrating college campuses, Father Ham publicly condemned such red-baiting rhetoric. He and the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice (CPAJ) denounced the remarks as baseless ideological attacks, and the courts later ruled against Park Hong. This incident clearly illustrated the divide within the Catholic Church between progressives like Father Ham and more conservative clergy.
</p>
<p>
Father Ham also spoke critically of the Church‚Äôs declining role in democratic advocacy during the 1990s. He lamented that the Archdiocese of Seoul and figures like Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan became increasingly cautious, stating that ‚Äúwhen the Church ceases to stand with the suffering, it loses its prophetic calling and risks becoming an opiate.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Through interviews, sermons, and essays, Father Ham maintained a steady public presence. He published numerous books throughout the 1990s, including <em>Jesus Who Came to Set Fire</em>, <em>Jesus Who Brought the Sword</em>, <em>Yoke and Cross: The Church‚Äôs Role in Social Critique</em>, and <em>Why Be a Priest?</em>. These writings provided theological justification for clergy involvement in struggles for justice, arguing that Jesus himself sided with the oppressed.
</p>
<p>
He consistently challenged the National Security Law, calling it an ‚Äúidolatrous law that sows fear and division‚Äù and criticizing those who defended it as guilty of moral blindness.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> His rhetoric, though sometimes controversial, remained grounded in Catholic social teaching and liberation theology.
</p>
<p>
While his main activities remained domestic, Father Ham also engaged in international solidarity efforts. Through his leadership in interfaith councils, he helped facilitate dialogue with Korean diaspora communities and religious groups in Japan and the United States. During the North Korean famine in the mid-1990s, he led fundraising campaigns among Catholic parishes and advocated for humanitarian aid as a moral imperative. He called on religious leaders to prioritize shared humanity over Cold War ideologies.
</p>
<p>
Father Ham often cited Brazilian Archbishop Helder Camara as a major influence. Camara‚Äôs maxim, ‚ÄúWhen I feed the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist,‚Äù shaped Father Ham‚Äôs vision of a prophetic Church that demands both charity and structural change.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In sum, Father Ham Se-woong‚Äôs activities in the 1990s illustrate his enduring commitment to a faith that serves the people. He bridged the gap between street-level activism and theological reflection, becoming a symbol of Korea‚Äôs moral conscience. Even after democratization, he believed the role of clergy was not to retreat but to deepen the Church‚Äôs mission in solidarity with the oppressed. His example inspired a new generation of socially conscious religious leaders who viewed justice as integral to discipleship.

Ha Yong-jo‚Äôs ministry in the 1990s, its significance, and historical context represent a key theological and pastoral development that emerged during a transformative period in the Korean church. He is especially noted for the growth of Onnuri Church, the establishment of a missional church model, and his embodiment of ‚ÄúReformed Life Theology‚Äù. The 1990s marked a period when Korean Protestantism began to decline after decades of rapid growth. Until the 1980s, the church had enjoyed explosive expansion, but criticisms against patriarchal pastoral structures, disillusionment with authoritarian leadership, and broader democratic and globalizing social currents began influencing Korean Christianity. Middle-class believers increasingly desired liber Ibid.ation from rigid, hierarchical church cultures. From 1995 to 2005, the number of Protestant adherents declined by 1.6%, while Catholicism rose by 74.4% and Buddhism by 3.9%<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>. Amid this overall decline, Onnuri Church experienced phenomenal growth.
</p>
<p>
Founded in 1985 by Pastor Ha Yong-jo, Onnuri Church expanded rapidly during the 1990s, establishing a wide range of ministries. He reorganized the traditional church model through small-group-based worship communities, open praise and sermon-centered worship, and the empowerment of lay leadership. Based on a worship experience in England, he envisioned a Spirit-filled church like that in the Acts of the Apostles, recalling that ‚Äúpeople gathered tightly in a small chapel, raised their hands in praise, worship ran over an hour, and the congregation responded with applause and dance. The communion was full of tears and emotion‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>. Such worship enabled deep emotional and spiritual engagement.
</p>
<p>
There were five main reasons why Koreans responded so strongly to Onnuri Church‚Äôs model. First, it responded to the weariness many felt toward patriarchal churches and their longing for alternative communities. Traditional Korean churches were steeped in Confucian authority and development-era authoritarianism. Ha provided ‚Äúreligious alternative spaces‚Äù that allowed believers to subvert oppressive ecclesial norms<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>. Second, it effectively combined cultural sensitivity with mass appeal. Unlike traditional worship, Onnuri‚Äôs format‚Äîwhere people raised hands, clapped, and wept together‚Äîallowed congregants to embody their faith through expressive action. Through John Fiske‚Äôs cultural theory, this phenomenon can be interpreted as believers reappropriating dominant codes to form their own symbolic religious practices<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. Third, it integrated media and educational ministries into everyday life. Onnuri Church launched CGNTV, Duranno Publishing, Onnuri Newspaper, and welfare foundations. The 1995 launch of the Duranno Father School, a program that redefined Christian masculinity and addressed family restoration, was a major success. These were not merely programs, but a lifestyle-centered gospel movement<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>. Fourth, it empowered lay ministry and leadership. Onnuri trained lay leaders to run small groups, teach the Bible, and engage in missions. This shift from passive to active discipleship offered a new participatory model of the church, which contrasted sharply with top-down traditional models. Fifth, it projected a global vision. Guided by the motto ‚ÄúTo the Ends of the Earth,‚Äù Ha Yong-jo planted campuses in Japan, the U.S., and Latin America, implementing a glocalized mission combining media and church planting. This vision appealed especially to younger generations with global identities.
</p>
<p>
Theologically, Ha Yong-jo is seen as a practitioner of Reformed Life Theology, which emphasized not scholastic theology but the lived experience of faith. He declared, ‚ÄúTheology is not an academic discipline. The Word and the Spirit‚Äîthese are the core of theology. Knowing God with the heart and praying on one‚Äôs knees while experiencing the Word‚Äîthat is true theology‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. This theology rejected detached abstraction and sought to unify experiential piety with biblical truth.
</p>
<p>
Ha‚Äôs work in the 1990s did not merely build a megachurch but restructured the entire pastoral and theological landscape of Korean Christianity. His efforts to establish a participatory, culturally relevant, and Spirit-led community laid the groundwork for many missional and megachurch models that followed. His legacy offers a clear direction for Korean church renewal: unity between worship and life, Scripture and culture, theology and spirituality.

Pastor Oak Han-heum‚Äôs ministry during the 1990s, its historical background, and significance can be understood as a decisive expression of pastoral leadership that led both the awakening of the laity and the reform of the church amid the structural crisis and theological confusion that began in the late 1980s in the Korean church. The 1990s marked a period when Korean churches, having reached the peak of quantitative growth, entered a phase of internal crisis marked by spiritual stagnation, authoritarian pastoral leadership, and growing conflicts and divisions within congregations. In this context, Pastor Oak initiated a dual strategy of ‚Äúdiscipleship ministry‚Äù and ‚Äúchurch renewal through preaching,‚Äù offering a turning point for the Korean church.
</p>
<p>
From the founding of Sarang Church in 1978 into the 1990s, Oak Han-heum sought to transition the church‚Äôs center from clergy to laypeople. He resisted the traditional authoritarian structures of church operation and emphasized that every believer was a bearer of apostolic succession, called to proclaim the gospel. He declared that ‚Äúbelievers are all heirs of apostolicity‚Ä¶called to make disciples of all nations,‚Äù thereby positioning the laity not as passive recipients of ministry but as co-laborers in the work of the church<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. This vision deeply resonated with the self-development ethos of Korean society and took root not merely as a strategy for church growth but as a full reformation of the ecclesial structure.
</p>
<p>
This training-centered pastoral philosophy found fertile ground in Korea‚Äôs culture, which values education and diligence. Oak‚Äôs discipleship ministry motivated believers to pursue post-conversion life transformation through disciplined faith. He emphasized that ‚Äúthose saved must live as befits the people of God,‚Äù underlining the necessity of a holy calling as well as righteous identity<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>. While Pastor Ha Yong-jo focused on emotional resonance and relational ministry through culturally open evangelism, Oak emphasized spiritual discipline and responsibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, Sarang Church extended beyond quantitative expansion and began solidifying a missional church model and theological ecclesiology. Oak did not regard the church as merely a place for worship, but as a missionary community called to be salt and light in the world. His discipleship ministry was not a program but a theological strategy to lead believers into holistic obedience to the gospel. He believed that ‚Äúdiscipleship is the link that connects soteriology and ecclesiology,‚Äù and he rooted his ministry in a gospel-driven ecclesiology that positioned discipleship and sending as the very purpose of the church<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
He also pursued the awakening and reformation of the Korean church through preaching. His sermons revolved around the key themes of ‚Äòawakening‚Äô and ‚Äòreform,‚Äô reinterpreting biblical truths in light of contemporary problems facing the church and society. While grounded in Reformed theology, he practiced a theology ‚Äúfor the church,‚Äù not as abstract theory but as pastoral reality. He came to be known as ‚Äúthe preacher who awakened the Korean church‚Äù<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. Above all, he believed that ‚Äúpreaching changes the church,‚Äù and practiced expository preaching as the foundation for nurturing believers. Oak‚Äôs leadership became even more distinctive in the 1990s. Unlike Ha Yong-jo, who cast visions and expanded ministry creatively, Oak was a reformer of ecclesial structures. He reorganized leadership itself by redesigning organizational, personnel, and training systems around verification and discipline. Ha promoted lay participation through small groups and media missions; Ok built lay leadership through rigorous training and qualification. He was not simply a program operator but a ‚Äúpractical reformer‚Äù who staked his ministry on transforming the church‚Äôs essence and structure<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to Ha Yong-jo, whose leadership emphasized freedom and cultural engagement, Oak insisted on training-verified discipleship. His concern was not only the participation of the laity but their transformation. He developed discipleship into a theological framework, not merely a ministry method. Oak ‚Äúpositioned discipleship as the bridge between soteriology and ecclesiology,‚Äù systematizing it into a theological-pastoral model that addressed the very nature of Christian salvation and church life¬≥.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Oak Han-heum‚Äôs work in the 1990s was not just a strategy for church growth but a crucial contribution to the theological, institutional, and spiritual reconstruction of the Korean church. His ministry and preaching continue to be regarded as a ‚Äúpastoral alternative for a church in crisis.‚Äù As a preacher, theologian, trainer, and ecclesial practitioner, he offered a multifaceted leadership and a systematic answer to the question of ‚Äúhow to reform the church.‚Äù As a result, the Korean church could envision transformation not only in outward growth but in becoming a mature and trained community of faith.

<p>
Pastor Jin-Hong Kim, a prominent Presbyterian (Tonghap) minister and social activist, began his ministry in the slums of Cheonggyecheon during the 1970s and carried that spirit into the 1990s. In the wake of South Korea‚Äôs democratization, the 1990s marked a period of ideological transformation and redefinition of public roles for religious institutions. Kim was a key figure in maintaining and reformulating Christian social engagement, particularly by continuing his urban poor and community-centered ministry while also becoming increasingly involved in conservative public discourse and national reform movements.
</p>
<p>
During this decade, Kim continued his community-based ministry at Namyang Bay‚Äôs <em>Dure Village</em>, where he had relocated with evicted Cheonggyecheon residents in 1976. The community featured agricultural cooperatives and Christian communal life rooted in land cultivation and economic self-reliance. He once described the move as ‚Äúa modern-day Exodus,‚Äù portraying himself as a Korean version of Moses<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1996, Kim took part in the civic committee to address issues faced by ethnic Koreans in China, particularly North Korean defectors and the Korean-Chinese diaspora. This initiative signaled the Korean church‚Äôs growing attention to human rights beyond national borders<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>. The following year, in March 1997, Kim moved his ministry from Namyang to Guri, founding what became known as <em>Guri Dure Church</em>. It attracted long-time followers from his previous ministries and rapidly expanded, laying the foundation for what would become one of Korea‚Äôs notable socially active churches<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
During the 1997‚Äì98 Asian Financial Crisis, Kim joined the <em>National Movement for the Second Founding of the Republic</em>, a campaign led by various civic, religious, and political figures aimed at restoring national integrity and morality. As a Christian leader, he emphasized personal sacrifice, economic discipline, and the need for spiritual renewal<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>. This period also marked the publication of several influential books by Kim, including <em>Successful Reform, Failed Reform</em> (1996) and <em>Even If You Fall Next to a Trash Can</em> (1998), in which he blended personal testimony with commentary on Korean society‚Äôs ethical decline<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. His works resonated widely, establishing him as both a spiritual and social voice.
</p>
<p>
While his early career had aligned with progressive Christian activism, by the late 1990s, Kim began articulating more conservative theological and economic views. He famously remarked, ‚ÄúAfter God, money is most important,‚Äù and argued that capitalism was ‚Äúthe child of biblical ethics‚Äù<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. These views sparked both admiration and criticism, particularly from theologians and Christians rooted in minjung theology and liberation traditions<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Reflecting on his past, Kim once said, ‚ÄúI was neither a democrat nor an activist‚ÄîI was just imprisoned by accident,‚Äù distancing himself from the progressive camp<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>. Nonetheless, he also claimed, ‚ÄúI, too, once protested for democratization,‚Äù highlighting the contradictions within his evolving stance<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
His trajectory ultimately laid the foundation for his leadership role in the New Right movement in the early 2000s, but the ideological seeds had already been planted in his 1990s work<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. In this respect, Kim helped redirect Korean Protestant social engagement from progressive anti-authoritarianism toward a morally driven conservatism. His presence in both civic and church circles exemplified the role of clergy as public intellectuals during Korea‚Äôs post-democratic transition.

In the 1990s, Reverend Jo Hwa-soon emerged as one of the most pioneering female pastors and popular movement leaders in South Korea. The church she built was not merely a space for worship‚Äîit became a living site where residents, workers, and women pursued liberation. Beginning her ministry at Dalwol Church in Siheung, her pastoral work was grounded in the belief that ‚Äúthe church is the community,‚Äù a conviction that naturally expanded into broader social movements.
</p>
<p>
To Reverend Jo, the church was not confined to its walls: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe God only dwells inside the church. I think everyone in the local community is a church member.‚Äù<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> She engaged directly in the lives of her neighbors‚Äîattending weddings and funerals even of non-congregants, contributing condolence or congratulatory funds as a sign of solidarity. In Dalhyeon-ri, elderly residents affectionately called her ‚Äúour pastor.‚Äù When she was once arrested, they sang hymns outside the detention center demanding her release.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Within the church, Jo fought to elevate the institutional status of female pastors. As President of the Korean Methodist Church‚Äôs National Association of Women Pastors, she led reforms that allowed married women to continue pastoral ministry, thereby institutionalizing gender equity in church leadership.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> She firmly believed that ‚Äútrue faith is enduring to the end,‚Äù and she maintained that churches must stand with the powerless in society.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beyond the church, she was a symbolic figure in South Korea‚Äôs labor and democratization movements. While working with the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission from 1966, she labored alongside female factory workers in places like Dong-il Textile Company. Through Bible studies, knitting circles, and flower arrangement clubs, she helped raise consciousness and solidarity among women workers. These efforts led to the historic election of a female union leader at Dong-il‚Äîa landmark moment in the history of Korea‚Äôs labor movement.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Yet the journey was fraught with hardship. In 1978, the infamous ‚Äúfeces incident‚Äù occurred, where male workers assaulted female unionists and doused them with excrement. Jo, after delivering public lectures condemning the violence, was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, she stepped into a more institutionalized form of women‚Äôs activism. Serving as the Chair of the Korean Women‚Äôs Associations United, she defined femininity as ‚Äúa warm embrace that comforts others, and the courage to confront injustice.‚Äù<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> Her leadership helped define the direction of Christian feminism and bridged the divide between women‚Äôs rights activism and the progressive church.
</p>
<p>
Her influence extended beyond religious or activist circles. In one notable episode, she proposed organizing a public forum in Siheung, inviting the mayor to engage directly with church members on local issues. ‚ÄúLet the officials come to where the believers are, and let us speak to them about Siheung‚Äôs problems,‚Äù she suggested.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> This event, held within the church, functioned as a model of civic participation and reflected her view that churches should be centers of local democracy.
</p>
<p>
Jo Hwa-soon‚Äôs activities were not merely the passionate work of one pastor. They embodied a lived theology that integrated gospel and justice, women and the people. Her legacy defined a new identity for the Korean clergy‚Äîas public theologian, feminist activist, and community organizer.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>

During the 1990s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-Kyu Park‚Äôs activities reflected a continuation of his lifelong commitment to embodying the social responsibility of the Church and public engagement of Christian faith. As South Korea transitioned into a consolidated democracy, Park channeled his theological convictions into shaping the moral direction of civil society, guiding student and urban poor movements, and seeking regional reconciliation and peace in East Asia. One of the most symbolic events of this decade was his six-year outdoor worship protest in front of the Seoul Jungbu Police Station, held from 1984 to December 1990. After being forcibly ousted from Seoul Jeil Church due to government pressure and internal conflict, Park began worshipping in the street. This act became a powerful expression of ecclesial freedom and resistance. He declared it ‚Äúthe largest church in the world with the sky as its ceiling and no walls,‚Äù making it a living embodiment of the persecuted church<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Even after the military regime gave way to a civilian government, Park warned that the Church must not become complacent. Inspired by Karl Barth‚Äôs imperative to ‚Äúlet the Church be the Church,‚Äù Park remained critical of the Church‚Äôs tendency to side with power or capital. He proclaimed that ‚Äúeven when democracy is institutionalized, the children of light must still rise to resist the forces of darkness‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. He believed the Church must speak prophetically in every age, not merely during dictatorship<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, Park intensified his focus on urban poor ministries and the theological reconfiguration of the minjung (people‚Äôs) movement. Drawing from the ‚ÄúMissio Dei‚Äù (Mission of God) paradigm, he redefined mission as the liberating work of God in the world‚Äînot a function of church expansion or personal salvation alone. He stressed that the true subject of mission is God, and the church is a tool for realizing comprehensive salvation encompassing political, economic, and social liberation<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>. To this end, Park adopted Saul Alinsky‚Äôs community organizing methods and Paulo Freire‚Äôs conscientization strategies to strengthen grassroots urban movements<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. Moreover, Park remained a vital mentor in Christian student movements and the second generation of minjung theology. As honorary advisor of the Korean Christian Student Federation (KSCF), which he had helped establish in 1969, Park encouraged a generation of students to develop a faith-based public vocation. His ‚ÄúGO‚ÄìLOOK‚ÄìACT‚Äù strategy, developed through the Haksa-dan (Student Social Development Group), continued to guide students toward involvement in issues such as labor, reunification, and environmental justice<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>. Park also played a leading role in reconciliation and peace initiatives between Korean and Japanese churches. In the mid-1990s, he facilitated the partnership between Seoul Jeil Church and Nishikatamachi Church in Japan, promoting historical reconciliation and Christian fellowship beyond national boundaries. This model of cross-national church communion offered a theological vision for East Asian peace rooted in repentance, forgiveness, and shared faith<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>.

Throughout the decade, Park emphasized that the 1990s were not merely the fruit of past struggles but a new beginning. ‚ÄúFaith means facing the darkness of our times and opening a new path within it,‚Äù he declared, urging the Church to remain prophetic and engaged. Thus, his work in the 1990s represented not only a continuation of resistance but a reimagining of the Church‚Äôs vocation in a democratizing society.

Ïù¥ÏùÄÏÑ† Un Sunn Lee

<p>
In the 1990s, Lee Un-sun actively advanced a uniquely Korean feminist theology, seeking to reconstruct theological discourse by integrating East Asian intellectual traditions. She criticized the male-centered and individualistic aspects of Christian soteriology and proposed a ‚Äútheology of life-giving spirituality,‚Äù grounded in everyday female embodiment and Confucian self-cultivation. Rather than passively adopting Western feminist theology, she restructured it within the Korean cultural and spiritual context.
</p>
<p>
Drawing on Confucian ideals‚Äîsuch as the <em>Way of the Sage</em> (ËÅñ‰∫∫‰πãÈÅì), <em>sympathetic heart</em> (ÊÉªÈö±‰πãÂøÉ), and the <em>unity of all beings</em> (Ëê¨Áâ©‰∏ÄÈ´î)‚ÄîLee reformulated salvation theology as a threefold structure: <em>Seong</em> (ËÅñ, creativity/transcendence), <em>Seong</em> (ÊÄß, femininity/otherness), and <em>Seong</em> (Ë™†, sincerity/political ethics). This expanded the concept of salvation beyond the soul‚Äôs redemption to a communal vision of transformation, beginning with moral cultivation (<em>‰øÆË∫´</em>) and extending to familial harmony, social reform, and ecological solidarity. For Lee, ‚Äúthe sage, who internalizes transcendence through self-cultivation, is the theological agent in the biosphere era.‚Äù<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
She introduced <em>saengmul</em> (ÁîüÁâ©, living beings) as a concept surpassing <em>saengmyeong</em> (ÁîüÂëΩ, life), to highlight the relational, creative, and nurturing nature of existence. Her definition of sympathy emphasized that ‚Äúsympathy must not end in feeling with, but must lead to doing with,‚Äù stressing action-based solidarity rooted in empathy.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> This concept of sympathy‚Äîcentral to her feminist theology‚Äîwas simultaneously theological and political, emphasizing that divine love is realized through embodied solidarity and communal care. A key articulation of this vision appeared in her 1993 article, <em>‚ÄúOn the Necessity and Meaning of the Encounter between Confucianism and Christianity,‚Äù</em> where she argued that both traditions shared a moral and spiritual foundation that could enrich each other in Korean theological thought. She asserted that Christianity‚Äôs message of agape and Confucianism‚Äôs <em>‰ªÅ (ren)</em> were not contradictory but mutually illuminating. By constructing a theological bridge between the two, she challenged dualistic thinking and asserted a contextual Korean theology of relational salvation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1997, she expanded this vision in her seminal monograph <em>Postmodern Korean Feminist Theology</em>. There, she argued that Korean feminist theology must move beyond Western feminist assumptions‚Äîparticularly their focus on individualism and secularism‚Äîand instead be rooted in the spiritual, ethical, and communal lifeworld of Korean women. She proposed the <em>Seong¬∑Seong¬∑Seong</em> (ËÅñ¬∑ÊÄß¬∑Ë™†) model as a new theological grammar that integrates transcendence, embodied femininity, and public ethics. Salvation, she claimed, is not only liberation from sin but a ‚Äúlife-giving transformation‚Äù of all relationships‚Äîself, household, society, and nature.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1998, Lee applied these theological insights in a more public-facing theological reflection titled <em>‚ÄúShalom‚ÄîSex is No Longer Destiny.‚Äù</em> There, she boldly declared that gender roles are not divine mandates but human constructs shaped by patriarchy. ‚ÄúTo say that sex is no longer destiny,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúis to declare the restoration of human subjectivity and the image of God within every woman.‚Äù<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> She called on the Korean church to renounce gender fatalism and to embrace a vision of <em>shalom</em>‚Äîa peace rooted in justice, equality, and mutual flourishing.
</p>
<p>
Lee‚Äôs feminist theology, shaped in the crucible of Korea‚Äôs Confucian-Christian context, rejected both patriarchal conservatism and uncritical Western imports. Instead, she forged an alternative rooted in embodied spirituality, ecological awareness, and ethical interdependence. Her work was quickly taken up as a foundational framework in the Korean Women‚Äôs Theological Society, where her bridging of Confucianism and Christianity enabled a new wave of indigenous theological reflection.
</p>
<p>
Through these writings, Lee not only challenged the structures of domination embedded in theology but also invited a renewed vision of salvation‚Äîas a communal, ecological, and justice-oriented practice. Her vision of ‚Äúa transformative big bang of salvation beginning with one woman and one household‚Äù became emblematic of Korean feminist theology‚Äôs most profound aspirations.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>

<p>
In the 1990s, Pastor Jae-Chul Lee‚Äôs ministry marked a concrete embodiment of practical theology that challenged prevailing paradigms in the Korean Protestant church. From the outset of his pastoral journey, when he planted <em>The Lord‚Äôs Church</em> in the auditorium of a high school in Songpa, Seoul, in 1988, he set a countercultural tone by declaring a self-imposed 10-year term limit on his pastoral leadership. True to this promise, he stepped down in 1998, stating that a pastor should be ‚Äúnot a wage earner, but a person of calling.‚Äù<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> This act, rare in a church culture dominated by life-long appointments and personal control over congregations, symbolized his theological conviction that authority in the church must be bounded, accountable, and sacrificial.
</p>
<p>
One of Lee‚Äôs most innovative practices was his adoption of <em>expository sequential preaching</em> (ÏàúÏÑúÏÑ§Íµê), in which he preached verse by verse through entire books of the Bible, beginning with the Gospel of John. At a time when most Korean churches favored topical and emotionally driven sermons, this method invited congregants to engage deeply with the structure and flow of Scripture. ‚ÄúEven churchgoers who only attend on Sundays will, over time, understand the Bible more holistically,‚Äù Lee emphasized, noting that such preaching ‚Äúallows God‚Äôs Word to lead both the preacher and the church.‚Äù<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> This method was not merely pedagogical‚Äîit was theological: a commitment to the integrity of Scripture as the foundation of the Christian life.
</p>
<p>
After resigning from The Lord‚Äôs Church, Lee continued to exercise his theological convictions through writing and speaking. In works like <em>Young Man, Sow Even If You Weep</em> (1998) and <em>Discard the Distorted Gospel</em> (2003), he offered a pointed critique of Korean Christianity‚Äôs obsession with prosperity, numerical growth, and institutional power. ‚ÄúThe greatest ailments of the Korean church are materialism, prosperity-seeking, and self-centeredness,‚Äù he wrote, arguing that such distortions ‚Äústand in direct contradiction to the way of Jesus.‚Äù<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> His voice gained moral weight because it was not merely prophetic but lived‚Äîhe had already renounced institutional power and popularity in his own ministry.
</p>
<p>
In 2002, Lee was invited to serve as the senior pastor of the Korean Church Centennial Memorial Church (100th Anniversary Memorial Church), a flagship church within the Korean ecumenical tradition. He served there until 2015, when, in another historic move, he appointed four pastors to succeed him as co-pastors. ‚ÄúA church cannot be healthy unless power is shared,‚Äù Lee declared.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> The decision was both theological and structural, designed to resist the monopolization of authority and encourage communal discernment in church leadership. It was the first time in Korean church history that a megachurch transitioned into a collegial pastoral model without conflict.
</p>
<p>
Through these actions, Lee demonstrated that pastoral ministry must embody theological convictions at every level‚Äîspiritual, ethical, institutional, and relational. In a church culture shaped by hierarchical authority, market-driven expansion, and celebrity leadership, his choices modeled a theology of humility, community, and trust in God‚Äôs Word. Lee‚Äôs ministry in the 1990s thus stands not merely as a critique of the status quo, but as a working proposal for what the church could become when it truly believes that the Kingdom of God is already among us.

Dr.&nbsp;Young-Gil Kim was a South Korean engineer and educator who founded Handong Global University and served as its first president. His life and achievements represent a rare synthesis of technological expertise and a Christian educational philosophy rooted in moral character and global engagement.
</p>
<p>
Born in 1939 in Jiryedong, Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Kim graduated from the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at Seoul National University. He earned a master‚Äôs degree in metallurgical engineering from the University of Missouri and a Ph.D.&nbsp;in materials science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in New York.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> During his years in the United States, he worked as a researcher at NASA‚Äôs Lewis Research Center and the International Nickel Company (INCO), where he contributed to the development of high-temperature alloys for jet engines. In 1979, he returned to South Korea to join the faculty of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) as a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, where he devoted himself to scientific advancement and the training of Korea‚Äôs next generation of engineers.
</p>
<p>
In 1995, Kim established Handong Global University in Pohang, Gyeongbuk, and became its inaugural president.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> The university, from its inception, aimed to be a Christian institution devoted to holistic education and internationalization. Despite numerous initial challenges‚Äîincluding financial hardship and local resistance‚ÄîKim‚Äôs leadership guided the institution to become one of South Korea‚Äôs most innovative universities. Notably, Handong was selected in 2007 as a host university for UNESCO‚Äôs UNITWIN program and designated in 2011 as a global hub of the United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI) initiative.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> Kim envisioned Handong as a space for character formation grounded in Christian values. Students were educated to live with honesty, responsibility, and love, and the school emphasized a strong ethical foundation through programs like the honor system and unproctored conscience exams.
</p>
<p>
Kim worked to embody his Christian faith in his educational philosophy. In 1981, he co-founded the Korea Association for Creation Research and served as its first president. Through Handong, he championed values-based education that fostered not only academic achievement but also compassion and service. He famously promoted the motto, ‚ÄúStudy to give it away,‚Äù encouraging students to become altruistic and mission-oriented leaders.
</p>
<p>
As a scientist, Kim left a remarkable legacy. His research on superalloys for jet engines led to NASA awarding him the Tech Briefs Award in both 1976 and 1981.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> He also received the IR-100 Award for industrial innovation in 1981. After returning to Korea, he led the development of PMC-102, a high-performance alloy for semiconductor lead frames, which became Korea‚Äôs first export of high-tech materials to an advanced industrial nation.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> As an educator and leader, he served in various capacities including president of the Accreditation Board for Engineering Education of Korea (ABEEK), chairman of the Korean Council for University Education, and president of the Korean Association of Private University Presidents, influencing national policy in higher education.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>

Christian Council of Korea (CCK)
<p></p>
<p>
By the late 1980s, the South Korean Protestant community was sharply divided over issues surrounding unification and anti-communist ideology. In 1988, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) issued a declaration titled ‚ÄúA Declaration of the Korean Christian Churches on National Reunification and Peace,‚Äù commonly known as the 88 Declaration. In it, the NCCK confessed and repented that the South Korean church had long regarded anti-communist ideology as a religious tenet and had cursed the North Korean regime and its people. It called instead for peaceful reunification. This declaration caused considerable reverberations both within and outside the Korean church, but it also provoked strong backlash, especially from the broader Protestant community, which at the time leaned heavily conservative. In particular, senior pastors who had fled from North Korea‚Äîsuch as Han Kyung-jik, the elder statesman of Youngnak Church‚Äîfelt a deep sense of crisis in response to the declaration.
</p>
<p>
In January 1989, Han Kyung-jik convened conservative religious elders at the Namhansanseong Retreat Center, where he had retired, and they resolved to establish a new Protestant federation to replace the NCCK. After a series of preparatory meetings and the formation of an organizing committee, the Christian Council of Korea (CCK) was formally launched on December 28, 1989. Although the CCK outwardly advocated church unity and the defense of the gospel, it was fundamentally a conservative reaction to the NCCK‚Äôs progressive theological and political orientations, particularly its overtures to North Korea. The CCK was also committed to preserving anti-communist ideology.
</p>
<p>
Allegations have long persisted that the political establishment‚Äîparticularly the military regime of the time‚Äîwas involved in the CCK‚Äôs founding. Han Myung-soo, the first secretary general of the CCK, later testified in an interview that while he initially dismissed the rumors that the Chun Doo-hwan regime had orchestrated the formation of the CCK to counter the NCCK, he came to believe they were true while serving in office. He cited evidence such as the fact that conservative elders like Han Kyung-jik had supported the military regime and that officials from the Ministry of Culture and Public Information‚Äôs religious affairs office frequently summoned the first CCK chairman, Park Maeng-soo, to give directives. Pastor Oh Choong-il, a member of the National Intelligence Service‚Äôs Truth and Reconciliation Committee, also stated during a 2005 forum that an NIS religious affairs officer had been involved in the CCK‚Äôs formation. These accounts strongly suggest that the CCK was supported‚Äîif not actively created‚Äîby the state to serve as a conduit for politicizing the conservative Protestant bloc.
</p>
<p>
The CCK began its activities with slogans such as ‚Äúdefending biblical evangelical faith,‚Äù ‚Äúchurch unity and cooperation,‚Äù and ‚Äúfulfilling the church‚Äôs social responsibility.‚Äù From the outset, it served as a federation of conservative denominations‚Äîincluding Presbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Pentecostal churches‚Äîand took the lead in developing a united evangelical front. The CCK emphasized the church‚Äôs role in times of national crisis and promoted moral and ethical recovery in Korean society. In doing so, it functioned as a mouthpiece for the conservative church bloc, minimizing internal theological disputes while providing a common voice on major national issues.
</p>
<p>
At the time of its founding, the CCK was composed of 36 denominations. This number steadily increased throughout the 1990s and reached 66 by around 2011, encompassing the vast majority of Korean Protestant denominations. Although it lacked the long institutional history of the NCCK, which was founded in 1924, the CCK soon surpassed the NCCK in terms of membership size and political reach. It emerged as the de facto representative body of Korean Protestantism, often consulted by the political establishment and mainstream media as the voice of the Protestant church.
</p>
<p>
The CCK took clear political stances throughout the 1990s, especially around themes of anti-communism and moral conservatism. In the 1992 presidential election, it openly supported candidate Kim Young-sam, who was also an elder in the Presbyterian Church. This overt endorsement of a political candidate provoked criticism and raised concerns about the church‚Äôs involvement in electoral politics. Nonetheless, the CCK leadership defended its actions as a defense of freedom and democracy, and a stance against communism. After Kim Young-sam assumed office in 1993, the CCK maintained close ties with the ruling party and continued to advocate for the National Security Law, North Korean human rights issues, and national security awareness. As a result, the CCK became an increasingly influential actor in national politics, and in return, the government used it as a channel to communicate with and rally conservative Christian voters.
</p>
<p>
During this period, the CCK also prioritized church ethics and the fight against heresy. Its internal Heresy and Cults Countermeasures Committee worked in cooperation with major denominations to identify and denounce religious groups deemed heretical. The CCK‚Äôs actions in this regard were seen as an attempt to protect doctrinal purity and the public image of Korean Christianity, especially following scandals such as the failed prediction of the rapture by the Dami Mission in 1992. Although these activities were praised by some as necessary safeguards, they also generated criticism about excessive heresy labeling and interdenominational conflicts.
</p>
<p>
Elder statesmen like Han Kyung-jik and denominational leaders such as Park Maeng-soo played a crucial role in founding and leading the CCK. Over the decade, CCK leadership included rotating representatives from major denominations: Jeong Jin-kyung and Lee Sung-taek from the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong), Im Ok from the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap), and Ji Deok from the Baptist Church. By the late 1990s, senior pastors from megachurches began to assume greater influence, such as Lee Man-shin from the Holiness Church and Kil Ja-yeon from the Presbyterian Church in Korea, both of whom later served as CCK presidents. These leaders brought their denominational weight and public recognition to elevate the CCK‚Äôs status. Alongside these formal leaders, prominent evangelical pastors such as Kim Jun-gon (Korea Campus Crusade for Christ), Kim Hong-do (Kumnan Church), Cho Yong-gi (Yoido Full Gospel Church), and Kim Jang-hwan (Baptist Church) contributed significantly, if informally, to shaping the CCK‚Äôs direction. These figures supported the CCK‚Äôs initiatives with revival meetings and public sermons that emphasized anti-communism and conservative theology, further consolidating the evangelical base.
</p>
<p>
The rise of the CCK also formalized the divide between conservative and progressive camps within Korean Protestantism. Whereas the NCCK pursued ecumenical cooperation, dialogue with North Korea, and social justice advocacy, the CCK refused to join global ecumenical bodies like the WCC or the CCA and instead built its own network of conservative churches. The CCK sharply criticized any outreach to the North as ideological betrayal and rejected progressive theological trends. This antagonism exacerbated the polarization within the Korean church.
</p>
<p>
Externally, the CCK faced criticism from civic groups and other religious communities. Its electoral intervention in 1992 was condemned as a violation of church-state separation. Civil society organizations accused it of being a patriarchal, political interest group, and media coverage increasingly highlighted its ties to right-wing politics. In response, the CCK held national prayer breakfasts and revival meetings, emphasizing spiritual awakening and national repentance to legitimize its public role.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the 1990s, the CCK deepened its relationship with conservative political forces. Under President Kim Young-sam, its leaders were invited to advisory committees and national ceremonies. After the 1997 financial crisis, the election of President Kim Dae-jung brought a shift in state ideology. The CCK reacted cautiously to Kim‚Äôs Sunshine Policy, with some members labeling it pro-North. Nevertheless, the organization refrained from direct confrontation, maintaining a watchful stance while quietly voicing concern.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the decade, the CCK had become a key platform for the political mobilization of conservative Christians. Its leaders began to form links with far-right civic organizations, preparing counteractions to anticipated left-leaning governments. This laid the groundwork for the so-called Christian Right in the 2000s, which became active in opposing homosexuality, supporting pro-U.S. policies, and staging nationalist rallies. These developments show that while the CCK maintained institutional decorum during the 1990s, it was already consolidating its political identity.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the CCK‚Äôs status in 1990s Korean society was complex. On one hand, it provided unity for conservative Protestant churches and amplified their collective voice. It helped congregants preserve a coherent religious identity in a time of rapid political transition. However, the CCK also aligned closely with power, abandoned its prophetic role, and became embroiled in scandals and factional disputes. Cases of corruption and power struggles‚Äîespecially over presidential elections within the CCK itself‚Äîeventually eroded its moral legitimacy. Major denominations began to withdraw, and its representational authority in the church community diminished. Still, the historical significance of the CCK in the 1990s cannot be denied. It mobilized the evangelical right and demonstrated both the strength and limits of religious political engagement. Its experience offers a critical case study in the fusion of religion and politics under the banner of anti-communism in modern Korea.
</p>
<p>
National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK)
</p>
<p>
After the democratization of 1987, South Korea entered a transitional period in which military dictatorship came to an end and civil society began to expand autonomously. In this new context, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK), which had long fought for human rights and democratization, ironically began to experience a loss of public influence. Civil society no longer needed the church as a protective platform, and Protestant organizations like the NCCK, which had once incubated the democratic movement, found themselves gradually marginalized by new professional, secular movements with their own resources and networks.
</p>
<p>
Internally, the absence of a common external enemy such as authoritarian rule weakened moral cohesion within the ecumenical movement. Conservative and progressive denominations, which had previously cooperated under tacit agreements, began to clash over direction, leadership appointments, and theological visions. Amid this shifting environment, the 1988 Declaration‚Äîofficially titled The Korean Church‚Äôs Declaration on National Reunification and Peace‚Äîbecame both a milestone and a turning point.
</p>
<p>
The declaration affirmed five principles for peaceful reunification by expanding the 1972 July 4th North-South Joint Statement‚Äôs framework of autonomy, peace, and national unity to include humanitarianism and democratization of the reunification process. It also emphasized the need to sign a peace treaty to replace the armistice, demanded the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea, and called for nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula. This declaration, two years in the making, reflected a comprehensive theological and political agenda grounded in national repentance, human dignity, and peace theology. However, the declaration sparked fierce backlash. Conservative Protestant groups, including the Korean Evangelical Fellowship, Presbyterian elders‚Äô associations, and interdenominational lay organizations, condemned the NCCK for issuing a statement that ‚Äúthreatened national security‚Äù and was ‚Äútantamount to communist collaboration‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Particular controversy arose over the declaration‚Äôs proposals for U.S. troop withdrawal and its affirmation of ‚Äúpeople-centered reunification,‚Äù which many interpreted as aligned with leftist ideology. Even within the NCCK‚Äôs own member denominations, such as the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK, Tonghap), dissenting voices questioned the declaration‚Äôs legitimacy. This tension culminated in the 1989 formation of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK), a conservative ecumenical federation created in direct opposition to the NCCK‚Äôs progressive positions. From its inception, the CCK exceeded the NCCK in size and influence, securing strong financial support from megachurches and cultivating close ties with political elites, especially under the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations. During these years, the NCCK was sidelined from national religious leader meetings, government functions, and state consultations, while the CCK was treated as the legitimate Protestant representative.
</p>
<p>
Within the NCCK, conflicts over leadership selection, denominational representation, and funding only deepened the crisis. The loss of financial support from the World Council of Churches (WCC) forced the NCCK to adopt a more conservative tone to appeal to domestic backers. Attempts to expand lay leadership, partner with regional churches, or create new movements failed to materialize. Meanwhile, the NCCK lost its symbolic status as a safe haven for whistleblowers and protestors, a role it once held during the dictatorship era. Despite these internal and external challenges, the 1988 Declaration remains a landmark in the history of Korean Christianity. It represented the first time that a major Protestant body offered a theologically grounded, politically engaged roadmap for peaceful reunification. Though polarizing, the declaration laid the groundwork for subsequent events such as Rev.&nbsp;Moon Ik-hwan‚Äôs and Lim Su-kyung‚Äôs visits to North Korea and reenergized discussions within the WCC and global Christian networks on Korean peace issues.
</p>
<p>
In short, the 1990s were a period of paradox for the NCCK. On one hand, it suffered from organizational decline, public marginalization, and internal disputes. On the other, it produced a morally ambitious vision that attempted to reorient Korean Protestantism toward justice, repentance, and peacebuilding. This era ultimately forced the NCCK to reexamine its identity and mission within a democratized, pluralistic society.
</p>
<p>
Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development (CISJD)
</p>
<p>
The Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development (hereafter CISJD), established in 1979 based on ecumenical principles, pursued the vision of building a ‚Äújust and democratic society‚Äù and a ‚Äúcommunity of coexistence.‚Äù During the 1990s, Korean churches continued to wrestle with major issues such as democratization, social justice, and reunification. In this context, CISJD played a prominent role, particularly in the fields of labor, human rights, church reform, and reunification. For example, a 1988 report published by CISJD titled The Presidential Election Struggle: The Logic and Practice of the People‚Äôs Democratic Movement revealed the organization‚Äôs strong support for democratization and labor movements. This shows that CISJD aligned itself with the struggles of workers and the oppressed and was committed to expanding their rights in society. At the time, issues such as securing the right to organize, opposing privatization, and protecting freedom of expression were central, and CISJD actively responded to these concerns both inside and outside the church.
</p>
<p>
CISJD supported labor rights throughout the 1990s. It maintained solidarity with newly emerging labor unions after democratization, advocating for the elimination of irregular labor and the freedom to organize. The organization‚Äôs focus on the rights of the working poor and the promotion of democracy within the workplace highlights its commitment to Christian social ethics. Though detailed media coverage from the time is limited, the institute‚Äôs position was clearly aligned with broader progressive Christian engagement in labor issues.
</p>
<p>
The 1990s marked a period of expanding civil liberties in Korea. CISJD, whose founding vision was rooted in justice and democracy, was naturally active in supporting causes such as freedom of conscience and freedom of speech. In particular, the organization sided with the progressive factions within the Korean church that supported liberation theology and criticized lingering authoritarianism. While specific declarations from the 1990s are scarce, it is evident that CISJD advocated for civic engagement and human dignity in both public and church discourse.
</p>
<p>
One of the institute‚Äôs core commitments was church reform. As the Korean church grew in size and wealth, problems of corruption, materialism, and clerical authoritarianism became more prominent. In response, CISJD called for a return to ‚Äúanti-mammonist faith‚Äù and emphasized the mission of the church in terms of service and public responsibility. It promoted internal democratization of church structures, the inclusion of young people and women in leadership, and critical reflection on theology and ecclesiology. These reformist impulses continued into the 21st century‚Äîfor example, CISJD hosted academic forums on topics such as ‚ÄúKorean Churches and the Youth.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
CISJD also played a part in peace and reunification movements. From its inception, the institute had emphasized peaceful coexistence and dialogue, and in the 1990s it supported inter-Korean exchange and nuclear disarmament. In later years, it published policy reports such as ‚ÄúHow to Resume the Peace Process on the Korean Peninsula.‚Äù¬π This continuing interest reflects the Korean church‚Äôs long-standing concern with peacemaking and overcoming Cold War divisions. The institute also collaborated with NGOs working on reunification and humanitarian aid to North Korea.
</p>
<p>
Beyond these thematic areas, CISJD engaged in wide-ranging solidarity work on issues such as women‚Äôs rights, the environment, and the urban poor. Notably, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (Korean Council, formerly) used part of CISJD‚Äôs office in Seoul in the late 1990s, showing the institute‚Äôs support for feminist and anti-colonial advocacy.
</p>
<p>
These activities were highly significant within the context of the 1990s Korean church. While conservative, charismatic, and prosperity-driven churches gained momentum, progressive Protestant voices like CISJD provided a critical counterbalance. The institute played a bridge role between church and society, advocating justice-based theology rooted in minjung and liberation theology. It helped sustain a prophetic tradition within Korean Christianity by encouraging public engagement, theological reflection, and ethical responsibility.
</p>
<p>
Christian Ethics Movement for Practice (CEM)
</p>
<p>
The Christian Ethics Movement for Practice (CEM) was founded in 1987, during a transitional moment in South Korea‚Äôs democratization, when society was seeking a new moral compass and ethical framework. Throughout the 1990s, the organization carried out a broad range of reform initiatives grounded in evangelical faith, addressing not only personal piety but also contributing structurally to the improvement of ethical consciousness and civic responsibility in Korean society.
</p>
<p>
CEM‚Äôs emergence coincided with the democratizing energy following the June 1987 Uprising and the July‚ÄìAugust labor movement. At a time when the radical theology of the minjung movement and the institutional church both struggled to adapt, CEM provided a third way‚Äîa model of ‚Äúsocial reform through personal ethical renewal.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
As a Christian civic organization, it extended evangelical ethics into the public sphere and chose institutional reform and lifestyle-based movements over political radicalism. One of the most significant actions during the 1990s was the Clean Elections Movement. In the 1991 local elections, CEM organized the ‚ÄúChristian Committee for Clean Elections‚Äù to resist electoral corruption and pastoral interference in politics. This initiative promoted a set of ethical criteria for political engagement, working in collaboration with groups such as the Citizens‚Äô Coalition for Economic Justice (CCEJ) and the YMCA. Its impact continued through subsequent elections in 2000 and 2004, contributing to broader coalitions like the ‚ÄúCivic Movement Council for Clean Elections‚Äù. Another major effort was the Healthy Church Movement, which targeted internal corruption within churches, especially the practice of hereditary pastoral succession. In the late 1990s, CEM issued public statements opposing this custom and petitioned denominations for reform. Although this created tensions with some conservative denominations, it played a pivotal role in embedding the logic of self-regulation within Korean Protestantism. CEM also spearheaded the Cultural Consumer Movement, aimed at reforming unethical media content. It launched the ‚ÄúRight Media Reading Campaign‚Äù to criticize sensationalism in sports tabloids and promote media ethics. By organizing petitions and advertising boycotts, it applied civic pressure that led to concrete changes in broadcasting regulations. However, its activism sparked both alliances with certain public agencies and conflict with liberal civic groups who saw it as moralistic or censorious.
</p>
<p>
These campaigns were underpinned by a theological commitment to evangelical public witness. Professor Son Bong-ho, a founding leader, argued that ‚Äúif Christians fail to set a moral example, they have no authority to criticize social corruption.‚Äù He emphasized the necessity of personal integrity as the basis for credible public ethics. CEM‚Äôs intellectual foundation rested on evangelical covenantal ethics, shaped in part by the Lausanne Covenant, which asserted that ‚Äúwe must participate in God‚Äôs concern to liberate people from every kind of oppression‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
CEM established a distinct voice within Korean society, achieving moral authority across both religious and secular spaces. It collaborated with civic organizations like YMCA, CCEJ, and media watchdogs, while maintaining critical distance from more radical groups. Especially in economic justice campaigns, it rejected class-based narratives, advocating instead for moral responsibility and incremental reform. This exposed it to criticisms from both progressive and conservative quarters‚Äîseen by some as ‚Äúlimited moralism‚Äù and by others as ‚Äúunnecessary political engagement‚Äù. Nevertheless, CEM made a lasting impact in four key areas: (1) initiating ethical reform within Protestant churches, (2) modeling evangelical civic engagement, (3) reviving ethical discourse across multiple sectors, and (4) serving as a bridge between faith communities and secular civil society. In this way, CEM opened a new path for evangelical Christianity in post-democratization Korea. Without resorting to militant politics or ideological dogmatism, it demonstrated the possibility of ‚Äúcritical distance and constructive reform‚Äù through ethical practices rooted in faith.

<p>
Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR)
</p>
<p>
During the 1990s, the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) actively expanded its organizational structure and public outreach. Originally founded in 1981 by Dr.&nbsp;Kim Young-gil of KAIST, the association was officially incorporated as a legal non-profit organization in November 1990 by the Ministry of Education, laying a firm institutional foundation for its work. Regional branches steadily increased; starting with Daejeon and Daegu in 1981, the organization had more than 10 branches nationwide by the late 1990s.
</p>
<p>
The KACR held annual lectures and symposiums on creation science. In celebration of its 10th anniversary, the association hosted a large-scale international symposium at Onnuri Church in August 1991, featuring six speakers from countries including the U.S., Australia, and Japan, and drawing approximately 4,000 attendees.Another international symposium followed in 1993, held during the Daejeon Expo, with five Korean and six foreign scientists participating. In addition to such major events, the association organized smaller public debates and seminars across churches and universities. The KACR also developed a variety of publications, including the periodical Creation and textbooks aligned with its scientific creationist perspective. In 1990, the association published Natural Science, a university-level science textbook written by 27 members, attracting attention from both church and academic communities. Other publications included introductory books such as What You Didn‚Äôt Know About Creation Science, as well as evangelistic pamphlets and visual materials.
</p>
<p>
In 1993, the KACR opened a creation science exhibition hall during the Daejeon Expo. The hall, comprising seven themed sections‚Äîsuch as Genesis creation, Noah‚Äôs Flood, geology, and fossils‚Äîattracted around 60,000 visitors during the Expo‚Äôs three-month run. The association also developed university courses at Christian institutions like Myongji University and Handong Global University, and in 1995, launched the ‚ÄúCreation Science Supporters Fellowship,‚Äù composed of pastors and laypeople who actively supported church-based creation science education. Despite these initiatives, attempts to integrate creationist content into public school science curricula met resistance. Efforts to include creationism in textbooks failed, and the KACR even pursued constitutional litigation challenging the exclusion.
</p>
<p>
The KACR is rooted in the evangelical and fundamentalist Christian tradition. Interest in creation science intensified after the 1980 World Evangelization Crusade held in Seoul, where a seminar titled ‚ÄúCreation or Evolution?‚Äù featured American speakers like Henry Morris and Duane Gish. This event sparked momentum for the association‚Äôs official launch the following year. Theologically, the KACR adhered to biblical inerrancy and a literal interpretation of Genesis, including young-earth creationism. It sought to present creationism in the guise of scientific inquiry, collaborating with fundamentalist institutions like the U.S.-based Institute for Creation Research (ICR). Churches from both conservative and some moderate Protestant denominations provided financial support. In 1994, Pastor Hong Nam-yi of Daejeon‚Äôs Chanyang Church and other clergy formed a creation science pastoral support group, which developed into a larger fellowship the following year. This movement was widely seen in the Christian community as a defense of biblical worldview and a faith-based educational ministry.
</p>
<p>
The KACR‚Äôs efforts to challenge evolutionary theory sparked significant tension in academic and educational circles. Mainstream scientists regarded creation science as lacking empirical rigor. In 1982, at a symposium organized by the Inha University Natural Science Research Institute, only evolutionist scholars presented because the creationist speakers declined the invitation. Philosophers of science like Jang Dae-ik and Ko Myung-jin classified creation science as ‚Äúpseudoscience‚Äù due to its lack of falsifiability.
</p>
<p>
Education policy also became a battleground. The KACR opposed the exclusive teaching of evolution in secondary school textbooks and asserted that doing so violated religious freedom. They even prepared a constitutional appeal. This tension continued into the 2000s as curriculum review guidelines became a subject of dispute. While some churches pushed for curriculum changes, science educators and teachers‚Äô groups criticized the KACR‚Äôs efforts as unscientific and ideologically driven. In 1991, the science magazine Science Dong-A featured a three-part dialogue between creationist and evolutionist scholars, underscoring the controversy‚Äôs depth.
</p>
<p>
The KACR‚Äôs work occupied a contentious space between Christian and scientific communities. Coverage by mainstream media varied: conservative outlets like Kukmin Ilbo reported on the constitutional appeal from a sympathetic angle, while progressive outlets like Hankyoreh or Kyunghyang Shinmun tended to be critical. Hankyoreh Science Webzine published retrospective essays comparing the creation-evolution debate in Korea to the 1925 Scopes ‚ÄúMonkey‚Äù Trial in the United States. Christian media and broadcasters portrayed the KACR more favorably, highlighting its conferences, publications, and exhibits as efforts to demonstrate the compatibility of faith and science. Public outreach was relatively effective: the 1993 Expo exhibit drew tens of thousands, and creation science lectures became a common feature of youth ministries in larger churches.
</p>
<p>
Assessments of the creation science movement vary widely. Supporters view the KACR‚Äôs work as a vital campaign to defend religious freedom and biblical worldview. The association argued that exclusive teaching of evolution infringed upon believers‚Äô rights and religious pluralism. Parents and pastors praised its potential to provide Christian youth with a faith-compatible view of science. Socially, it raised broader questions about religious freedom, scientific authority, and educational diversity. Critics, however, argued that creation science lacked scientific rigor and undermined quality science education. Professor Kim Woo-jae was sued for defamation by the KACR after labeling the group as ‚Äúpseudoscientific,‚Äù but the charges were dismissed. Philosophers like Jang Dae-ik applied the standards of Popperian falsifiability and Kuhnian paradigms to argue that creation science was unscientific by definition. They warned that the movement promoted anti-intellectualism and could erode the integrity of science education.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the Korea Association for Creation Research played a pivotal role in introducing the creation-evolution debate to Korean society in the 1990s. The movement mobilized the conservative Christian base to engage in education and science discourse while sparking societal reflection on the boundaries between science and religion. From a neutral perspective, the KACR significantly influenced faith-based education in Korea but remained deeply controversial in terms of scientific legitimacy.
</p>
<p>
Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF)
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF) sought to overcome internal fragmentation and respond to a rapidly changing social landscape by reorienting itself as a democratic, grassroots movement. This decade marked a turning point as KSCF attempted to recover from the ideological conflicts and organizational crises that had plagued it since the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
One of the most significant crises emerged in 1989 during the appointment of a new general secretary, which revealed deep internal divisions. This incident, though initially seen as a personnel issue, reflected broader, long-standing tensions over the relationship between ‚Äúfaith and politics‚Äù and ‚Äúgospel and society.‚Äù As one source notes, ‚Äúthe appointment controversy dealt a critical blow to the credibility of the organization, exhausting its moral and activist energy, and leading to distrust among students‚Äù. This triggered a serious internal reckoning about KSCF‚Äôs democratic structure and mission. In response, the 1991 General Assembly declared a plan of ‚Äúreunification,‚Äù outlining strategic priorities such as the consolidation of ideological direction, the reinforcement of local chapters, and the democratization of organizational processes. These measures signaled a transition from a narrowly focused movement to a broader people-centered activism. The federation also worked to restore relationships with denominational churches and expand its national support base.
</p>
<p>
Among KSCF‚Äôs flagship initiatives in the 1990s was the ‚ÄúSuffering and Resurrection Campaign,‚Äù which built on the legacy of earlier movements like the April Revolution commemorations of the 1970s and 1980s. In this framework, KSCF aligned itself with contemporary struggles for justice. In 1993, students organized a nationwide fundraising campaign for former ‚Äúcomfort women‚Äù; in 1994, they mobilized around the issues of prisoner amnesty and the abolition of the National Security Law; and in 1995, they led campus-wide solidarity campaigns with foreign laborers.
</p>
<p>
Rural mission work was also restructured in light of new realities. Student groups no longer relied on top-down programs but instead designed context-sensitive summer ministries through grassroots planning. These efforts emphasized community-based faith practices that embodied social solidarity. Additionally, KSCF did not limit its work to activism but fostered theological reflection and research. Through publications such as Bible and Praxis, the federation explored a biblically grounded theology of liberation and promoted socially engaged Christian thought. This was part of an effort ‚Äúto root the student movement not only in activism but in a theological tradition responsive to Korean society‚Äôs ethical and spiritual crises‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1990s were a decade of redefinition for the KSCF. Despite internal and external challenges, it remained a space where faith intersected with democracy, justice, and intellectual inquiry. Its trajectory during this time demonstrated how Christian student movements could serve as laboratories for integrating gospel witness with public ethics in a transforming Korean society.
</p>
<p>
YWCA
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, the Korean YWCA entered a significant period of transition marked by institutional expansion and a deepening reflection on its identity as a Christian women‚Äôs movement. Following decades of cautious engagement during authoritarian rule, the organization began to ask itself fundamental questions about its social mission‚Äî‚ÄúWhat is the YWCA and what should it become?‚Äù‚Äîas it responded to the democratization and decentralization movements unfolding across South Korea. This decade witnessed a strategic tension between institutionalization and prophetic action, as the YWCA assumed new roles in public service delivery while also trying to remain faithful to its mission of Christian-inspired social justice and women‚Äôs empowerment.
</p>
<p>
One major development during this time was the YWCA‚Äôs growing participation in the state-led privatization of welfare services. Beginning in the early 1990s, local YWCA branches across the country received contracts from the government to operate child care centers, women‚Äôs job training institutes, counseling services, and shelters. By 1995, the number of local YWCA social workers had grown from 93 in 1981 to nearly 1,500, signaling a rapid quantitative expansion. However, this growth also raised internal concerns. The shift toward welfare provision risked diffusing the YWCA‚Äôs core movement identity, as staff became increasingly absorbed in facility management rather than grassroots advocacy.
</p>
<p>
This institutional turn was not merely bureaucratic; it was also animated by regional innovation and experimentation. In Gwangju, the YWCA served as a vital hub of social resistance and citizen education well into the 1990s. Programs such as the Citizen Forums, Thursday Prayer Meetings, and the People‚Äôs Forum (Minjung Nondan) brought together leading theologians, dissident intellectuals, and church-based activists. Figures such as Moon Ik-hwan, Han Wan-sang, and Suh Nam-dong delivered public lectures at Gwangju YWCA, directly challenging the legacy of military rule and cultivating a new public ethos of peace, human rights, and social participation. In addition, the YWCA hosted alternative education initiatives like Winter College, where dismissed professors from the ‚ÄúEducation Guidelines Incident‚Äù (1990) gave lectures to students and citizens alike. These programs positioned Gwangju YWCA as a ‚Äúpublic salon‚Äù and spiritual base for democratic civic culture in the region.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Daegu YWCA maintained a sustained focus on social service and civic education, even within the constraints of a politically conservative region. Throughout the 1990s, Daegu YWCA emphasized gendered community care and women‚Äôs empowerment through programs aimed at job training, youth education, and environmental activism. Interviews with local activists reveal that many were inspired by their earlier involvement in student and democratization movements, and they carried this vision into their YWCA work. Although the YWCA in Daegu did not pursue overt political activism like some other civic groups, it cultivated social change through what might be termed a ‚Äúquiet pedagogy of citizenship,‚Äù rooted in Christian values and persistent local engagement.
</p>
<p>
A key sector of transformation for YWCA in this period was care work, as the organization restructured its employment support programs in response to shifts in labor and welfare policy. Originally operating under a free job referral model, YWCA began transitioning to social enterprises, cooperatives, and fee-based placement services to secure sustainability. The YWCA resisted the market logic that dominated care services, instead proposing an alternative model grounded in communal responsibility, women‚Äôs rights, and the public good. This approach was dubbed the ‚ÄúCare Justice Movement,‚Äù and aimed not only at delivering quality services but also at reforming social perceptions of domestic labor and improving working conditions for female care workers.
</p>
<p>
YWCA‚Äôs care-related projects were characterized by several distinctive features. First, they were rooted in a member-based community ethos, allowing for mutual support between the organization and care workers. Second, the organization had a rich history of training and credentialing, ensuring professionalism. Third, its Christian and feminist mission gave workers a sense of pride and ethical responsibility. Fourth, it maintained a strong national-local network capable of responding to diverse needs. Finally, its longstanding partnership‚Äîsometimes critical‚Äîwith government agencies enabled it to shape welfare policy while retaining its independent moral vision.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1990s Korean YWCA embodied a multifaceted identity: a care service provider, a Christian reform movement, and a civic educator. While it expanded into the formal welfare apparatus, it also maintained a critical and creative presence in local communities. By integrating faith, gender justice, and public service, YWCA redefined what a women‚Äôs organization could look like in post-authoritarian South Korea‚Äîneither narrowly religious nor simply secular, neither merely charitable nor overtly confrontational. Rather, it stood as a mediating space where ordinary women could participate in the remaking of Korean civil society.

Global Mission Movement
<p></p>
<p>
The cross-cultural missionary movement of the Korean church began in earnest in 1912, when the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea resolved to send missionaries to Shandong Province in China. This decision marked a clear departure from earlier efforts aimed at ministering to Korean diaspora communities or remote domestic regions. Prior to this, most missionary activity had targeted culturally homogeneous groups. For example, in 1907, Rev.&nbsp;Lee Ki-Poong was dispatched to Jeju Island following the formation of the Korean Presbytery, a move motivated by the desire to evangelize an unreached area within Korea. Similarly, Choi Kwan-Hol was sent to Vladivostok in 1909, and Han Seok-Jin to Japan, both to minister to Korean immigrants residing there. However, the missionaries sent to China in 1913‚ÄîPark Tae-Ro, Kim Young-Hoon, and Sa Byung-Soon‚Äîwere trained to preach in Chinese and were tasked with evangelizing to Chinese nationals. Han-Sung Kim identifies them as the first genuinely cross-cultural missionaries in Korean church history: ‚ÄúThe missionaries dispatched in 1912 were the first Korean missionaries with the calling to evangelize Chinese people in their language‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
This decision, radical for its time, marked a critical transformation of the Korean church from a passive recipient of Western missionary efforts to an active participant in global mission. This took place just 30 years after Suh Sang-Ryun was baptized by John Ross in Manchuria in 1883 and returned to Korea to share the gospel, and less than 30 years after the arrival of Horace G. Underwood and Henry G. Appenzeller in 1885. Despite the brief history of Protestantism in Korea, the church demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to cross-cultural missions. This period, lasting from 1912 to 1955, is thus classified as the formative or preparatory phase of Korean cross-cultural missions. Even during national crises such as Japanese colonial rule (1910‚Äì1945) and the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953), the flame of Korean missions was never fully extinguished.
</p>
<p>
Following the devastation of the Korean War, the Korean church rekindled its missionary zeal. In 1955, Rev.&nbsp;Choi Chan-Young became the first missionary dispatched after the war, sent to the Philippines. He left behind a war-torn homeland to devote himself to gospel ministry and church planting in Manila. While the number of missionaries remained small throughout the 1950s to the late 1970s, churches and missionary organizations gradually began to develop sending structures and training programs. Han-Sung Kim refers to this period as the ‚Äúpioneering phase‚Äù and notes that it ‚Äúis summarized as the mission work of a small number of missionaries focused on Asia‚Äù. These early missionary efforts largely targeted nearby regions such as Southeast Asia, Japan, and Taiwan, and were still lacking in strategic maturity and field experience.
</p>
<p>
A clear leap forward began to take shape in the late 1970s. A pivotal turning point was the 1973 Billy Graham Crusade held at Yeouido Plaza in Seoul, where over one million people gathered. Graham emphasized repentance and the urgency of evangelism, embedding within Koreans the dual vision of national and global evangelization. Jang Yun Cho describes this moment as follows: ‚ÄúThe Billy Graham evangelistic crusade held in Seoul, Korea, in 1973, pulled the trigger for both the modern Korean missions movement and the evangelical movement‚Äù. In 1974, the Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (KCCC) hosted EXPLO ‚Äô74, a mass evangelistic conference that drew a record-setting 2.7 million people in a single gathering‚Äîthen the largest in Christian history. This event inspired thousands of young Koreans to embrace a vision for world missions. Cho notes, ‚ÄúThese two mass evangelistic conferences made a great impact on Korean believers for both national evangelization and world missions‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Following these events, Korean mission agencies either emerged or significantly strengthened their infrastructure. Organizations such as the Global Missionary Fellowship (GMF), Global Mission Pioneers (GMP), Global Bible Translators (GBT), Korean Presbyterian Mission (KPM), and Helping Overseas Professional‚Äôs Employment (HOPE) developed during this preparatory phase for the global expansion of Korean missions. Notably, evangelical campus ministries like CCC, UBF, and IVF began forming pipelines for missionary recruitment, laying the groundwork for the Mission Korea movement that would formally launch in 1988.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the period from 1955 to 1989 represents a transitional phase, from small-scale, hardship-driven efforts to a more structured and expansive leap forward. The Korean church came to see missions not just as a noble calling, but as a necessary outcome of church revival and growth‚Äîa conviction that formed the foundation for its emerging identity as a sending church.
</p>
<p>
The overseas missions movement of the Korean church in the 1990s must be understood as the culmination of a series of theological, historical, and institutional developments that began decades earlier. Its roots can be traced to 1912, when the Korean Presbyterian Church, commemorating the establishment of its General Assembly, decided to send its first cross-cultural missionaries to Shandong, China. Unlike earlier missionaries such as Yi Ki-pung (Jeju Island, 1907), Choi Gwan-hol (Vladivostok, 1909), and Han Seok-jin (Japan, 1909), who served within the Korean diaspora, the 1913 missionaries were charged with the unprecedented task of evangelizing Chinese people in their own language and cultural setting. This decision came barely thirty years after Protestant Christianity first entered Korea, and it marked the beginning of Korea‚Äôs cross-cultural missions history, revealing a remarkable ecclesial boldness for such a young church. As Kim Hansung notes, ‚ÄúAlthough Korean Protestantism had only just begun to take root, it launched a full-scale foreign missions effort‚Äîa movement unparalleled among non-Western churches of the time‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
In the decades that followed, Korea‚Äôs missionary movement remained modest in scale. However, the post-Korean War years saw the emergence of a new missionary consciousness. The 1950s to 1970s, often labeled the ‚Äúpioneering phase,‚Äù were characterized by the sending of small numbers of missionaries, mostly within Asia. The missionary count remained limited: by 1972, Korean churches had dispatched only 33 missionaries abroad. But things began to change dramatically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The turning point, many agree, was the 1973 Billy Graham Crusade in Seoul, which mobilized mass audiences and reinvigorated the evangelical impulse in Korean Christianity. According to Cho Jang Yun, this crusade, followed by the 1974 Explo ‚Äô74 organized by Korea Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC), ‚Äútriggered not only a national revival movement but also a new missionary vision among evangelical Christians‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
It was during this period that the foundational ideas and structures of the modern Korean missions movement were laid. By 1986, the number of missionaries had risen to 511, although 75% were still ministering primarily to Korean populations abroad. The movement was still in a preparatory phase‚Äîwhat Cho calls a ‚Äúteenage stage‚Äù. The real explosion came in the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
One of the most decisive events in launching this explosion was the founding of Mission Korea in 1988. Mission Korea was a nationwide interdenominational missions conference that brought together a wide coalition of student ministries, including IVF, CCC, UBF, YWAM Korea, JOY, and others. Held biennially, the first Mission Korea conference marked a symbolic and organizational milestone in Korean missions. The 1990 conference was particularly pivotal. As Cho recounts from personal experience, ‚ÄúOn the final night, during George Verwer‚Äôs challenge for overseas missions, over 2,000 students stood up to dedicate their lives to mission work. I was among them‚Äù. This moment captures how Mission Korea served as the Korean version of the Student Volunteer Movement‚Äîa movement that deeply inspired early American missionaries to Korea. The Korean slogan ‚ÄúWorld Evangelization in Our Generation‚Äù was consciously modeled after that of the SVM.
</p>
<p>
Statistically, the growth in missionary numbers during the 1990s was unprecedented. In 1994, there were 3,272 Korean missionaries serving in various countries. By 1996, that number had risen to 4,202. In 1998, it reached 5,948. This meant that in just one-decade, Korean overseas missions had more than doubled, positioning Korea as the world‚Äôs second-largest missionary-sending country after the United States.
</p>
<p>
This explosion was the product of several converging factors. The first was church growth. The 1980s had seen Korean Protestantism surpass ten million adherents. Churches had not only grown in number and size, but in financial capacity and strategic vision. ‚ÄúMission,‚Äù in many congregations, came to be seen as the natural sequel to revival. As Cho observes, ‚ÄúThere was a communal imagination that the fruit of revival must be missions‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Second, Korea‚Äôs economic development provided the material base for mission expansion. The post-Olympics boom and the rise of a stable middle class allowed churches and individuals to support long-term missionaries. Self-funded or bi-vocational missionaries became common, and local churches increasingly took on the financial and logistical burdens of sending and supporting missionaries.
</p>
<p>
Third, the missionary movement became a popularized movement‚Äîa movement of the whole church. It was no longer limited to pastors or elites. Evangelical theology emphasized that every believer was a missionary, and this belief translated into concrete mobilization: conferences, youth camps, church seminars, and family mission trips became regular features of church life throughout the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
Korean missionary efforts also matured theologically and strategically during this period. Theologically, the movement was grounded in a robust evangelical framework. The authority of Scripture, the uniqueness of Christ, and the universality of the Great Commission formed the non-negotiable core. But this foundation also gave rise to new theological emphases, including the missio Dei, incarnational mission, and contextualization. Cho notes that, ‚ÄúKorean missions theology developed from a simple proclamation model to one that includes cultural understanding, social engagement, and cross-cultural discipleship‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Strategically, the movement diversified its methods. The 10/40 Window became a widely adopted framework, drawing attention to the vast, unreached populations in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Korean missionaries began entering ‚Äúcreative access‚Äù nations, often under the guise of professionals‚Äîteachers, engineers, doctors, and nurses‚Äîwho could work and witness without official missionary visas. The business-as-mission (BAM) model also gained traction, as Korean entrepreneurs used their businesses to gain access to closed countries and create platforms for evangelism and discipleship.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the structure of missionary sending also diversified. Denominational mission boards, such as those of the Hapdong, Tonghap, and Koshin Presbyterian Churches, played a central role in long-term pastoral training and traditional church planting missions. But interdenominational agencies like GMP (Global Mission Pioneers), GMF (Global Missionary Fellowship), and GBT (Global Bible Translators) provided a flexible, lay-oriented path for teachers, women, and non-clergy to enter the field. Additionally, megachurches such as Yoido Full Gospel Church and Onnuri Church began to form their own in-house mission departments, bypassing both denominational and parachurch structures. These churches offered comprehensive systems of missionary training, funding, field support, and accountability. This ‚Äúchurch-based mission‚Äù model allowed for a more agile and contextually responsive approach to global missions.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the 1990s, the Korean church had fully transitioned from being a mission field to becoming a mission force. The missionary movement had become embedded not only in institutional structures, but in the spiritual imagination of the Korean evangelical public. As Cho concludes, ‚ÄúThis movement has changed the agenda and atmosphere of the Korean church. It has had a great impact on the lives of Christians and on Korean society‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
North Korean Mission Movement
</p>
<p>
The surge of North Korean mission efforts in the 1990s was a comprehensive missionary movement, catalyzed by the collapse of the Cold War system and the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation. Korean churches and missionary organizations astutely responded to changes in international politics and internal North Korean dynamics by launching diverse missionary strategies, and in this process, various specific events played crucial roles in materializing the missionary boom.
</p>
<p>
First, the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement was signed in 1991, and in the same year, a symposium was held in Los Angeles involving scholars from North and South Korean churches. In July, the Peaceful Unification Mission Christian Conference convened in Tokyo, Japan, and in October, the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace (ACRP) was held in Kathmandu, Nepal, thereby formally beginning religious exchanges between North and South. These international encounters did not merely symbolize reconciliation but decisively propelled the Korean church to embrace North Korean mission as a tangible task.
</p>
<p>
Another pivotal moment occurred with the North Korean famine (Arduous March) and the subsequent international emergency food aid request in 1995. North Korea officially acknowledged its food crisis in February 1995 and requested 300,000 tons of aid from international NGOs, later extending urgent requests to South Korea and Japan in May of the same year. As a result, Korean churches and Christian NGOs, both conservative and progressive, launched large-scale humanitarian assistance, promoting a new form of mission that combined ‚Äúgospel and bread.‚Äù Heo Seong-eop noted that ‚ÄúNorth Korean missions shifted toward a stage where humanitarian relief and gospel evangelism were integrated as dual strategies.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
During this period, churches and missionary organizations actively diversified their methods for North Korean missions. A particularly notable development was the diversification of missionary strategies and the institutionalization of the identity of ‚ÄòNorth Korean missionary.‚Äô Notably, the Korean Christian Federation‚Äôs Unification Mission College established a specialized program for training North Korean missionaries from the mid-1990s. This program was open to youths, university students, seminarians, laypeople, and pastors, operating on a two-semester system combining theoretical education and field training. Classes were held weekly on Monday evenings, with correspondence courses offered to overcome regional limitations. Lecturers included professors from Seoul National University, former deputy ministers of unification, senior pastors, and think tank researchers, providing a comprehensive education covering politics, economy, society, culture, and mission strategies. Graduates were awarded ‚ÄòKorean Christian Federation Certified North Korean Missionary‚Äô qualifications and were officially commissioned, marking ‚Äúa critical turning point in advancing North Korean mission from emotional zeal to systematic and institutionalized missionary movements.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Cornerstone Mission Society operated a five-stage North Korean Missionary Training School based in border regions with North Korea. This program had detailed step-by-step goals:
</p>
<p>
The first stage involved preparing returnees to North Korea for gospel ministry. The second stage focused on intensive Bible education for North Korean defectors. The third stage trained selected leaders through underground seminary programs. The fourth stage supported those needing to settle in China with pastoral care and leadership development. The fifth stage assisted those who could neither return to North Korea nor settle in China in migrating to third countries. Through this system, the ministry established a unique and strategic model for training North Korean defectors as missionaries.
</p>
<p>
Thus, by the late 1990s, the term ‚ÄúNorth Korean missionary‚Äù had become more than a symbolic concept; it evolved into a tangible professional and missional identity, encompassing institutional training, organized commissioning, and denominational support systems. Since direct entry into North Korea was impossible, missionaries operated mainly in third countries (China, Russia, Mongolia, etc.), engaging in ministries such as evangelism among North Korean defectors, supporting underground churches near borders, broadcasting Christian radio programs into North Korea, and smuggling Bibles and evangelistic materials.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, tensions existed between the evangelical and ecumenical camps. The evangelical side emphasized underground church work and direct evangelism through defectors, while the ecumenical side pursued peace and reconciliation missions through exchanges with the Korean Christian Federation (Jogeoryeon). For example, in 1995, the Korean National Council of Churches (KNCC) issued the ‚ÄúJubilee Declaration for National Unification,‚Äù advocating autonomous unification of the Korean Peninsula, confession of church culpability, and active peace and unification movements. This sparked intense discussions within Korean churches regarding the relationship between reunification and North Korean missions.
</p>
<p>
In the late 1990s, North Korea‚Äôs Korean Christian Federation (Jogeoryeon) actively sought exchanges with South Korean churches and overseas Christian organizations, leading to the formalization of mission channels. Not only humanitarian support through the Korean Red Cross but also diverse contacts via private missionary organizations increased.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the surge of North Korean mission in the 1990s was not merely a fleeting emotional enthusiasm but rather a complex phenomenon driven by political shifts (Inter-Korean Basic Agreement, Kim Il-sung‚Äôs death, famine crisis), religious changes (partial relaxation of North Korea‚Äôs religious policies), missionary strategy evolution (indirect missions, third-country missions), and internal theological tensions and convergence within Korean Christianity. Heo Seong-eop emphasized that ‚ÄúNorth Korean missions must not simply be driven by doctrinal zeal, but must emerge through theological reflection on historical contexts and a deep sense of national responsibility.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Immigrant Mission
</p>
<p>
Immigrant mission in Korea emerged as a new field of ministry in response to the increasing influx of foreign laborers and marriage migrants. Whereas Korean churches had previously concentrated on centrifugal mission‚Äîsending missionaries abroad‚Äîthis period marked the beginning of centripetal mission, wherein foreigners within Korea became direct subjects of ministry. This shift was not merely strategic but demanded theological reflection on the church‚Äôs identity and the essence of mission within a multicultural society.
</p>
<p>
The migrant mission effort was prompted by the introduction of the foreign industrial trainee system in 1991, which brought a rapid increase in foreign laborers. These laborers often lacked legal protections and worked under poor conditions in 3D industries (dirty, difficult, and dangerous), facing linguistic, legal, and cultural barriers. By the mid-1990s, undocumented laborers far outnumbered legal workers; in 1994 alone, of the total 81,824 foreign laborers in Korea, 48,231‚Äîapproximately 59%‚Äîwere undocumented.
</p>
<p>
Churches, especially those rooted in industrial mission, responded to this growing reality. Congregations in areas such as Guro, Ansan, and Incheon‚Äîindustrial hubs‚Äîlaunched holistic ministries that provided shelter, medical assistance, legal aid, Korean language classes, and bilingual worship services. For instance, Seonbu First Church in Ansan and several churches in the Guro industrial zone opened shelters and partnered with pro bono medical teams and legal counselors to support undocumented workers. In Incheon, Hanmaeum Church began holding multilingual worship services in 1997 and worked to build an inclusive faith community for foreign workers.
</p>
<p>
The Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK, Tonghap) played a leading institutional role in organizing these efforts. During the 1990s, the General Assembly‚Äôs Evangelism Department formally recognized migrant ministry as a central mission field and laid groundwork for multicultural ministry. Following a structural reorganization, the Domestic Mission Department took over and expanded efforts via ecumenical partnerships and global mission networks. Notably, from 1998, the PCK invited pastors from the Philippines, Nepal, and Bangladesh to serve as migrant ministry partners in Korea. These invited missionaries led ethnic-language worship services and provided pastoral care, language interpretation, and legal guidance.
</p>
<p>
Around the same time, churches also began responding to the needs of marriage migrants and multicultural families. Many foreign women who entered Korea through international marriage experienced isolation, cultural conflict, and social discrimination. Churches offered Korean language classes, cultural adaptation programs, and family support ministries. For example, Onyang First Church in Asan launched free Korean classes and Bible instruction for Vietnamese wives in 1999. In Busan, a local church ran ‚ÄúMulticultural Bible Camps‚Äù to support parent‚Äìchild bonding and identity formation.
</p>
<p>
Through these developments, migrant mission came to be understood not merely as an alternative mission strategy, but as mission in its own right. It offered a low-cost yet impactful way to expand God‚Äôs Kingdom among the nations living within Korea‚Äôs borders. Theologically, it called Korean churches to remember their own pilgrim identity: Christians, as described in the New Testament, are ‚Äúsojourners and exiles‚Äù on this earth (œÄŒ±œÅŒµœÄŒØŒ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøŒπ). Thus, welcoming migrants as co-citizens of the Kingdom of God became a core dimension of ecclesial faithfulness.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, not all church responses were ideal. Some large churches utilized migrant worship services primarily to expand church size or collect offerings, relegating migrant worship to off-hour slots or non-sanctuary spaces. Others continued to treat migrants as passive targets of evangelism, rather than full members of the body of Christ.
</p>
<p>
Despite these limitations, the 1990s marked a critical turning point as Korean churches began to reckon with their responsibility within a multicultural society. The vision of ‚Äúreverse mission‚Äù‚Äîwhere migrants received the gospel in Korea and returned to evangelize their home countries‚Äîalso emerged during this period. Migrant mission in the 1990s thus not only opened new possibilities for mission strategy but prompted Korean churches to reevaluate their identity and global calling in the changing world.
</p>
<p>
Changes in Korean Christian Civil Movements
</p>
<p>
From the late 1980s, South Korean society underwent dramatic democratic transformations, and Korean Christianity, too, entered a new phase of social engagement. The June Struggle of 1987 broke open the authoritarian regime, resulting in constitutional reform and the introduction of direct presidential elections. In this context, Korean churches began to transition from the radical protest style of minjung (people‚Äôs) movements toward more diverse and institutional modes of social involvement.
</p>
<p>
Up until the mid-1980s, social participation by Korean churches largely aligned with the minjung movement, rooted in minjung theology and direct resistance to military dictatorship. However, in the late 1980s, the landscape of social activism began to change. As the authoritarian state weakened and civic spaces expanded, resistance-based movements gave way to civil movements seeking reform within the system. The thesis notes that during this period, ‚Äúthe era of minjung movements was declared to be over, and the era of civil movements was said to have arrived‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
It was in this historical shift that the Christian Ethics Movement of Korea (CEMK, or Í∏∞Ïú§Ïã§) was founded in 1987. Led by respected Christian leaders such as Jang Gi-ryeo, Sohn Bong-ho, and Lee Man-yeol, CEMK emphasized ethical self-reflection and personal moral responsibility. The organization believed that ‚ÄúChristians must change society by first embodying moral integrity in their personal lives‚Äù. This vision differed from previous protest-based activism and aimed for reform through integrity, service, and public witness. It marked a significant redefinition of Christian civil activism in Korea. CEMK promoted values such as simplicity, honesty, rejection of corruption and bribery, ethical behavior in the workplace, and advocacy for the marginalized. In its guidelines, the group called on Christians to actively pursue economic justice, care for vulnerable populations, and fight against societal corruption. Their approach to civic engagement was intentionally apolitical yet committed to transformative public witness grounded in evangelical values. Meanwhile, from the late 1980s into the early 1990s, another stream of Christian activism emerged‚Äîinstitutional political participation. Unlike in the earlier dictatorship period, some Christian leaders now considered running for public office or engaging in policymaking. This shift sparked internal debate. Many feared that too much political involvement would compromise the church‚Äôs spiritual integrity and damage the public perception of Christianity. The question was not merely whether to engage politics, but how to do so while remaining faithful to the Gospel.
</p>
<p>
What defined this period, then, was a shift in both goals and methods. While earlier movements focused on resisting state repression, the post-1987 Christian civil movements began grappling with more complex, systemic issues: corruption, inequality, and social polarization. As the thesis argues, ‚Äúas social movements shifted from resistance to institutional reform, Christian civil movements also began to explore new directions‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Despite democratization and the expansion of civil society, internal tensions persisted within Korean churches. Some conservative denominations remained skeptical of civil engagement, viewing it as a secular compromise. Yet the evangelical reformist stream, represented by groups like CEMK, continued to gain traction. This tension pushed Christian civil movements to mature, seeking not only moral clarity but also strategic effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the period from the late 1980s to the 1990s marked a crucial transition in Korean Christian civil activism. It was characterized by(1) a shift from resistance-based minjung activism to civil reformism,(2) the rise of ethical civic engagement based on personal integrity,(3) increasing attempts at institutional political participation, and(4) internal struggles over the proper role of Christianity in public life.
</p>
<p>
This period can be understood as a time of strategic and theological reorientation, as the Korean church sought to embody its calling to be salt and light in a changing democratic society.

‚ÄúIt is My Fault‚Äù (Nae Tasi-o ÎÇ¥ ÌÉìÏù¥Ïò§) Movement
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, the ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù (Nae Tasi-o, ÎÇ¥ ÌÉìÏù¥Ïò§) movement launched by the Korean Catholic Church emerged as a movement of self-reflective social participation amidst the broader moral crisis and rising individualism in Korean society. This movement should not be understood as merely a religious slogan but as a serious response to the widespread social conflicts and collapse of ethics that followed democratization. Since the mid-1980s, South Korea had experienced growing regional divisions, labor disputes, and corruption scandals, during which a culture of shifting blame onto others became pervasive. It was within this context that the Catholic Lay Apostolate Council (ÌèâÏã†ÎèÑÏÇ¨ÎèÑÏßÅÌòëÏùòÌöå, hereafter referred to as the Lay Council) realized the urgent need to encourage individuals to take responsibility for the problems of society themselves.
</p>
<p>
The immediate inception of the ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù movement came in 1988 when the Lay Council proposed a ‚ÄúTrust Restoration Campaign‚Äù during the annual Catholic Laity Day. They selected the phrase ‚ÄúIt is my fault, my great fault‚Äù from the traditional penitential prayer in the Catholic Mass to symbolize the attitude of personal accountability rather than blaming external forces. Initially, however, the campaign received little public attention. The decisive turning point occurred in 1989, when then-Archbishop Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan attached a ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù sticker to the rear window of his personal car. Cardinal Kim declared, ‚ÄúOnly when we reflect on ourselves first can we find solutions,‚Äù thus awakening the national consciousness toward the need for humility and self-reflection.
</p>
<p>
Following this event, the campaign spread rapidly across the nation. The Lay Council produced more than 300,000 ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù car stickers, distributing them throughout churches and public venues, and by the early 1990s, vehicles bearing the sticker became a common sight in the streets of South Korea. The public resonated deeply with the message encapsulated in this single phrase, and what began as a religious initiative soon evolved into a broader social movement. Catholic parishes and dioceses encouraged not only the distribution of stickers but also incorporated the spirit of the campaign into homilies and catechetical education, urging believers to examine their own faults first in daily life. The movement‚Äôs goal extended beyond verbal affirmation, seeking to establish a culture of ethical living in personal relationships, workplaces, and broader society.
</p>
<p>
The key agents of this movement were the Catholic Lay Council and the Catholic Church leadership, most notably Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan. Cardinal Kim did not stop at symbolic participation; he consistently emphasized the spirit of ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù in his sermons, public lectures, and media interviews. His exemplary leadership gave the movement significant public credibility, prompting many non-Catholics to take notice. The media praised it as ‚Äúan invitation for the whole society to reflect and repent.‚Äù At that time, religious leaders still retained considerable social trust, which further amplified the campaign‚Äôs influence.
</p>
<p>
The significance of the ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù movement can be evaluated on three levels. First, on a personal level, it fostered a culture of self-examination, countering the prevailing blame-shifting tendencies of Korean society. Second, at the communal level, it served as a starting point for the restoration of social trust, encouraging individuals to take responsibility within their families, workplaces, and communities. Third, on a societal level, it set an ethical standard, calling leaders across political and business sectors to self-reflection and accountability. Cardinal Kim, among others, consistently urged public figures to embody the ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù spirit.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the movement also had clear limitations. Critics pointed out that emphasizing individual guilt without addressing structural injustices could deflect from the need for systemic reform. Some warned that ‚Äúexcessively personalizing all blame risks obscuring the real perpetrators and structural problems of society.‚Äù Over time, the movement gradually lost momentum, becoming reduced to a symbolic gesture by the mid-1990s. Despite this, its initial impact was profound: it challenged the complacent blame culture and elevated the value of personal conscience and humility within public discourse.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù movement remains an important example of ethical social participation initiated by the Korean Catholic Church. Though it did not result in lasting institutional reforms, it significantly contributed to shaping a moral discourse centered on responsibility, conscience, and communal trust during a period of societal turbulence. Even decades later, references to the ‚ÄúIt Is My Fault‚Äù spirit reemerged during national tragedies such as the Sewol Ferry Disaster, indicating that its symbolic significance remains potent today.
</p>
<p>
Catholic and Protestant Minjung Movement
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, the Korean Christian Minjung (people‚Äôs) movement encountered a major turning point. For Protestant Minjung churches, the era marked a shift from street-based, resistance-centered activism rooted in the 1970s‚Äì80s industrial mission tradition toward a more localized, community-oriented model. This was largely due to changing national conditions: the transition to democracy after 1987, the diffusion of social movements into the NGO sector, and the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (IMF crisis), which created deep, structural poverty. These factors redefined the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù (minjung) not simply as laborers or urban poor, but now also as irregular workers, the homeless, migrant laborers, runaway youth, and the elderly poor. The church had to develop new modes of presence, accompaniment, and solidarity amid these evolving conditions.
</p>
<p>
By the late 1990s, Korea‚Äôs Christian poverty ministries were shaped by both theological reflection and new social demands. The Minjung churches inherited the legacy of the industrial mission and liberation theology, but began to evolve toward community-based models that sought long-term empowerment. One scholar notes that ‚Äúby the 1990s, Minjung churches increasingly focused on job creation and welfare expansion through self-reliance support centers, rather than simply proclaiming liberation theology.‚Äù A representative example is Reverend Heo Byeong-seop‚Äôs Dongwol Church, which in 1990 founded the Wolsandong Construction Workers‚Äô Cooperative to directly address the livelihood crisis of day laborers.
</p>
<p>
Alongside this shift, Korean Christian poverty work began to intersect with the social economy movement. Scholars observe that ‚Äúby the late 1990s, Christian sectors initiated a wide range of social economy experiments‚Äîincluding self-reliant enterprises, credit unions, and local currency programs‚Äîbuilt on the legacy of Minjung theology and industrial mission.‚Äù These efforts were led by both Minjung churches and institutions like Sungkonghoe University. The aim was not only welfare provision but also structural alternatives to neoliberal austerity.
</p>
<p>
Key community-based examples during this period include Dail Community (founded in 1988), Bapsang Community (1998), the Ansan Migrant Center (starting in 1994 as a foreign labor counseling center), the study-room movement (begun in 1984 and rapidly expanded in the 1990s), and St.&nbsp;Francis College (established in 2005). These movements strove to build ‚Äúviable and alternative communities for the urban poor, including the homeless, single elders, migrant workers, and children in poverty.‚Äù Among them, Pastor Heo Ki-bok‚Äôs Bapsang Community developed what he called ‚Äúcreative welfare,‚Äù integrating daily meals, employment initiatives, and holistic self-reliance for the homeless as active subjects of change.
</p>
<p>
This trajectory should not be mistaken as a retreat from mission into charity. Rather, it reflects an intentional theological response to the structural violence of the market economy. Professor Cho Yong-hoon explains: ‚ÄúMission among the poor is not merely about saving souls, but about restoring their humanity and agency. The poor are not only objects of mission but the agents of it.‚Äù In this view, Christian poverty work is a form of holistic mission grounded in missio Dei‚Äîthe belief that God is already at work in the world‚Äôs pain, calling the church to participate in healing and justice.
</p>
<p>
For Protestant Minjung churches, this meant building new church forms‚Äîalternative worship spaces, communal economies, and hybrid organizations operating as both church and neighborhood center. It also required critical self-reflection, as aging congregations and the dispersal of the old Minjung movement led to internal doubts about identity and sustainability. Still, many continued to pursue grassroots pastoral care, local organizing, and new modes of public theology. Meanwhile, the Catholic Minjung-oriented movement evolved along a parallel but distinct path. Without formally establishing separate ‚ÄúMinjung churches,‚Äù the Catholic Church institutionalized its people-centered mission through structured ministries‚Äîsuch as the Catholic Priests‚Äô Association for Justice, labor pastoral centers, rural dioceses like Wonju, and welfare communities operated by religious orders. The iconic example of this is the House of Sharing, a healing and solidarity community for survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery. While not a parish, the community functions as a space where the wounds of history are remembered and God‚Äôs justice is embodied. Other initiatives included free meal services, shelters for migrant workers and runaway teens, and legal aid for the evicted.
</p>
<p>
What unites both traditions‚ÄîProtestant and Catholic‚Äîis their evolving interpretation of missio Dei. For Protestant theology, missio Dei reframed the church not as a missionary sender, but as a witness-participant in God‚Äôs ongoing work in the world. For Catholic theology, especially after Vatican II and Redemptoris Missio, the church‚Äôs mission was recast in trinitarian terms as participation in the loving, sending movement of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Both traditions thus emphasized that mission must take place where God is suffering‚Äîin the concrete lives of the poor, the excluded, and the displaced.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the Minjung mission in 1990s Korea cannot be reduced to either a continuation of liberation theology or a collapse into welfare services. It was an effort, on both Protestant and Catholic sides, to re-ground the meaning of Christian mission in the context of structural injustice, urban poverty, and neoliberal crisis. This movement laid the theological and organizational foundation for subsequent developments in Korea‚Äôs Christian engagement with social economy, ecological justice, and post-colonial reconciliation.

Christian Poverty Movement
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, Korean Christian poverty movements were grounded in the theological legacy of the Minjung Church Movement, which had emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as a prophetic alternative to institutional churches aligned with authoritarian regimes. This movement‚Äîbuilt on Minjung theology, liberation theology, and missio Dei‚Äîinterpreted Jesus‚Äô gospel as unfolding not above but among the oppressed, and called for communities that embodied this incarnational vision. As the 1990s introduced new socioeconomic crises, including the 1997 IMF financial collapse, poverty became increasingly multilayered. The Minjung Church tradition responded by forming grassroots Christian communities that sought not merely to alleviate poverty, but to stand in solidarity with ‚Äúthe new Minjung‚Äù‚Äîhomeless persons, migrant laborers, the working poor, and neglected children.
</p>
<p>
These Christian communities evolved from the legacy of earlier industrial missions and Minjung churches, such as those in the Guro district in the 1980s. During the 1990s, these churches increasingly separated from mainline denominational institutions and instead positioned themselves as independent communities rooted in the everyday lives of the poor. Their mission was not church growth, but the liberation and empowerment of oppressed people through deep engagement in labor activism, welfare organizing, and urban justice campaigns. However, in the wake of the IMF crisis, many of these churches encountered significant hardship. Membership declined, financial support dwindled, and internal tensions emerged over identity and strategy. In response, some Minjung churches began collaborating with NGOs and self-reliance centers, adopting social welfare approaches grounded in principles of participation and structural reform rather than charity alone.
</p>
<p>
Among the most prominent examples of this evolving movement were the Dure Community and the Dail Community. Both initiatives redefined what it meant to be a ‚Äúchurch‚Äù in the neoliberal city: they rejected hierarchical institutional structures and instead built egalitarian, shared-living communities in urban poverty zones.
</p>
<p>
The Dure Community, founded in Neunggok-dong in Goyang City, established a lifestyle-based faith community among urban poor populations‚Äîunemployed persons, disabled people, day laborers, and elderly citizens. The community emphasized collective labor, shared meals, communal child-rearing, and mutual care as expressions of the gospel. Worship was not held in a building but enacted through daily life. Theologically, Dure was rooted in the Minjung understanding of the Kingdom of God as a communal restoration of justice and dignity. Their practice was built not around Sunday worship but around ‚Äúliving the gospel‚Äù through a just economic and social order
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the Dail Community emerged in 1988 when Rev.&nbsp;Il-do Choi began offering free meals to homeless persons near Cheongnyangni Station in Seoul. From this act of service grew a network of faith-based welfare institutions‚Äîsoup kitchens, homeless shelters, rehabilitation centers, community libraries, and children‚Äôs study rooms. Dail‚Äôs philosophy rested on a simple but radical idea: ‚ÄúThe gospel is a bowl of rice.‚Äù Eucharist was reinterpreted as a shared meal with the poor, and salvation was understood as communal healing and reconciliation through presence. Rather than seek converts or grow the church institutionally, Dail sought to ‚Äúbecome bread‚Äù to its neighbors.
</p>
<p>
Both communities expanded the boundaries of the Minjung Church movement. They were living enactments of missio Dei, not in institutional or evangelical terms, but as the embodied presence of God‚Äôs love in the suffering of the world. Their ministry was grounded in the conviction that ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Kingdom is realized in the suffering of the Minjung,‚Äù and that to serve, live with, and love the Minjung is to live out the gospel.
</p>
<p>
These experiments also demonstrated a willingness to reformulate Christian witness in the face of the growing secularization and privatization of religion. As institutional megachurches increasingly prioritized individual salvation, material prosperity, and political conservatism, Dure and Dail offered alternative forms of public faith‚Äîa Christianity that restored the communal, incarnational, and prophetic dimensions of the gospel. They rejected the consumerism and clericalism that had overtaken Korean Protestantism and instead reaffirmed that ‚Äúthe church is not a building but a community of shared suffering.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The significance of these communities can be summarized in four points. First, they developed Christian responses to new forms of urban poverty‚Äîhomelessness, unemployment, precarious labor, and social exclusion. Second, they embodied a model of social mission that integrated welfare and spirituality. Third, they acknowledged internal critiques‚Äîsuch as the charge of becoming ‚ÄúMinjung-less Minjung Churches‚Äù‚Äîand sought new ways to restore participation and solidarity. Finally, they provided a living answer to the theological question of what the church must be in an age of neoliberalism and spiritual crisis.
</p>
<p>
Today, these community movements remain vital reminders that the church‚Äôs mission is not primarily to grow in number, but to embody the gospel where suffering is most acute. The Minjung Church Movement, in its transformation through communities like Dure and Dail, continues to pose the question: Whose side is the church on?

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-theological-issues">Key Theological Issues</h2>
<div>
Female Ordination
<p></p>
<p>
In the 1990s, the issue of female ordination emerged as a full-fledged institutional controversy in South Korea, with the debate sharply divided between two major Presbyterian denominations: the Presbyterian Church of Korea (PCK Tonghap) and the General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (PCK Hapdong). This was not merely a dispute over institutional reform but rather a comprehensive reflection of theological identity, biblical interpretation methods, and perspectives on female leadership within the church.
</p>
<p>
In 1994, the PCK Tonghap officially approved female ordination at its 79th General Assembly, with 701 votes in favor, 612 against, and 8 abstentions. The following year, the constitutional amendment was finalized through presbytery-level ratification, allowing women to sit for the ordination examination beginning in 1996. That autumn, 19 women became the first officially ordained female ministers within the denomination. This marked the culmination of over sixty years of petitions and deliberations, dating back to the 1933 request for female elders. Meanwhile, the PCK Hapdong strongly opposed the decision. It reaffirmed its opposition to female ordination in its journal Shinhak Jinam in 1996 and 1997 and reiterated this position at its 83rd General Assembly in 1998. Although some limited measures were discussed‚Äîsuch as granting female missionaries temporary sacramental authority or acknowledging calls for female military chaplains‚Äîthe denomination maintained its rejection of female ministerial ordination.
</p>
<p>
At the core of this debate lay a theological clash between egalitarianism and complementarianism. Egalitarians cited Genesis 1:27 (‚Äúmale and female He created them in the image of God‚Äù) and Galatians 3:28 (‚Äúthere is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus‚Äù) as central affirmations that women could rightfully exercise leadership in the church. They also called for critical, historical-contextual interpretation of Pauline prohibitions such as 1 Corinthians 14:34‚Äì35 and 1 Timothy 2:12. Notably, New Testament scholar Seyoon Kim argued that the passage in 1 Corinthians 14 was a later interpolation and should not be viewed as reflecting Paul‚Äôs original stance on women. By contrast, complementarians asserted a divinely ordained distinction between male and female roles, especially in church leadership. Wayne Grudem argued that Scripture consistently prohibits women from holding office as pastors or elders, affirming that ‚Äúthe consistent position of the church throughout history has been to reserve such offices for men.‚Äù He viewed this not as a culturally contingent norm, but as rooted in the created order. Korean theologian Park Hyung-ryong similarly maintained that Paul‚Äôs teachings represented a universal and timeless truth applicable to all churches, not merely to local contexts.
</p>
<p>
This clash extended beyond exegesis to deeper theological debates concerning anthropology, ecclesiology, and even divine ontology. Linda Belleville, an advocate of egalitarianism, accused complementarianism of entrenching patriarchal authority structures and reinforcing gender-based hierarchies in the name of tradition. In response, complementarians warned that egalitarianism imported secular ideologies into the church, thereby weakening the authority of Scripture and destabilizing the ordained church order.
</p>
<p>
The decision by the PCK Tonghap to ordain women was not confined to internal policy but resonated widely across Korean society. Women‚Äôs organizations and progressive media outlets welcomed it as a breakthrough against patriarchal religious structures. Women‚Äôs News praised the shift, declaring that ‚Äúa church without women in ministry is no longer imaginable.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Conservative Christian media and leaders, however, expressed fierce opposition. The Christian Bulletin (Kidosinbo) denounced the decision as ‚Äúa humanistic move that destroys the order of Scripture,‚Äù and some congregations even launched petition campaigns to reverse the change. The PCK Hapdong continued to uphold its complementarian stance, reiterating in 1998 that female evangelists may be honored but not ordained.
</p>
<p>
While this debate initiated institutional reforms, many challenges persisted. Although women could now be ordained in the PCK Tonghap, they faced structural limitations in practice. Very few female pastors secured senior pastor positions or influential roles in presbytery leadership. Theologian Seo Young-im observed that ‚Äúthe number of ordained women increased steadily, but most served in assistant roles or specialized ministries,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe male-dominated structure of the church remained deeply entrenched.‚Äù In response, women ministers began to form collective networks to address these structural challenges. Organizations such as the Korean Association of Women Pastors and the National Council of Women Ministers emerged to advocate for leadership development, combat discrimination, and enhance public perceptions of female pastors. At the same time, scholars like Jung Mi-hyun, Oh Sung-choon, and Choi Young-shil advanced feminist theological critiques of male-centered ecclesiology and biblical language. The issue also gained international visibility. Global ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Presbyterian Church (USA) highlighted Korea‚Äôs ordination reform as a leading case among Asian churches. The PCK Tonghap gained recognition for integrating female leadership into its denominational structure. Nevertheless, many conservative denominations‚Äîincluding the PCK Hapdong and the Kosin Church‚Äîcontinued to reject female ordination on the grounds that ecclesiastical offices must follow the divinely instituted order. This divide has created ongoing theological rifts within Korean Protestantism and continues to impede interdenominational cooperation in areas such as social engagement, ecumenical work, and joint missions.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the debate over women‚Äôs ordination in 1990s Korea was more than a policy dispute; it was a watershed moment that exposed deep tensions in theology, gender ideology, and institutional power. The conflict between egalitarian and complementarian frameworks continues to shape Korean ecclesial identity and structure to this day.
</p>
<p>
New Apostolic Reformation (NAR)
</p>
<p>
In the mid-1990s, the Korean church was confronted with the growing spread of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), prompting strong responses from various conservative denominations and theologians. These disputes were not merely differences in theological interpretation or cultural practice, but rather structural confrontations involving the authority of Scripture, the cessation of divine revelation, the nature of ecclesial polity, and the essence of worship.
</p>
<p>
NAR advocates claimed that the offices of apostles and prophets should be restored in the modern church and that they must exercise the highest authority over ecclesial leadership. Through apostolic governance and prophetic revelation, they asserted their role in determining the direction of the church, bypassing traditional denominational systems. Moreover, phenomena such as falling, trembling, gold dust, ‚Äúglory clouds,‚Äù and miraculous healings were framed as essential manifestations of God‚Äôs presence in worship. These features clashed sharply with the principles of sola scriptura and the cessationist tradition upheld by conservative Reformed theology.
</p>
<p>
In 1995, the Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap) passed a resolution to prohibit the introduction of the Vineyard Movement, citing its overemphasis on sensory and mystical experiences that threatened to distort the essence of Christian worship. The Vineyard Movement promoted phenomena such as prophecy, healing, and emotional outbursts (e.g., laughter, crying, falling), which were seen as undermining the traditional liturgical order.
</p>
<p>
In 2007, the Kosin General Assembly declared NAR teachings to be ‚Äúextremely unsound doctrine‚Äù and prohibited the reading of related literature, the invitation of NAR-affiliated speakers, and participation in related gatherings. The Kosin denomination saw NAR as promoting extra-biblical revelation, dismantling orthodox theology, and disrupting the established ecclesial order.
</p>
<p>
In 2009, the Hapdong denomination officially labeled NAR teachings as heretical and adopted a resolution banning all participation and fellowship. The denomination criticized the NAR for creating a new spiritual hierarchy within the church and undermining the closed canon of Scripture by elevating apostolic and prophetic utterances above biblical authority. In addition to these theological concerns, all three denominations expressed alarm at how the movement‚Äôs emphasis on autonomous experience and subjective authority bypassed denominational discipline and encouraged division among congregations.
</p>
<p>
These responses were not based on surface-level disagreement but stemmed from a deeply rooted conviction that the NAR posed a fundamental threat to the theological identity, liturgical order, and public authority of the Korean church. Even today, the boundaries established during the 1990s continue to serve as critical guardrails in Korean evangelical theology.

Conservatism, Liberalism, Progressivism, and Evangelicalism
</p>
<p>
The 1990s was a pivotal period in Korean Christianity, marked by theological transitions, tensions, and reformulations across conservative, liberal, progressive, and evangelical traditions. Each stream grappled with its own internal crises while engaging in broader debates about church identity, theological integrity, and growth. These interactions generated both innovation and fragmentation in the theological landscape of the Korean church.
</p>
<p>
Conservative theology, particularly represented by denominations such as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (PCK, Hapdong and Kosin), sought to maintain the legacy of Reformed orthodoxy rooted in the Westminster Confession. However, facing stagnation in church growth, some conservative theologians initiated a turn toward evangelicalism. This movement, as exemplified by figures like Park Yun-sun, maintained biblical inerrancy while emphasizing gospel-centered preaching. Yet this transition also blurred boundaries with revivalism and pragmatic church-growth ideologies, raising concerns about theological dilution.
</p>
<p>
Liberal theology, primarily affiliated with the Methodist Church, entered a period of self-criticism. The decline in church vitality and social influence prompted some within the tradition to adopt more evangelical elements or to seek new relevance through practical ministry. However, this shift sparked intense conflict. In some instances, liberal theologians were even expelled from their denominations for perceived doctrinal deviation. While liberal theology had historically emphasized reason, experience, and pluralism, it now faced a credibility crisis amid calls for biblical fidelity and ecclesial renewal.
</p>
<p>
Progressive theology, as developed by the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (PROK), retained its focus on contextual and socially engaged theology, particularly through the legacy of Minjung Theology. The 1990s witnessed attempts to expand this framework into ecological, cultural, and postcolonial directions. Yet progressive theology also faced diminished mass appeal and internal debates about its political alignment, leading to reflection on how to balance prophetic engagement with ecclesial sustainability.
</p>
<p>
Evangelical theology became the most influential theological movement of the decade. Emphasizing scriptural authority, personal conversion, and mission, it was adopted across denominational lines. However, in Korea, evangelicalism was increasingly intertwined with pragmatism and prosperity theology. Large churches adopted growth-centered strategies and spiritualized material success, resulting in widespread criticism of the commercialization of faith and the loss of theological depth.

Expansion of Christian Heresies
</p>
<p>
The 1990s marked a dramatic turning point in South Korea‚Äôs religious landscape, as numerous Christian heretical movements‚Äîmost notably JMS, Shincheonji, the Church of God, and the Guwonpa (Salvation Sect)‚Äîexpanded their reach and visibility. Amidst rapid modernization and social unrest, particularly during the 1997‚Äì98 IMF crisis, these groups capitalized on spiritual confusion, dissatisfaction with institutional churches, and eschatological fears to attract vulnerable populations, especially youth and women.
</p>
<p>
JMS (Jesus Morning Star), led by Jung Myung-seok, emerged from the Unification Church and rapidly expanded in the 1990s through university-based recruiting. Jung‚Äôs strategy involved establishing pseudo-student clubs and cultural organizations centered on cheerleading, dance, modeling, and sports to attract elite university students. Despite growing social criticism following the 1999 ‚ÄúHwangyang Abduction Case‚Äù and televised investigative reports, JMS maintained its organizational coherence. It continued to appeal to youth through seemingly harmless activities that concealed its indoctrination process and veneration of Jung as a messianic figure.
</p>
<p>
Shincheonji, founded in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, initiated aggressive expansion strategies in the 1990s through free Bible centers, disguised theological schools, and infiltration of traditional churches. The group implemented a step-by-step recruitment system, beginning with assessing ‚Äúignorance,‚Äù attacking mainstream churches, gradually teaching Shincheonji doctrine, and finally revealing the true identity of the group. Lee was presented as the only mediator of salvation, and scripture was interpreted allegorically to reinforce exclusivist beliefs. The group employed tactics such as ‚Äúharvest workers‚Äù to sow division within congregations and replace leadership from within.
</p>
<p>
The World Mission Society Church of God, formerly known as the Ahn Sahng-Hong Witnesses, also gained prominence during this period. After the failed prophecy of Ahn‚Äôs return in 1988, the group continued to promote doomsday messages such as the 1997 and 1999 end-time claims. They emphasized observance of Saturday Sabbath and the Passover, rejected Christmas and Easter as pagan rituals, and revered both Ahn and his spiritual ‚Äúbride,‚Äù Jang Gil-ja, as divine figures. Their proselytization often took the form of door-to-door surveys targeting Christian homes, where doctrinal critiques led to persistent invitations to Bible studies.
</p>
<p>
The Guwonpa (Salvation Sect), particularly under Park Ok-soo, posed a distinct challenge due to its claim to affirm biblical authority while deviating significantly from orthodox soteriology. Emphasizing one-time ‚Äúrealization-based‚Äù salvation, Park downplayed repentance and ethical transformation, attracting many through the promise of absolute assurance. During the 1990s, this sect actively targeted high school and university students with youth camps and charismatic teaching events, promoting the image of being more spiritually ‚Äúpure‚Äù than mainstream churches.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the infamous 1992 failed prophecy by Dami Mission, which predicted the rapture in October of that year, caused national hysteria and became a turning point in public awareness of end-times heresies. Many groups, including the Church of God and Guwonpa, recycled similar eschatological claims to maintain urgency among followers. The Unification Church, while institutionally stabilized by the 1990s, continued to serve as a doctrinal foundation for derivative groups such as JMS.
</p>
<p>
This period also witnessed the failure of traditional churches to adequately respond. Theological illiteracy among laypeople, institutional corruption, and pastoral authoritarianism created fertile ground for sectarian infiltration. Many churches only began confronting the problem after experiencing internal disruption. Consequently, several denominations issued formal heresy declarations only in the mid-1990s, lagging behind the rapid expansion of these groups.
</p>
<p>
Sociologically, Korea‚Äôs religious environment‚Äîmarked by syncretism, Shamanistic tendencies, and pragmatic spiritualism‚Äîalso contributed to the appeal of heretical movements. Their emotional intensity, prophetic claims, and promises of certainty offered an alternative to bureaucratized and disenchanted institutional religion. For many youth and marginalized individuals, these groups represented not just theological alternatives but communities of belonging and purpose.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the 1990s represent a critical era in which Korean Christian heresies grew both in complexity and social impact. Their strategies became increasingly intelligent, their teachings more theologically radical, and their outreach more targeted. This decade laid the foundation for their continued presence in the 21st century and underscored the urgent need for doctrinal education and spiritual discernment within the Korean church.
</p>
<p>
Rapture Prediction Incident in 1992
</p>
<p>
On October 28, 1992, South Korea witnessed an unprecedented outbreak of rapture hysteria, incited by a fringe Christian movement known as the Mission for the Coming Days (Dami Seonkyohwe). Far beyond a failed prophetic claim, the incident exposed deep theological vulnerabilities in the Korean Protestant landscape. Thousands of families were torn apart, careers and studies abandoned, and the authority of the church undermined. At the center of the movement stood Lee Jang-rim, a self-proclaimed prophet and former lay translator, whose teachings blended dispensational premillennialism, new revelations, and fear-based eschatology to mobilize a nationwide religious fervor.
</p>
<p>
Lee, who dropped out of Methodist Theological Seminary in his first year, had a background in Pentecostal and Holiness movements and spent over a decade working in Christian publishing. Through exposure to American eschatological texts‚Äîsuch as The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey, Raptured by Ernest Angley, and I Saw Heaven by Percy Collet‚Äîhe formed a uniquely Korean version of rapture theology, which eventually coalesced into a specific date: October 28, 1992 . Lee claimed this date was confirmed through the visions of a high school student named ‚ÄúJingun,‚Äù who allegedly received prophetic dreams.
</p>
<p>
The intensity of belief surrounding this date reached extreme proportions. Followers, estimated at around 20,000, sold their homes, quit jobs, severed family ties, and relocated to communes to prepare for the rapture. Some believers testified to seeing supernatural signs‚Äîpillars of fire and clouds‚Äîon the predicted date. Many claimed spiritual experiences and visions during collective worship sessions in the weeks leading up to October 28. These phenomena, which psychologists later interpreted as mass hallucination and group hypnosis, were cited by followers as divine confirmation.
</p>
<p>
When October 28 passed uneventfully, the aftermath was catastrophic. Only about 5% of the followers returned to their previous churches, while up to 60% became disillusioned, suffered mental health breakdowns, or turned to atheism. Entire families had collapsed. Young adults abandoned studies and careers. Church communities, caught unprepared, responded poorly. Most churches failed to embrace those who returned, often viewing them as spiritually compromised. For many, the disappointment transitioned into a deep distrust of institutional religion.
</p>
<p>
Even more concerning, a number of leaders involved in the 1992 prediction disappeared for a time and later resurfaced under new names, launching alternative cult movements with slightly modified doctrines. Experts at the time warned that once someone was fully absorbed by false revelations, recovery was unlikely, and relapse into new cultic ideologies was common.
</p>
<p>
The institutional church‚Äôs response was slow and fragmented. While some denominations‚Äîsuch as the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Tonghap and Hapdong branches)‚Äîissued formal heresy declarations against Lee Jang-rim by 1991, most pastors and congregations initially dismissed the movement as fringe. This allowed the message to spread relatively unchecked. After the failure of the prophecy, many in the church realized that they had neglected theological instruction and discernment training within their congregations.
</p>
<p>
In a detailed postmortem, Professor Park Yong-gyu outlined several key factors contributing to the disaster. First was the collapse of doctrinal education. Korean churches had drifted away from systematic theology, including instruction on salvation, revelation, and eschatology. Second, there was confusion between spiritual inspiration and revelation. Many believers misinterpreted dreams, emotions, or intuition as divine prophecy. Third, supernatural experience had displaced biblical authority. Visions, speaking in tongues, and ecstatic encounters were mistakenly elevated as normative faith experiences.
</p>
<p>
Park also emphasized that Korean churches failed to teach that the date of Christ‚Äôs return is unknowable. While Lee‚Äôs followers cited verses like John 16:13 (‚ÄúHe will tell you what is yet to come‚Äù), they ignored Matthew 24:36, where Jesus clearly states that ‚Äúno one knows the day or hour.‚Äù Misreading such passages allowed Lee to claim divine insight into the rapture date, despite scripture‚Äôs explicit warning. Furthermore, there was almost no theological emphasis on the Trinity, or a robust doctrine of biblical sufficiency. Lee‚Äôs followers believed that salvation was attainable through ‚Äúmerit‚Äù‚Äînot by grace through faith‚Äîbut by participating in communal rapture training and offering financial support .
</p>
<p>
Finally, the rapture panic exposed the widespread emotionalism and mysticism in Korean Protestantism. Faith became increasingly grounded in ecstatic experience, not in Scripture. Dreams, visions, and private revelations were treated as trustworthy guides, often surpassing the Bible itself in authority. The 1992 incident showed that in the absence of careful theological instruction, even well-meaning Christians could be swept into heresy.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the Dami movement‚Äôs failure was not simply a false prophecy; it was a mirror reflecting the spiritual and theological immaturity of the Korean church. The legacy of 1992 continues in various forms today‚Äîwhether through charismatic leaders claiming new revelations, ‚Äúprophetic ministries‚Äù on YouTube, or fringe apocalyptic cults. The year 1992 was not the end of the world‚Äîbut in many ways, it was judgment day for Korean Protestantism.

Ïù¥Î¨∏Ïó¥ ÊùéÊñáÁÉà Mun-yeol Yi
<p></p>
<p>
06/24/1948 ~ Present
</p>
<p>
Although Lee Mun-yeol should not be categorized as a militant opponent of Christianity, his persistent critical stance toward Christian theology and worldview positions him as a significant anti-Christian intellectual figure of the 1990s. Throughout his literary career, particularly in works such as Son of Man (1979), Lee engaged Christianity not through outright hostility but through rigorous existential questioning. He framed Christianity not simply as a religious faith but as a Western ideological force competing with East Asian traditions such as Confucianism. Lee Mun-yeol is fundamentally a conservative writer deeply attached to Confucian traditions and held a strong sense of resistance toward Western civilization, which included Christianity as a major subset. For Lee, Christianity was not merely a religion but a symbolic force representing the cultural and philosophical conflict between East and West, framed primarily through the issue of ‚Äúpower.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
His major work, Son of Man (1979), deeply explores the theological foundation of Christianity while maintaining a critical stance. In this novel, Lee addresses core theological questions that had been prominent in 19th-century liberal theology: the tension between the divinity and humanity of Jesus, the question of whether Christianity emerged from Jesus‚Äô own teachings or from Paul‚Äôs reinterpretation, and the absolute authority of the Scriptures. By portraying the divided consciousness of Jesus‚ÄîHis divinity and humanity‚Äîthrough the characters Min Yo-seop and Ahaseuerus, Lee invites readers to wrestle with the essential question: ‚ÄúWas Jesus truly both fully divine and fully human?‚Äù Son of Man also raises the issue of how a new religion‚ÄîChristianity‚Äîcould have emerged from a Jewish prophet like Jesus. Through the relationship between Min Yo-seop and Jo Dong-pal, Lee draws a parallel between Jesus and Paul, suggesting provocatively that ‚ÄúChristianity originated from Jesus but was ultimately shaped by Paul‚Äôs theology.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
During the 1990s, although Lee did not bring Christianity back to the forefront of his later novels as he had in Son of Man, his deep engagement with Christian motifs persisted. As Cha Jungsik observed, Lee Mun-yeol should be seen as a writer who ‚Äúinternalized Christian theological images and motifs,‚Äù even though he was not a Christian himself. That is, Lee did not explicitly present himself as a Christian author, yet biblical themes and questions about the relationship between God and humanity continued to permeate his work.
</p>
<p>
From a theological perspective, Lee‚Äôs approach to Christianity was notably unique. Rather than rejecting or ridiculing Christianity outright, he seriously grappled with the existential questions Christianity poses, while simultaneously casting doubt on its ultimate answers. His literary world consistently interrogated the human condition through the lens of Christianity without offering simplistic or triumphant resolutions.
</p>
<p>
However, scholars have also pointed out limitations in Lee‚Äôs perspective. As Lee Dong-ha argued, because Lee centered his exploration around ‚Äúthe problem of power‚Äù in a highly secular and confrontational manner, true theological dialogue or mutual openness with Christianity was never fully realized. Christianity remained, in his eyes, an ultimately rival force against his deeply rooted East Asian traditionalism.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the significance of Lee Mun-yeol‚Äôs engagement with Christianity during the 1990s can be summarized as follows:
</p>
<p>
First, he accomplished one of the rare serious literary explorations of theological issues in modern Korean literature.
</p>
<p>
Second, he moved beyond both missionary literature and dismissive secular readings by treating Christianity as an existential human condition.
</p>
<p>
Third, he bequeathed to readers not a simplistic call to faith, but a profound intellectual engagement with the fundamental questions Christianity raises.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Lee Mun-yeol stands as one of the most daring and complex figures in Korean literary history with regard to Christianity. Without identifying as a Christian himself, he nevertheless opened new intellectual and literary spaces for dialogue between Korean literature and Christian theology. His work challenged and expanded the boundaries of religious inquiry in Korean literature, offering readers a unique example of how literature can meaningfully engage theology without religious affiliation. Although Lee Mun-yeol was not a Christian, he significantly influenced Korean perceptions of Christianity by presenting it as a critical existential problem rather than merely a foreign ideology. His literary interrogation of Christian theology helped establish a new model for incorporating Christian motifs in Korean modern literature beyond simple advocacy or rejection.

Korean Federation of University Student Councils
<p></p>
<p>
The formation of an anti-Christian culture on Korean university campuses was not merely a matter of negative sentiment toward Christianity, but was deeply connected to ideological shifts within the student movement, evolving political identities, and changes in the socio-cultural structure of campus life. At the center of this transformation stood the Korean Federation of University Student Councils (HanChongRyun), which based its ideological foundation on Kim Il-sung‚Äôs Juche ideology and regarded Christianity as a religion complicit with capitalism and conservative political powers. From this perspective, Christianity was not merely a belief system but a hegemonic tool of oppression, thereby justifying the proliferation of anti-Christian sentiment in campus activism.
</p>
<p>
Student movements were not initially anti-Christian. During the 1980s democratization era, many Christian youth participated actively in human rights and justice-centered activism. However, as the 1990s progressed, Marxist-Leninist thought, anti-imperialism, and Juche ideology became dominant currents within the student movement, and Christianity was increasingly criticized as a bourgeois religion, a colonial remnant, and an anti-revolutionary structure. Despite some overlap with liberation theology or Minjung theology, Christian student groups were increasingly marginalized and dismissed as ‚Äúnon-struggling religious conformists.‚Äù In the midst of this, Christian Student Union (Giyeon) emerged as a response. Beginning in 1990 with the formation of the ‚ÄúSeoul National University Christian Union,‚Äù similar groups were established at Korea University (1991), and by 1993, at Myongji University, Sogang University, Yonsei University, Ewha Womans University, and Hongik University. These groups organized joint Christmas events and campus-wide worship services, and in 1994, they formed the ‚ÄúNew General Christian Student Union,‚Äù which expanded to a broader regional network in 1995 through regular Giyeon retreats.
</p>
<p>
Despite these efforts, Giyeon members faced significant structural and cultural barriers. Because many university student councils were controlled by HanChongRyun-aligned activists, Christian groups were often denied access to campus facilities, limited in their event planning, and restricted from posting announcements. Their presence on campuses dominated by political demonstrations and nationalist rhetoric was interpreted as passive or even traitorous. Even worship and prayer meetings were ridiculed as naive and politically neutral, rather than courageous acts of conscience.
</p>
<p>
Tensions intensified as HanChongRyun advanced the notion of ‚ÄúCriticism of Pure Academism,‚Äù denouncing students focused on academic achievement as bourgeois collaborators. In this environment, Christian students who emphasized personal faith and scholarship were portrayed as socially irresponsible. In some cases, Christian campus groups were directly excluded from campus life, or found their meeting times overlapped with political rallies, creating unavoidable conflict. Under such scrutiny, even regular worship gatherings had to be carried out discreetly.
</p>
<p>
Anti-Christian sentiment was also spread systematically through educational and ideological training. HanChongRyun developed a multi-stage ‚Äúconsciousness-raising program‚Äù using student orientations, MTs (Membership Trainings), and cultural events. These programs emphasized dissatisfaction with reality (Stage 1), critique of capitalism (Stage 2), and revolutionary socialist theory (Stage 3), wherein Christianity was dismissed as false consciousness aligned with imperialism and bourgeois power. Propaganda materials‚Äîsuch as BBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúKill ‚ÄôEm All‚Äù or footage from North Korea‚Äîwere shown to new students to incite anti-American and anti-Christian attitudes simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Culturally, anti-Christian sentiments were embedded in the organization of campus events. Student councils often promoted performances and festivals filled with vulgarity and violence, intentionally conflicting with Christian values. Rallies and protests were sometimes scheduled to interrupt Christian worship services. Campus newspapers, flyers, and performances further spread mockery and criticism of Christianity. This made it psychologically difficult for Christian students to publicly identify as believers.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the anti-Christian culture of the 1990s was shaped by ideological hostility, institutional marginalization, cultural antagonism, and educational indoctrination. These dynamics deeply affected not only the religious life of Christian students but also their social identity and participation in campus life. Yet in the midst of this environment, the Giyeon movement persisted‚Äîcultivating solidarity among Christian students, advocating a gospel-centered alternative vision, and planting the seeds of spiritual renewal that would bear fruit in later decades.

Christianity under Persecution in North Korea
<p></p>
<p>
Throughout the 1990s, Christianity in North Korea existed under the most repressive ideological regime in East Asia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the onset of North Korea‚Äôs own economic disaster‚Äîknown as the ‚ÄúArduous March‚Äù‚Äîthe government faced internal strain and international isolation. Within this context, religious belief, particularly Christianity, was considered fundamentally subversive. As Juche ideology continued to define the metaphysical and moral structure of North Korean society, Christians were systematically targeted as enemies of the revolution and as carriers of foreign influence.
</p>
<p>
The most immediate form of repression during this decade was the intensified persecution of underground churches. As famine and hardship forced tens of thousands of North Koreans across the border into China, many encountered Christian missionaries or Korean churches there. Some were converted and returned to North Korea, bringing with them Bibles and an underground evangelical fervor that spread primarily through family networks. However, this posed a direct threat to the ideological control of the state, and the government responded with violent suppression. Numerous cases have been documented in which Christians were arrested, tortured, publicly executed, or sent with their entire families to political prison camps such as Yodok.
</p>
<p>
One of the most chilling examples was the execution of a woman named Ri Hyeon-ok in 2009 (widely understood to reflect practices continuing from the 1990s). She was reportedly shot in public for distributing Bibles, while her family members were sent to a prison camp. Earlier, in 2006, a former North Korean army officer named Son Jong-nam was arrested for preaching Christianity. He was reportedly tortured in Pyongyang‚Äôs State Security Department detention center and died in 2008 from internal injuries sustained under interrogation. These incidents were not isolated but part of a broader pattern in which any expression of Christian faith‚Äîprayer, possession of a Bible, or even the act of singing hymns‚Äîwas criminalized under charges of espionage or treason.
</p>
<p>
This climate of repression was underpinned by the regime‚Äôs view of Christianity as ideologically incompatible with Juche thought. While Kim Il-sung declared in his memoirs that Christian values of peace and harmony did not contradict his worldview, in practice, the state emphasized absolute loyalty to the ‚ÄúSuryong‚Äù (Leader) and framed Christianity as a foreign-born ideology that disrupted national unity.‚Åµ The philosophical and theological conflict between the transcendental God of Christianity and the deified image of the Kim dynasty was irreconcilable in the state‚Äôs cultural policy.
</p>
<p>
Despite the brutal crackdown on unofficial religious life, the North Korean government maintained the appearance of religious tolerance for external audiences. State-controlled institutions like the Korean Christian Federation (KCF), Bongsu Church, and Changchung Catholic Cathedral were revitalized or built during the late 1980s and showcased throughout the 1990s as evidence of religious freedom. These were, however, under strict surveillance by the Ministry of State Security. Services were often choreographed for visiting delegations from the World Council of Churches or South Korean religious representatives. Former defectors and researchers have noted that congregants were often selected party members, and sermons carefully scripted.
</p>
<p>
Within North Korean society itself, anyone with a Christian family background was stigmatized. According to the country‚Äôs ‚Äúsongbun‚Äù classification system, descendants of Christian families were labeled as ‚Äúimpure‚Äù and denied access to higher education, residence in Pyongyang, or Party membership. This form of inherited guilt functioned as a long-term mechanism of religious repression, ensuring the containment of Christianity not only as a faith but as a social identity.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, even in these dire conditions, Christianity did not disappear. Hidden worship continued in small domestic gatherings. Families passed down prayers and scriptures in secret. The number of active underground believers may have remained small, but their survival testifies to a faith resilient under extreme duress. Scholars and defector testimonies suggest that Christian households persisted by integrating faith into intimate kin networks and preserving oral traditions. This invisible church‚Äîdistinct from the state-sponsored KCF‚Äîremained deeply rooted in both theological conviction and political defiance.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1990s marked a paradoxical decade for North Korean Christianity: a time of brutal suppression and quiet endurance. While state ideology portrayed religion as a relic of the past and a threat to national security, underground believers risked their lives to worship. Their existence stood as a form of spiritual resistance, one that the regime could suppress but never entirely erase.
