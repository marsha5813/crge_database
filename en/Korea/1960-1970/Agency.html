Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.
</p>
<p>
These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

Rev.&nbsp;George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers‚Äô rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br><br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

<p>
During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

<p>
The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

<p>
Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.
</p>
<p>
These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers‚Äô rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br><br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

<p>
The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>

The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

<p>
Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.
</p>
<p>
These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

Rev.&nbsp;George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers‚Äô rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br><br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

<p>
During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>

In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

<p>
Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.
</p>
<p>
These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

<p>
The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers‚Äô rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable.

From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br><br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

<p>
During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

<p>
The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

<p>
Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.

These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

Rev.&nbsp;George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers‚Äô rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br><br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

<p>
The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.

<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.
</p>
<p>
These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

Rev.&nbsp;George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers‚Äô rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br><br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

<p>
The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

<p>
Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.
</p>
<p>
These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

<p>
The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br><br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

<p>
During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

<p>
The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

</p>

<p>
Elder Kim Yong-ki is recognized as one of the most multifaceted figures of practical Christian faith in modern Korean history. His life extended beyond the maturation of personal belief into a devotion toward family, community, and national transformation. Especially in the turbulent 1960s, when South Korea was emerging from the devastation of the Korean War and moving toward industrialization and national reconstruction, Kim became not merely a man of faith but a social reformer who concretely embodied Christian principles in action. At the center of his work was the institutionalization and expansion of the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which became more than a school ‚Äî it was a living model of community restoration and ethical reform.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs background in faith and family shaped his later mission deeply. His father, on his deathbed, left a powerful message that would become Kim‚Äôs lifelong compass: ‚ÄúThe intellectuals of our nation must return to farming. Agriculture is the root of industry, and without reforming our farming economy, we cannot rebuild this nation.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt simply a piece of paternal advice; it became a call to action. Kim returned to the land, choosing a life of sweat and sacrifice, believing that true national revival must begin from the soil. His journey of faith began in earnest during his time at Gwangdong Middle School under Japanese occupation. There, he witnessed the March 1st Independence Movement and experienced firsthand the suffering and humiliation of his people. Through teachers who taught both Korean history and Christian principles, Kim realized that liberation would not come through violence or foreign aid, but through spiritual awakening and moral renewal. Though initially drawn to the idea of resisting Japan through external power (such as China), he eventually rejected such nationalist illusions after a spiritual encounter in Shenyang, returning to Korea with a renewed understanding of faith and mission.
</p>
<p>
Kim‚Äôs household was a model of practical Christianity. It was not only a space for family life but a fully structured faith-based community. Each day began with the ringing of a bell at dawn, followed by prayer and worship, work, and evening reflections. He trained his children in obedience, discipline, and devotion. Meals were shared with hymns, daily labor was integrated with worship, and every action was evaluated in light of one‚Äôs responsibility before God. The home was the prototype for what he envisioned as the ‚ÄúCanaan community‚Äù ‚Äî a place where work was sacred, family was a unit of faith, and life itself became an offering.
</p>
<p>
From this base, Kim expanded his vision through the Canaan Farmers‚Äô School, which he developed in the 1950s and strengthened through the 1960s. It was not merely a training ground for agricultural skills but a holistic space of moral, spiritual, and social formation. His philosophy was built around three Christian values: <em>diligence, service,</em> and <em>sacrifice</em>. Labor, in Kim‚Äôs view, was not just a means of survival but a divine calling. ‚ÄúThose who do not work shall not eat,‚Äù he declared, echoing both biblical teaching and national necessity. This ethic of sweat and humility would soon be echoed at the national level.
</p>
<p>
In 1962, President Park Chung-hee visited the Canaan community, marking a pivotal moment in the school‚Äôs influence. The encounter opened the door for the Canaan movement to serve as a model for South Korea‚Äôs Saemaul Undong (New Village Movement). Kim‚Äôs core values ‚Äî self-help, self-reliance, cooperation ‚Äî were adopted as the official ideological pillars of the Saemaul Movement. His school‚Äôs training programs, methods of collective discipline, and grassroots leadership development were directly integrated into the state-run rural development efforts.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Kim‚Äôs insistence that leaders must first sacrifice, serve, and exemplify moral integrity deeply shaped the character of local Saemaul leaders. For him, leadership was not about command but about service and example. This influenced the way the government trained and deployed its Saemaul leaders: they were to live among the people, work beside them, and lead by example. In essence, the Saemaul Movement‚Äôs community-first and ethics-driven model was a national adaptation of Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs Christian rural reform. Moreover, Kim‚Äôs influence extended to the global stage. The Canaan movement became a model for agricultural and rural development in other developing countries across Asia and Africa. His theology of faith-in-action offered a tangible vision of how Christianity could contribute not only to individual salvation but to the reconstruction of entire communities and nations.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Elder Kim Yong-ki‚Äôs 1960s legacy lies not only in the institutions he built or the movements he inspired, but in the integrated life he lived. His faith was not compartmentalized into church services or private devotion. It shaped his family, his labor, his leadership, and his love for the nation. The Canaan Farmers‚Äô School was not merely a training center; it was a lived theology, a ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô where the gospel was enacted daily through work, order, and mutual responsibility. His model of lay Christian leadership demonstrated that transformative faith need not wait for pulpits or priests. For Kim, a farmer‚Äôs hands, guided by faith and committed to justice, were the very tools of national salvation.

The 1960s marked a significant phase in the ministry of Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, during which his theological vision and practical mission converged in earnest. Moving beyond church growth or individual salvation, Han Kyung-Jik sought to evangelize the entire Korean people and respond to the divided nation‚Äôs humanitarian crisis through faith. His ministry transcended religious confines and left a profound spiritual and social impact on Korean society.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nationwide Evangelization Movement: ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-Jik, alongside Kim Hwal-lan and other leaders, launched the Nationwide Evangelization Movement, the first interdenominational and government-cooperated evangelistic campaign in Korean Protestant history. Unlike previous church-specific evangelistic efforts, this movement sought to evangelize Korean society on a national scale with systemized strategies. A core innovation was the adoption of the Latin American strategy of ‚ÄúEvangelism in Depth‚Äù. Traditionally, evangelism relied on preaching and tract distribution, but this new approach used television, radio, folk songs, theater, and visual arts to penetrate all aspects of life and culture. It emphasized a holistic transformation of individual lives and social values.
</p>
<p>
The campaign‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúThirty Million to Christ‚Äù, was not just rhetorical but expressed Han‚Äôs radical vision to reshape Korea‚Äôs societal fabric upon Christian values. Evangelism, for him, involved not only conversion but transforming hearts and reconstructing the ethical consciousness of a nation plagued by war trauma and moral disintegration. Rev.&nbsp;Han was more than a symbolic figure in this movement; he played a central role in organizing structures, crafting strategies, and rallying churches. His own congregation, Youngnak Presbyterian Church, served as the strategic hub for outreach and community welfare. He promoted the vision of the church as not just a place of worship, but a platform for social renewal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gospel and Nation: Spiritual Revolution and National Reconstruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
Han‚Äôs vision of evangelism extended beyond spiritual awakening to what he called a spiritual revolution. In 1970, marking the 25th anniversary of Youngnak Church, he organized a large-scale Spiritual Revolution Evangelistic Rally with the theme, ‚ÄúBecome a New Person, Build a New Nation‚Äù<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Diagnosing the rise of materialism and moral decay amid Korea‚Äôs rapid economic development, Han argued that the nation needed to repent and be spiritually reborn. Drawing inspiration from John Wesley‚Äôs role in reforming 18th-century England, Han urged Korean Christians to take leadership in national moral renewal through faith. This revolution was a Christian vision of social transformation rooted in repentance, rebirth, and ethical commitment.
</p>
<p>
He envisioned the church as a catalyst for societal ethics and civic renewal, emphasizing that authentic faith must be visible in civic responsibility, honesty, and social justice.

<strong>North Korea: Compassion Beyond the 38th Parallel</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another defining element of Rev.&nbsp;Han‚Äôs ministry during the 1960s was his deepening concern for North Korea and the people left behind after the war. As a native of the North and former pastor in Sinuiju, he harbored a lifelong sense of moral debt toward those he had been forced to leave during the Korean War. This shaped his understanding of the North Korean people not as enemies, but as spiritual siblings in need of compassion and the gospel. His sermons often reflected this duality: condemnation of communist ideology on one hand, and profound empathy for the North Korean populace on the other. He proposed humanitarian efforts such as sending surplus rice to North Korea<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, stressing that faith should transcend political ideologies and act in love. These ideas prefigured the later Christian-led humanitarian efforts in the 1990s. Han‚Äôs approach represented a rare balance between anticommunism and gospel-centered humanitarianism in Korean Christianity. His focus was on non-political, faith-based action ‚Äî advocating civil diplomacy and practical mercy grounded in Christian ethics, rather than ideological antagonism.

The 1960s marked a transformative decade for Rev.&nbsp;Kim Jae-jun, in which he emerged not only as a theologian but also as a public intellectual and activist. He played a pioneering role in leading the Korean Protestant community‚Äôs progressive turn and actively challenged the boundaries between faith and politics, the church and society.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Kim strongly opposed the Park Chung-hee government‚Äôs normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. The agreement, made without a sincere apology or reparations for Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, was in his eyes ‚Äúan insult to history and a dishonest act before God.‚Äù<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared that the church could not remain silent in the face of political injustice, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNormalization with Japan is not reconciliation for the people, but a compromise for the regime.‚Äù<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, in 1969, Kim took the lead as the preparatory chair of the ‚ÄúNational Committee Against the Third-Term Amendment,‚Äù which resisted President Park‚Äôs unconstitutional bid for extended rule. Using the language of Christian ethics, he warned, ‚ÄúThose who alter the constitution for personal gain sin before God. What they trample is not only the people‚Äôs sovereignty but also God‚Äôs justice.‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> His leadership provided moral legitimacy for democratic resistance rooted in faith. Kim also advanced a theological foundation for the social responsibility of the church, criticizing the view that the church‚Äôs sole mission is ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúa retreat from reality.‚Äù<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> He stressed that ‚Äúthe church must declare God‚Äôs will through political criticism, active engagement, support for the best possible alternatives, and the proposal of ideal political forms.‚Äù<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This theology later inspired the rise of minjung theology and the ecumenical movements of the 1970s and 1980s, led by his disciples.

During the 1960s, Jang Jun-ha stood as a quintessential example of a Christian who integrated his faith with the practice of democracy. He was not merely a politician or journalist, but a public intellectual and a moral voice deeply rooted in Christian convictions. Educated in theology at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary and later at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Korea, he did not pursue ordination, yet his life was remembered as embodying a ‚ÄúChristian martyr spirit.‚Äù During his time in the Korean Liberation Army, he was called ‚ÄúPastor Jang‚Äù by fellow soldiers, highlighting the strong religious identity that remained evident throughout his life. Central to his work was a Christian ethic grounded in justice, human dignity, and freedom.
</p>
<p>
These values were most explicitly expressed through the monthly magazine <em>Sasanggye</em> (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÍ≥Ñ), which Jang founded and edited. <em>Sasanggye</em> was not simply a venue for intellectual discourse; it served as Jang‚Äôs spiritual platform for implementing Christian ideals in society. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe are now at a point where the freedom and civil rights that Sasanggye has nurtured and upheld by devoting the entirety of its destiny and its members are now caught in violent waves both within and without, facing a shipwreck‚Ä¶ At this moment, we believe the time has come to renew our resolution and prepare for a new battle line for the freedom and civil rights of this land.‚Äù<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This statement reflects the gravity of <em>Sasanggye</em>‚Äôs role as more than a publication‚Äîit was an act of Christian witness and civic resistance in the face of authoritarianism. Throughout this decade, Jang aligned himself with progressive Christian circles resisting the Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs oppressive measures. He upheld the view that the defense of civil liberties, the press, and human dignity stemmed from Christian principles. He once stated, ‚ÄúPolitical freedom is a basic right in itself, but even more crucial as a means to secure a greater national freedom.‚Äù<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Here, democracy was not only a political necessity but a spiritual and ethical imperative.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Korean Protestantism was generally divided into three groups: a conservative minority that collaborated with the regime, a centrist majority that alternated between resistance and cooperation, and a small, progressive minority that actively resisted. Jang was a leading figure among the latter. He called for the church to reclaim its prophetic role, stating that ‚Äúif the church cannot fulfill its mission, it might as well close its doors.‚Äù He worked closely with Christian intellectuals and civil rights leaders to promote democracy and public justice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
For Jang, these efforts were not merely political acts but faith-based commitments. He firmly believed that Christians could not confine their faith to the four walls of the church. Instead, he maintained that believers must confront injustice, guided by conscience and justice. This conviction remained unshaken even as <em>Sasanggye</em> was forcibly shut down in 1974 under the Yushin dictatorship. Until the end, Jang sought to preserve the magazine as a ‚Äúmouthpiece of the people,‚Äù demonstrating a legacy that continues to challenge Christians today to reflect on the public dimension of faith.

The 1960s marked a turning point for Ham Seok-heon as both a thinker and an engaged intellectual. Following the April 19 Revolution of 1960, he supported the nonviolent uprising but sharply criticized the failure of the Second Republic and the emergence of the military regime. In response to the turbulent political situation, he placed the concepts of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and ‚ÄúSsi‚Äôal‚Äù at the center of his intellectual resistance.
</p>
<p>
For Ham, the essence of democracy was not found in procedural or institutional frameworks, but rather in the awakening and active participation of the people. He did not see the people as passive recipients of governance or mere instruments of political mobilization, but as historical agents capable of realizing democracy. However, he believed that the people did not naturally become political subjects; instead, intellectuals had the responsibility to awaken them. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe people needed to be enlightened by intellectuals. In this sense, Ham‚Äôs theory of democracy emphasized the role of intellectuals more than the existence of the people themselves.‚Äù<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This concept of the people was further elaborated through Ham‚Äôs distinctive philosophy of <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>. He stated, ‚ÄúHe found <em>Ssi‚Äôal-ness</em> in resistance against ruling power. For him, ‚Äòresistance‚Äô was simultaneously the individual‚Äôs process of self-revolution and the formation of the people as a collective.‚Äù<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> are not those who conform to external authorities, but those who follow an inner truth‚Äîseeds of transformation for society. This idea went beyond an ontological concept and was imagined as a metaphor for a national subject rooted in a history of suffering. When President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs administration pushed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1964, Ham strongly opposed the move, criticizing the absence of historical reflection or apology. He proclaimed, ‚ÄúRather than asking what we can receive from Japan, we must first ask what Japan has taken from us.‚Äù<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This perspective revealed that his nationalism was not exclusionary but rooted in ethics, justice, and self-respect. It also connected with his cosmopolitan sensibility.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Ham‚Äôs spiritual journey extended beyond non-church Christianity (<em>mugyohoe</em>) as he embraced Quakerism and religious pluralism. He confessed, ‚ÄúFor me, Christianity is no longer the only true religion, and the Bible is not the sole perfect truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> He drew inspiration from Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, and Confucianism, in search of universal truth. His philosophy of nonviolence and peace, influenced by Gandhi and Quaker traditions, made him known as a ‚Äúmilitant pacifist.‚Äù<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His discourse on democracy diverged from that of mainstream dissident intellectuals of the 1960s and 70s. ‚ÄúAlthough he criticized the Park regime and the Yushin system in the name of freedom and democracy, his discourse differed from the typical liberal democratic discourse of the time.‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> While many intellectuals called for a return to pre-Yushin constitutionalism, Ham instead advocated for ‚Äúliberal democracy through the political subjectification of the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em>.‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, Ham‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely about resisting dictatorship‚Äîit was a period of philosophical creation. He understood democracy not simply as a matter of institutional arrangements but as a way of life rooted in human dignity. He sought an alternative value system in response to materialism and rapid industrialization, offering a vision of social transformation grounded in the <em>Ssi‚Äôal</em> philosophy. His thought continues to provide a rich resource for contemporary debates on democracy, freedom, and the ethical role of the intellectual.

Rev.&nbsp;George E. Ogle (Korean name: Oh Myung-gul) was dispatched to Korea in 1954 as a Methodist missionary from the United States. During the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the 1960s, he committed himself to advocating for workers‚Äô rights and welfare through a new model of urban industrial mission. Born in 1929 in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town, Ogle witnessed firsthand the lives of working-class families. He studied at Maryville College and Duke Divinity School, where he was deeply influenced by teachings on labor issues and economic justice. These experiences led him to the conviction that ‚Äúthe gospel cannot remain confined within church walls‚Äîit must go into the factories, the streets, and the lives of the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1961, his work with the Incheon Industrial Evangelism Committee (later Incheon Urban Industrial Mission) diverged significantly from traditional missionary practices. At the time, industrial evangelism in Korea usually relied on cooperation with factory owners to reach workers. In contrast, Ogle challenged this top-down approach and practiced a grassroots ministry by living among laborers in Incheon‚Äôs poor neighborhoods and building relationships directly with them. He would visit factories during lunch breaks, introduce himself, and pray for workers injured on the job‚Äîgestures that gradually earned their trust.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Influenced by the French ‚ÄúWorker-Priest‚Äù movement, Ogle believed that pastors should engage in physical labor alongside workers. He introduced a ‚Äúworking clergy‚Äù program, sending seminary students and pastors into factories to share workers‚Äô experiences. Before sending Pastor Jo Hwa-soon to work at the Dongil Textile factory, he instructed her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there thinking you‚Äôre going to evangelize. Go with the mindset of learning from the workers.‚Äù<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ogle‚Äôs mission extended far beyond traditional religious outreach. He emphasized workers‚Äô organization and political awareness, insisting that ‚Äúdemocracy must be realized in the workplace, and workers must become agents and subjects of that democracy.‚Äù<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The Incheon mission team organized legal education sessions on labor rights and unions, launched women‚Äôs labor groups, and developed leadership training programs for lay workers. These efforts laid the groundwork for the later emergence of democratic labor unions and progressive worker movements in Korea. However, Ogle‚Äôs activism soon drew the attention of the authoritarian Park Chung Hee regime. In 1974, after he held a prayer meeting for those wrongfully sentenced in the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Revolutionary Party Incident,‚Äù he was accused of violating national security and deported. As he was boarding the plane, a young flight attendant quietly handed him a postcard. It read: ‚ÄúRev. Ogle, farewell‚Ä¶ Most of us know that you worked for our country‚Äôs true freedom and democracy‚Ä¶ Your name will remain in history.‚Äù<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle‚Äôs work was more than religious ministry‚Äîit was a profound commitment to human dignity, democracy, and solidarity with the marginalized. His theology informed the emergence of Korean minjung theology and inspired future generations of Christians to practice social engagement and advocacy for justice.

During the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo was more than just a surgeon in Korea‚Äôs medical field; he became a symbolic figure of gospel-based love and justice, especially for the poor and socially vulnerable. During the Korean War in 1950, he fled to the South with only his second son, leaving behind his wife and children in the North. From that moment on, he lived with deep sorrow but unwaveringly pursued what he considered a divine calling: <em>‚Äúto serve as a doctor for patients who cannot receive care due to lack of money.‚Äù</em> This calling stemmed from his Christian faith. Before enrolling in Kyungsung Medical School, he vowed to God that <em>‚Äúhe would dedicate his life to those who die without ever seeing a doctor‚Äù</em>‚Äîa vow that became the spiritual foundation of his life and career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Entering the 1960s, Dr.&nbsp;Jang was a professor at Pusan National University College of Medicine and the director of Gospel Hospital, where he began seriously considering systemic solutions for the medical needs of the poor. As a devout Christian, he led a weekly Bible study group called the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù which was not just for biblical study but also for discussing and enacting social transformation based on Christian values. It was from this group that the Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (Cheongsipja) was born. Dr.&nbsp;Jang recalled, ‚ÄúI had long envisioned solving the treatment problem through medical insurance, but had given up due to lack of collaborators.‚Äù<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This statement shows that his vision was not a sudden inspiration, but something he had been prayerfully preparing for years.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Insurance Union (hereafter, the Blue Cross) was established in 1968‚Äîwell before the Korean government had implemented a nationwide health insurance system. The Union was initiated by Christians and operated as a non-profit, member-based cooperative to provide low-cost medical care to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù was selected partly for its neutrality and partly because it echoed the ethos of the American ‚ÄúBlue Cross‚Äù system. Although it was born out of Christian convictions, the name was chosen to include non-Christians as well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The Blue Cross was deeply infused with gospel values. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly framed the project in theological terms, stating that ‚Äúlove for one‚Äôs neighbor‚Äù could be understood as a form of ‚Äúcooperative spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> This was not merely metaphorical‚ÄîChristian theology shaped the Union‚Äôs policies and operations. Its charter declared the Union to be non-profit, open to all, and governed by democratic principles. Its structure closely mirrored the early Christian church community described in Acts 2, where believers shared their possessions and cared for one another as a spiritual family. Most of the founding members were Christians, and numerous local churches supported the movement financially and through participation.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross was also Korea‚Äôs first civilian medical insurance organization and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for Korea‚Äôs eventual National Health Insurance System. It not only filled the gaps left by the government during the 1960s and 70s, but also provided operational data, statistics, and tested models that were later referenced by the state in building universal health coverage. In this way, Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs work transcended hospital management‚Äîit became a model of faith-driven social reform.
</p>
<p>
His life consistently displayed this Christian spirituality. He practiced voluntary poverty, giving nearly all of his income to the poor. Even after a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he continued to visit the hospital to care for patients. Although he received numerous awards‚Äîincluding the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Order of National Service Merit, and the Ho-Am Prize‚Äîhe often humbly said, ‚ÄúI am a fool. I gave everything to my neighbors and kept nothing for myself.‚Äù Dr.&nbsp;Jang‚Äôs activities in the 1960s and his work through the Blue Cross show that he was not merely a ‚Äúgood doctor,‚Äù but rather a practitioner of the gospel, seeking to make the Kingdom of God visible in social structures. His faith did not stop at personal piety or ecclesiastical service; it was prophetic, incarnational, and socially engaged, as he stood in solidarity with the suffering and enacted justice and mercy through the language of public health and community organization.

<p>
07/07/1885 ~ 06/07/1972<br> <br> Seo Byung-ho (Âæê‰∏ôÊµ©, 1885‚Äì1972) was a prominent Korean independence activist and educator whose life spanned the late Joseon period, the Japanese colonial era, and post-liberation Korea. Born in Jangyeon, Hwanghae Province, he was the second son of Seo Gyeong-jo, one of the first ordained Presbyterian ministers in Korea. Seo Byung-ho is also recorded as the first child in Korea to receive infant baptism. After graduating from Kyungshin School, he taught at various institutions, including Hae-seo First School‚Äîfounded by his father‚Äîand Daeseong School, established by Ahn Chang-ho, thus actively engaging in the enlightenment movement of the early 20th century. In 1914, he enrolled at Jinling University in Nanjing, China, where he developed a Christian worldview and a cosmopolitan outlook, both of which laid the ideological groundwork for his later involvement in the independence movement and humanitarian work through the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
During his years in Shanghai, Seo became involved in key nationalist organizations such as the Tongji Association and the New Korea Youth Party (Shinhan Cheongnyeondang). He formed close relationships with influential figures like Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hyung, contributing to the organizational structure of the overseas independence movement. After the March 1st Movement of 1919, he returned to Shanghai, where he served as the Director of the Ministry of Interior and a member of the Provisional Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It was during this time that he played a critical role in reorganizing and leading the Korean Red Cross under the Provisional Government, eventually serving as its chair.
</p>
<p>
The Korean Red Cross, under Seo‚Äôs leadership, was more than a relief organization. It operated as an essential arm of the independence movement, treating wounded independence fighters, supporting the families of martyrs, and training medical and nursing personnel. As chair, Seo established a comprehensive support system for the independence struggle, founding hospitals and creating a nursing school in Shanghai. He expanded the Red Cross into an international network with branches in Hawaii, mainland U.S., and Mexico<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. This vision reflected his Christian humanitarian convictions, which saw faith as an actionable commitment to the suffering and oppressed.
</p>
<p>
Seo once stated, <em>‚ÄúChrist is the perfect person, and I strive to attain that perfection,‚Äù</em> emphasizing that faith was not merely about internal discipline or doctrinal belief but a moral force driving one to serve the greater good<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. His work with the Red Cross embodied this ethos, and the organization‚Äîunder his guidance‚Äîemerged as one of the most systematically operated relief institutions within the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
After Korea‚Äôs liberation, Seo returned and served as principal and board chair of Kyungshin Academy, contributing to the rebuilding of education in the new republic. As an elder at Saemunan Presbyterian Church, he continued to serve as a spiritual and civic leader. During the Korean War, he chaired the Emergency Response Committee of the Korean YMCA in Busan, where he coordinated aid for refugees and youth welfare programs.
</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, Seo reemerged as a moral voice during a critical period in Korea‚Äôs political history. In 1964, as the Park Chung-hee regime pursued normalization talks with Japan, Seo joined former President Yun Posun, Kim Hong-il, and Christian thinker Ham Seok-heon in opposing what they viewed as humiliating diplomacy. Despite being over 80 years old, Seo publicly participated in protests as part of a broader Christian and civic coalition. That same year, he was honored at a commemorative event at Seoul Citizens Hall celebrating the leaders of the March 1st Movement<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Seo‚Äôs activism was not confined to historical memory. It extended into ongoing struggles for democracy, justice, and national sovereignty. For him, Christianity was not only a path to personal salvation but a call to public service. Through his life, Seo exemplified what it meant to be a Christian intellectual and a public servant, whose faith manifested in both words and deeds. He remains a model of Christian civic engagement in Korea‚Äôs modern history.

During the 1960s, Rev.&nbsp;Hyung-kyu Park‚Äôs activities marked a pivotal turning point in both the Korean Christian social participation movement and the democratization movement. During this period, Park expanded the role of the pastor beyond the church walls, embracing social justice and the restoration of democracy as essential components of faithful practice.
</p>
<p>
The April 19 Revolution of 1960 was a transformative experience for Park. Witnessing the sight of students bleeding during the protest, he recalled the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross. This event led him to deep repentance, both personally and on behalf of the Korean church for its silence under authoritarian rule. In his memoir, he writes: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the students bleeding as they were carried on stretchers, I felt as though something struck my head violently. In them, I saw the image of Jesus bleeding on the cross.‚Äù He goes on to state, ‚ÄúI vowed to devote my life not to a ministry centered on prosperity, but to the task of making the church truly the church, as Karl Barth called for.‚Äù<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Following this event, Park began to speak more directly on social and political issues. Emphasizing the Christian responsibility to oppose injustice, he declared, ‚ÄúTo achieve a welfare society, the church must boldly stand with the oppressed and the abandoned, resisting injustice and bearing the cross.‚Äù<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> From a gospel-centered perspective, he advocated for the promotion of democratic values and the pursuit of social justice, beginning with democratization within the church community itself. He underscored the importance of ‚Äúchurch democratization‚Äù and the growth of Christians as mature democratic citizens.
</p>
<p>
The anti-ratification movement against the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty was a major milestone for Korean Christianity‚Äôs engagement in political discourse. At the time, Park joined Kim Jae-jun, Han Kyung-jik, and other church leaders in issuing a public statement titled ‚ÄúOur View on the Normalization of Korea-Japan Relations,‚Äù with over 200 Christian leaders co-signing. This marked a historic moment in Korean church history when the church collectively began to make political declarations.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1969, Park actively opposed President Park Chung-hee‚Äôs attempt to amend the constitution for a third presidential term. As the planning director for the ‚ÄúNational Coalition Against the Third Term Amendment,‚Äù he sharply criticized the regime in <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, writing, ‚ÄúThe Korean church can no longer avoid confronting the forces of darkness.‚Äù He proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe forces of darkness are rising again. It is time for the children of light to put on the full armor of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> From this point forward, Park transitioned from a critic to an active participant in resistance. Simultaneously, Park dedicated himself to student movements. Upon his appointment as general secretary of the Korean Student Christian Movement (KSCM) in 1966, he sought to instill in Christian students a sense of responsibility for society and democracy. At a 1967 national lecture series titled ‚ÄúThe Growth of Korean Democracy and the Presence of the Christian,‚Äù he asserted that ‚Äúthe presence of Christians‚Äù meant active participation in society, following the example of Christ who stood with the poor and the powerless.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1969, he facilitated the merger of KSCM and the YMCA Student Division, launching the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF). Under the slogan ‚ÄúGo to the people, Look at the people, Act with the people,‚Äù the KSCF established the Student Social Development Corps (SSDC), a program promoting practical fieldwork in slum communities and factories. Around the same time, Park became the editor-in-chief of <em>Christian Thought</em> magazine, transforming it from a publication serving pastors into a public intellectual platform that addressed pressing social issues. He broadened the magazine‚Äôs focus to include urban poverty, labor rights, and the authoritarian government. With contributors from outside the church, such as journalists and scholars, the magazine became a space for critical engagement with theology and society.‚Å∂<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, Park also engaged in urban ministry, particularly among the urban poor. He helped establish the Urban Mission Committee and launched training programs for community organizers. Residents of Seoul‚Äôs shantytowns, supported by Park‚Äôs team, began organizing to demand improvements in housing and infrastructure. Park emphasized human dignity and equality, stating, ‚ÄúNational modernization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to the realization of human fulfillment and liberation.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In summary, the 1960s were a time of transformation for Rev. Hyung-kyu Park, as he evolved from a traditional pastor into a prophetic voice within Korean society. Grounded in Christian faith, his work in democratization, student activism, and urban missions laid the foundation for his continued leadership in the 1970s and beyond. His legacy exemplifies a theology lived out through action‚Äîa church truly becoming the church in the world.

The ministry of Pastor Yonggi Cho in the 1960s must be understood within the historical and theological context of Korea‚Äôs post-war reconstruction, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of military regimes. During this period of great social upheaval, Cho introduced a new model of Pentecostal Christianity that resonated deeply with the urban poor and migrants, offering what he called ‚Äúhope in the midst of despair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Cho‚Äôs ministry began in 1958 when he founded a tent church in Daejo-dong with his ministry partner and future mother-in-law, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi. In the early 1960s, they relocated the church to Seodaemun, a more central district in Seoul. As part of the Assemblies of God‚Äôs urban-focused missionary strategy, Cho was appointed to lead the newly established evangelism center there, where he began to attract large numbers of followers. Eventually, in 1973, the church moved to Yeouido, an undeveloped area at the time but one destined to become a political and economic hub of Seoul. According to historian Park Myung Soo, ‚ÄúThe movement of Yoido Full Gospel Church from the outskirts of Bulkwang-dong to Yeouido mirrored the church‚Äôs journey from the periphery to the center of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite this remarkable growth, Cho and his ministry faced significant resistance from Korea‚Äôs mainstream denominations, particularly the Presbyterian Church. In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap) declared that it would suspend all cooperative activities with Yoido Full Gospel Church, citing theological concerns such as glossolalia, divine healing, and the relationship between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and salvation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Yet Cho‚Äôs message had already gained widespread popularity. ‚ÄúHe understood what the masses of Korean Christians desired, and he used magazines, newspapers, and broadcasting media to disseminate that message,‚Äù Park notes.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs sermons were distinctive in their rejection of traditional otherworldly preaching. Instead, he emphasized how to ‚Äúenjoy God‚Äôs blessings in the here and now,‚Äù giving hope and vision to impoverished and suffering audiences.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> His ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù message‚Äîsalvation, physical healing, and material prosperity‚Äîspoke directly to the needs of a society recovering from war and struggling with poverty and inequality.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Pentecostal groups that neglected theological training, Cho established the International Theological Institute and actively invited domestic and international scholars to help systematize Pentecostal theology.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This intellectual initiative was instrumental in overcoming sectarian boundaries. In 1994, the Presbyterian Church eventually acknowledged that ‚Äúdifferences in doctrine were based on interpretative variations among denominations rather than fundamental heresy.‚Äù<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Cho‚Äôs theology was not only doctrinal but experiential. Through the establishment of the Osanri Prayer Mountain, his church created a national spiritual hub where Christians from all denominations‚ÄîPresbyterian, Methodist, Holiness, and Baptist‚Äîgathered to fast, speak in tongues, and experience healing. Park describes Osanri as ‚Äúa space where desperate prayers and dramatic spiritual encounters shaped the testimony culture of Korean Christianity.‚Äù<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
It is also crucial to understand that Cho did not build the church alone. His mother-in-law and ministry partner, Pastor Ja-Shil Choi, played a foundational role in the early stages of the church. ‚ÄúIf Pastor Choi had not become my partner, I would not have been able to fulfill my pastoral mission,‚Äù Cho once wrote.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Choi managed finances, evangelism, administration, and intercession, while Cho focused on preaching. Their partnership was not merely organizational but spiritual and familial, forming what Park calls a ‚Äúgendered division of spiritual labor‚Äù in early Korean Pentecostalism.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Pastor Yonggi Cho‚Äôs ministry in the 1960s was not just about growing a megachurch. It marked a profound transformation in Korean Protestantism, bringing Pentecostal spirituality from the margins to the center. Cho offered a faith that was not only emotional and experiential but also strategic and theologically engaged. His work shaped a generation of Korean Christians and redefined what it meant to be ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù in Korea‚Äôs modern religious landscape.

Jang Myeon (John Chang, 1899‚Äì1966) was a rare example of a statesman deeply rooted in Christian faith who played pivotal roles at critical turning points in modern Korean history. From the Japanese colonial period through national liberation and the establishment of the Second Republic in the 1960s, Jang‚Äôs life was marked by a consistent commitment to religious principles and public service. He received infant baptism shortly after birth and lived his entire life as a devout Catholic. As one scholar noted, ‚ÄúHe was a ‚ÄòCatholic politician‚Äô who sought to act according to Christian principles‚Äù even after entering political life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Before his political career, Jang had already established himself as an educator and lay religious leader. While studying at Suwon Agricultural School, he engaged in a theological dispute with a Protestant student that left a lasting impact on him. Determined to study Catholic doctrine more deeply, he went to the United States with support from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, studying education, philosophy, and theology at Manhattan College.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Upon returning to Korea in 1925, he assisted Maryknoll missionaries in Pyongyang by teaching Korean language and customs, training catechists, and translating catechetical texts. His first major translation was <em>The Faith of Our Fathers</em>, which he chose, as he put it, because ‚Äúit became urgently clear that a robust apologetic text was needed to clarify the truth between the two faiths.‚Äù<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This background laid the foundation for his political engagement following Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945. He was appointed a member of the U.S. military government‚Äôs advisory Democratic Council in 1946, declaring that ‚Äúthe foremost task of our people is the complete independence of the nation in politics, self-reliance in economics, and the strengthening of education and culture.‚Äù<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1948, he contributed to Korea‚Äôs first constitution and introduced a provision on ‚Äúthe sanctity and protection of marriage‚Äù to eliminate concubinage and strengthen women‚Äôs rights. He later reflected, ‚ÄúThis clause established a moral basis that helped end socially accepted polygamy and promoted a healthy society and family.‚Äù<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The 1950s marked Jang‚Äôs rise on the international stage. As Korea‚Äôs first ambassador to the United States, he secured military and economic aid following the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1948, as head of the Korean delegation to the 3rd UN General Assembly, he successfully led the diplomatic campaign to gain formal UN recognition of the Republic of Korea. Recalling that moment, he wrote, ‚ÄúAfter working tirelessly day and night, the UN officially recognized our government with a sweeping vote of 48 to 6. It was a moment of indescribable joy.‚Äù<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This trajectory culminated in 1960, when Jang became Prime Minister and head of government under Korea‚Äôs newly formed parliamentary system. Following the April 19 Revolution, the Second Republic was established to dismantle the authoritarian presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. Jang, seeing politics as ‚Äúan extension of faith and a service to the people,‚Äù spearheaded a series of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, release of political prisoners, and the push for local autonomy.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> However, the fledgling republic struggled amid internal divisions, external Cold War pressures, and growing distrust from the military and conservative elites. It was abruptly ended by the military coup of May 16, 1961, which forced Jang into retirement. After his ousting, Jang lived a quiet, reflective life. Though branded a ‚Äúformer politician,‚Äù he continued to contemplate the relationship between faith and politics. In his later writings, he affirmed, ‚ÄúPolitics is the work of God to realize human freedom and dignity, and the people are the flock of God.‚Äù<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Jang‚Äôs role in the 1960s should not be dismissed merely as a failed experiment of parliamentary democracy. Rather, it stands as a rare and valuable example of the integration of faith-based ethics and democratic governance in Korean history. He consistently prioritized conscience over power and exemplified what it meant to serve the public as a Christian statesman. His life is a testament to how religious conviction can meaningfully shape public life and contribute to the pursuit of justice, peace, and democratic values.

YWCA
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1960s was a period in South Korea shaped by authoritarian nationalism and rapid industrialization, following the military coup led by Park Chung-hee in 1961. During this time, women were primarily regarded as tools of ‚Äúnational reconstruction‚Äù and ‚Äúmodernization,‚Äù seen less as political or economic agents and more as guardians of domestic order and state-directed consumption. Within this context, the Korean YWCA did not passively follow government initiatives but actively engaged in a Christian-based civic movement. It emphasized women‚Äôs self-awareness, education, vocational development, and civic participation, distinguishing itself as an independent actor in civil society. The YWCA‚Äôs concrete efforts in women‚Äôs social education, consumer rights activism, job training, and international networking made it one of the most dynamic women‚Äôs organizations in the country.
</p>
<p>
One of its most prominent initiatives was the establishment of a Women‚Äôs Center in Namsan, Seoul, in 1963, which served as a base for various social education programs. These included vocational training in sewing, cooking, and cosmetology, as well as civic education on budgeting, legal literacy (especially family law), and consumer responsibility. A particularly notable project was the campaign to encourage marriage registration among women. This was a pioneering legal rights education initiative designed to protect wives‚Äô legal status, especially in cases of abandonment or informal divorce. The campaign framed women not just as passive dependents but as legal subjects capable of asserting their rights in a modern legal system.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1965, the YWCA hosted a national conference under the theme ‚ÄúThe Housewife‚Äôs Thrift as the Foundation of National Resources,‚Äù promoting food conservation, support for domestic products, and the fight against price collusion and unsafe consumer goods. The organization‚Äôs reporting of unfair pricing practices in beauty salons and its campaigns for food safety marked an early consumer rights movement led by women. Significantly, the YWCA did not merely promote state policies on thrift but advanced a critical vision of women as ‚Äúconsumer citizens,‚Äù capable of ethical and collective decision-making.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> Such initiatives were not merely economic but ideological interventions that reframed women as agents of citizenship. While the state attempted to mobilize women‚Äôs organizations into politically neutral and state-compliant roles, the YWCA maintained a delicate balance between cooperation and independence. For instance, in 1966, Mokpo YWCA‚Äôs founder Choi Chan-yeol was awarded the Yongsin Prize for her exemplary social service, illustrating the moral legitimacy of voluntary, community-based Christian service that transcended state co-optation.¬≥<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The YWCA also strengthened its international presence during the 1960s. While the Park regime utilized women‚Äôs groups to improve its international image, the YWCA leveraged this opportunity to deepen ties with global movements such as the World YWCA and the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF). Notable figures like Kim Hwal-lan and Lee Sook-jung, key actors in both national and international Christian women‚Äôs networks, represented Korean women at global conferences. These engagements became platforms for introducing the Korean women‚Äôs movement to the world and situating it within a broader Christian human rights framework.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> Nevertheless, the YWCA also encountered tension with the government. In 1965, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs attempted to reclaim the Namsan Women‚Äôs Center building, arguing it would be repurposed for broader access. The YWCA protested, revealing that the space was in fact reassigned for male officials‚Äô meetings and government events, criticizing the decision as undermining women‚Äôs organizing.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> This conflict reflects the ongoing <strong>negotiation</strong> between state control and civil society autonomy, in which the YWCA often operated on contested terrain.
</p>
<p>
The Korean YWCA‚Äôs work in the 1960s was not merely a reaction to state-led modernization, but a faith-based civic engagement grounded in a holistic vision of women‚Äôs spiritual and societal growth. Its emphasis on self-education, community service, legal rights, and democratic homemaking fostered a new model of Christian womanhood that was active, ethical, and publicly engaged. Far from being a passive partner in national development, the YWCA cultivated the foundation for later feminist activism in the 1970s by modeling alternative paths to female empowerment under an authoritarian regime.

<p>
Korean Student Christian Council
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Korean Student Christian Council (KSCC), active from 1959 to 1969, played a pivotal role in systematically unifying the fragmented post-liberation Christian student movements in South Korea and connecting them with the global ecumenical movement. Far beyond functioning as a cooperative council among various Christian student organizations, KSCC served as the institutional and ideological incubator for democratization efforts and socially engaged Christian activism in the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
KSCC was established following a proposal in October 1955 by U Kyaw Than, then Asian Secretary of the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF), during his visit to Korea. He recommended the unification of the three existing Christian student groups‚Äîthe college YMCA, college YWCA, and the Korea Student Christian Movement (KSCM). In July 1959, the three organizations formally launched KSCC as a collaborative body to facilitate this integration process.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> In a 1959 roundtable discussion in <em>Christian Thought</em>, theologian Kang Won-yong described the earlier Korean Christian student movement as ‚Äúunmatched in its vitality globally,‚Äù but also noted its recent stagnation. ‚ÄúIn the past, the movement did not flourish because it was well-led from above, but because students in each campus actively organized and took initiative themselves‚Ä¶ Now, those students have entered a period of dormancy,‚Äù he observed.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> To overcome this stagnation, KSCC initiated the Leadership Motivation for Change (LMC) program in major cities like Seoul, Daegu, and Gwangju beginning in 1960. This program included both Bible study and critical engagement with contemporary issues‚Äîsuch as nationalism, democracy, communism, and secularism‚Äîvia weekly three-hour sessions held at the Jensen Memorial Hall. Professors and pastors such as Han Bae-ho (Korea University), Kim Dong-soo (Sungkwang Church), and Hyun Young-hak (Ewha Womans University) served as lecturers.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
At the 1961 KSCC Executive Committee meeting, 103 students participated, including 26 from KSCM, 40 from the YMCA, and 37 from the YWCA. James T. Laney, an American Methodist missionary and theologian teaching at Yonsei University, delivered a keynote titled ‚ÄúNew Issues in Community Development,‚Äù while notable scholars such as Kim Hyung-seok, Ryu Tong-shik, Chang Chun-ha, and Kang Won-yong also contributed.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> Laney also introduced an innovative Bible study curriculum titled <em>The Calling of the Christian Student</em>, combining scripture with discussion on issues such as Korea-Japan normalization, the widening gap between rich and poor, and industrialization. According to records, ‚ÄúThis meeting included discussions on Korea-Japan relations, the inequalities brought about by industrialization, and a variety of political and social issues.‚Äù<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> KSCC also organized nationwide training programs that emphasized social responsibility as intrinsic to the Christian faith. Their understanding of the gospel moved beyond private salvation to include a call for humanization and social justice. Students were sent into urban slums, rural communities, and industrial sites for field surveys, relief activities, and service projects. These efforts laid the foundation for what would later be known as the Student Social Development Corps (<em>Haksa-dan</em>). Although officially launched in the 1970s, the origins of this movement trace directly back to KSCC activities in 1968‚Äì1969. In 1968, KSCC co-hosted an ecumenical policy consultation with the National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC), resulting in a resolution affirming the ‚Äúsupport and strengthening of a unified student movement.‚Äù<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> During the summer of 1968, approximately 500 students from eight cities participated in pilot Haksa-dan activities, forming small teams of five to eight members who lived and worked among the poor. Their slogan, ‚ÄúRenew Korea,‚Äù became symbolic of both their mission and the theological vision that shaped their activism.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In sum, KSCC should not be seen as a mere collaborative council but as a transformative platform that reshaped the identity and direction of the Korean Christian student movement. It established a practice of integrating faith with public life, grounded the Christian message in democratic and human rights discourse, and bridged the local realities of Korea with global ecumenical thought. Though KSCC formally dissolved in 1970 with the formation of the Korea Student Christian Federation (KSCF), its vision and legacy continued in subsequent rural mission work, urban poor advocacy, and democratization struggles throughout the 1970s and beyond.

<p>
Korean Association of Christian Professors (KACP) Í∏∞ÎèÖÍµêÍµêÏàòÏûêÌòëÌöå
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
During the 1960s, the Korean Association of Christian Professors (KACP) emerged as a representative body of Protestant intellectuals in post-revolution South Korea. More than a scholarly society, this group sought to integrate Christian faith with academic inquiry and actively explored sociopolitical engagement. Its efforts laid the groundwork for subsequent movements for democracy and social justice. The KACP developed amid theological and political debates within the Korean Protestant community, including the ecumenical movement, the question of church-state separation, and the theological legitimacy of social engagement. The association was informally organized in 1957 by professors involved in Christian student movements and was formally established in 1966.
</p>
<p>
A major area of activity for the KACP was its organizational guidance of Christian student movements. Through its collaboration with the Korean Student Christian Council (KSCC, 1959) and the Korean Student Christian Federation (KSCF, from 1968), KACP members provided ideological direction and facilitated leadership development through seminars and academic conferences. Leading figures such as Kim Chun-bae, Kim Sung-sik, and Hyun Young-hak delivered lectures on topics like ‚ÄúChristian Faith and Scholarship‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristian Witness in the University,‚Äù addressing the role of faith in academic life and society. These professors saw the university not merely as a mission field, but as a space for the authentic embodiment of faith. Kim Sung-sik asserted in an article for <em>Kidokgyo Sasang</em> (Christian Thought) that ‚Äúa Christian is a social being, with a responsibility to testify to truth in the realms of politics and history,‚Äù emphasizing that Christian intellectuals must not separate faith from public life.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Behind this activity was the theological vision of Kim Jae-jun, who provided the foundational thinking for the association‚Äôs engagement with society. He argued that the gospel does not permit silence in the face of injustice but demands action on behalf of righteousness.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> While not directly organizing KACP events, Kim deeply influenced both students and professors. He challenged the notion of political neutrality, asking pointedly, ‚ÄúCan one live even a single day without being involved in politics?‚Äù<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> For Kim, to avoid public responsibility was a form of hypocrisy incompatible with authentic faith. Another central figure, Pastor Park Hyung-kyu, was active both in the KACP and as a student movement leader within the YMCA. He declared that ‚Äúthe sons of light must put on the full armor of God and confront the powers of darkness,‚Äù invoking Korea‚Äôs legacy of Christian resistance against imperialism and war as a mandate to resist authoritarianism once more.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> He later founded Galilee Church and expanded his ministry into urban missions and poverty advocacy, becoming a key link between student activism and labor movements during the Yushin regime. KACP‚Äôs activities in the 1960s thus extended far beyond theological seminars or campus religious life. The association sought to develop a Christian intellectual response to South Korea‚Äôs modernization, industrialization, and division. Influenced by the global ecumenical movement, KACP members considered what it meant to be ‚Äúthe church in the world,‚Äù forming a foundation for more radical Christian movements of the 1970s such as the Urban Industrial Mission and the 1973 Declaration for National Salvation.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the KACP of the 1960s serves as a significant example of how Christian conscience and public action intersected during a critical period in Korean modern history. Through its intellectual, theological, and activist legacy, the association played a crucial role in shaping the Christian contributions to South Korea‚Äôs pro-democracy movement.

During the 1960s, South Korea underwent rapid industrialization, and this period saw the emergence of critical issues such as urban poverty and labor exploitation. The Park Chung Hee regime‚Äôs Five-Year Economic Development Plans aimed to modernize the nation but simultaneously entrenched a system where urban workers, often recent migrants from rural areas, had little to no rights or protections. In this historical context, the Urban Industrial Mission (UIM) arose as a Protestant movement that sought to respond to structural injustices and to practice the gospel in the midst of industrial society.
</p>
<p>
The Youngdeungpo Urban Industrial Mission, established in 1958 under the Evangelism Department of the Presbyterian Church (Tonghap), began operating in Seoul‚Äôs Youngdeungpo area, which had become the country‚Äôs largest industrial zone. This region had transformed into a major industrial site since the 1930s due to Japan‚Äôs colonial industrialization policies and had further developed after the Korean War, as many factories were rebuilt and refugees settled there.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> A leading figure in the 1960s was Rev.&nbsp;George Song (Jo Ji-Song), who joined the Youngdeungpo Mission in 1964. He sought to live among workers, emphasizing that ‚Äúthe gospel must be spoken in the language of the workers and carried in the suffering of their lives.‚Äù<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> He firmly believed that ‚Äúevangelizing workers is not merely about making them believe in Jesus, but about helping them live as human beings.‚Äù<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> George Song formed a women workers‚Äô fellowship called Shinbonghoe, which focused on fellowship, evangelism, and service, aiming to build a faith-based community from within the workers themselves.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> He described this approach as ‚Äúpreaching by living in the mines,‚Äù referring to the practice of student ministers living and working in labor environments to model incarnational ministry.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission, led by American Methodist missionary Rev.&nbsp;George Ogle, began in 1961 and pioneered a different model of pastoral work. Ogle insisted that ‚Äúministers must work alongside laborers and embody the gospel through shared labor.‚Äù<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> He launched the ‚Äúworking pastors program,‚Äù in which clergy were sent into factories to experience the workers‚Äô lives firsthand. He believed this was the only way the church could show that it truly stood with the poor and oppressed.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> Ogle asserted that the church should be socially responsible and democratic, stating, ‚ÄúWorkers must have a voice in the factories. Democratization must begin in the workplace.‚Äù<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> His prophetic ministry drew the ire of the government, and in 1974 he was expelled under charges of violating ‚Äúnational policy.‚Äù One of the triggering events was his statement: ‚ÄúWe must try to save the people of the People‚Äôs Revolutionary Party (Inhyeokdang), who have been sentenced without evidence.‚Äù<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The Urban Industrial Mission was not simply about preaching in factories‚Äîit was a bold theological response to industrial society‚Äôs contradictions. Both Song and Ogle challenged the traditional church‚Äôs detachment from social realities, arguing that the church must weep with the suffering and act for justice. Their efforts laid the foundation for the labor democratization movements that would rise in the following decades.

Blue Cross Medical Cooperative Ï≤≠Ïã≠ÏûêÏùòÎ£åÏ°∞Ìï©
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Amid the postwar poverty and social disintegration of 1960s Korea, the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative (<em>Cheongsipja</em>) emerged as a pioneering non-profit health insurance initiative. Organized and led by Christians, particularly Dr.&nbsp;Jang Gi-ryeo‚Äîa devout Presbyterian and compassionate surgeon‚Äîthis initiative played a crucial role in bridging the healthcare gap for low-income citizens at a time when the state lacked comprehensive public health insurance systems.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The cooperative was founded on May 13, 1968, in Busan, beginning with the participation of 23 local churches and 723 initial members. Within a month, membership rose to 1,129 across 35 churches and grew to 1,662 by the end of the year. Churches such as Bum-in Church (120 members) and Busan First Church (112 members) were key participants. By 1988, the cooperative had approximately 230,000 members, and over its two-decade operation, around 530,000 individuals had joined.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> The cooperative was deeply rooted in Christian ethics of love, sacrifice, and justice. Dr.&nbsp;Jang explicitly stated during the inaugural meeting, ‚ÄúIn the early Church, we saw the sharing of resources among believers. Yet this was not an imposed system like that of socialism or communism‚Äîit was voluntary.‚Äù<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> This reflected a theology of voluntary solidarity, rather than forced redistribution. The insurance system was shaped by principles of fairness and grace: all members paid a flat premium regardless of age, gender, or health risks (60 KRW/month), and anyone could join or withdraw freely.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> The organization was operated democratically, with decisions made by boards and member-elected representatives through consensus.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The idea for the Blue Cross emerged from the ‚ÄúBusan Meeting,‚Äù a Bible study and discussion group organized by Dr.&nbsp;Jang, where Christian students and intellectuals gathered. The arrival of Chae Gyu-cheol‚Äîwho had studied cooperative insurance in Denmark‚Äîled to a turning point. After he introduced the Danish model, the group decided to implement a similar system in Busan. The name Blue Cross was inspired by the American Blue Cross, but with no formal connection. The name was chosen over ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù to allow for broader participation while still maintaining a Christian ethos.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a> Despite early skepticism from the public, local churches provided critical support by promoting the insurance program among their congregations.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> The system‚Äôs democratic governance, egalitarian premiums, and transparent structure gained trust across communities. Dr.&nbsp;Jang, who had experienced North Korea‚Äôs public health model, sought a Christian and democratic alternative. His hospital‚Äîthe Gospel Hospital in Busan‚Äîserved as the center of medical services for Blue Cross members.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The Blue Cross Medical Cooperative holds enduring significance not only as a historical experiment in health care delivery but also as a model with relevant policy implications for contemporary systems. First, it offered a compelling alternative to commercial health insurance. Unlike profit-driven private insurers, which often prioritize financial returns over public welfare, the Blue Cross model was firmly rooted in non-profit, ethical principles. It demonstrated that affordable, equitable health coverage could be sustained without resorting to market mechanisms that often exclude the vulnerable. Second, the cooperative‚Äôs democratic governance structure served as a practical example of participatory decision-making in public health. Key decisions were made through elected representatives and community boards, fostering a sense of accountability and transparency that is frequently lacking in both state and commercial systems. This model suggests that involving beneficiaries in the decision-making process can enhance trust and responsiveness in health administration<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>. Third, the initiative highlighted how Christian values and institutions could serve broader public purposes in pluralistic societies. While grounded in Christian ethics, the cooperative did not discriminate based on religion, allowing people of all backgrounds to participate. This inclusivity underscores the potential of faith-based organizations to contribute meaningfully to public service and social innovation<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. Finally, the historical legacy of the Blue Cross Medical Cooperative lies in its influence on South Korea‚Äôs national policy. As a precursor to the National Health Insurance (NHI) system, which was officially launched in 1989, it served as both a conceptual and practical reference point. The cooperative‚Äôs archives, operational principles, and community-centered approach provided valuable lessons for the design of Korea‚Äôs universal healthcare infrastructure. In this way, Blue Cross affirmed the vital role that civil society‚Äîand especially faith-inspired actors‚Äîcan play in shaping public policy and expanding social welfare.

Bible Club Movement ÏÑ±Í≤ΩÍµ¨ÎùΩÎ∂ÄÏö¥Îèô
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1960s in South Korea were defined by postwar instability, authoritarian modernization, rural-urban division, and educational inequality‚Äîelements that together created both the necessity for and receptivity to grassroots Christian educational initiatives such as the Bible Club Movement.
</p>
<p>
Following the devastation of the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953), South Korea faced the immense task of national reconstruction. Though technically democratic under the First and Second Republics, the country fell into political chaos until a 1961 military coup led by General Park Chung Hee ushered in a new era of authoritarian developmentalism. Park‚Äôs regime emphasized political stability, national identity formation, and centralized planning to achieve rapid economic growth<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>. The government mobilized civil society under slogans like ‚Äúanti-communism,‚Äù ‚Äúnational discipline,‚Äù and ‚Äúspiritual reconstruction,‚Äù shaping a social climate where moral education and civic virtue became national priorities. This aligned closely with the goals of many Protestant institutions, including the Bible Clubs, which offered programs designed to promote self-discipline, patriotism, and moral integrity through a Christian lens. These clubs fit into a broader national strategy that sought to remake Korean citizens not only as economic actors but also as ideologically reliable subjects within a Cold War framework<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite economic growth, South Korea in the 1960s was still predominantly agrarian. Rural communities were left behind in terms of infrastructure, education, and job opportunities. This inequality led to massive internal migration, as young people left the countryside for urban industrial centers. In response, the government launched campaigns like the <em>Saemaul Undong</em> (New Village Movement) in the early 1970s, but its roots were already forming in the 1960s through the <em>National Reconstruction Movement</em>, which sought to re-educate the countryside with the values of diligence, cooperation, and modernization<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>. Bible Clubs in rural areas acted as early precursors to these efforts, operating as ‚Äúreconstruction schools‚Äù where rural youth were taught literacy, Christian ethics, basic hygiene, and work discipline. Many youth who were excluded from formal schooling because of cost or lack of facilities found alternative forms of education and community through these clubs.
</p>
<p>
The 1960s also exposed the limits of Korea‚Äôs public education system. While elementary school attendance became nearly universal thanks to compulsory education laws, secondary schooling remained inaccessible to a large portion of the population, especially in rural and working-class urban areas. In 1960, the middle school enrollment rate was only 26.9%; by 1970 it had risen to just 40.8%<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a>. The highly competitive nature of secondary education meant that many students were either unable to enroll or dropped out early. This gap created space for non-formal educational models like the Bible Clubs. As one scholar notes, ‚ÄúBible Clubs filled the vacuum left by an overstretched public education system, offering structured civic and moral training for youth in communities otherwise left behind by development.‚Äù<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> These clubs functioned not only as church schools but also as informal civic academies that supported both academic literacy and ethical instruction.
</p>
<p>
The global Cold War and U.S. support for South Korea also shaped the ideological landscape of the 1960s. American missionaries had long played a role in Korean education, and in the postwar period, U.S.-based Protestant organizations provided funding, personnel, and curriculum support to evangelical and educational efforts across the peninsula. Christianity, especially Protestantism, was viewed favorably by the South Korean state as a moral counterforce to communism<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Bible Club Movement operated within this Cold War matrix, emphasizing biblical literacy, anti-communist ethics, and civic engagement. Clubs often worked in tandem with local churches and foreign mission boards to produce instructional materials, train teachers, and develop faith-based approaches to civic responsibility. As such, Bible Clubs served not only as alternative schools but also as sites of ideological formation in South Korea‚Äôs larger national strategy of moral reconstruction.

Christian Education Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1960s was a transformative period for Christian education in Korea. Amidst the aftermath of the Korean War, rapid industrialization, and the rise of a military regime, Christian education sought to redefine its identity and establish a firm foundation within a drastically changing society. This era marked a transitional phase where Christian education moved beyond mere doctrinal instruction and began to develop into a recognized academic discipline that responded to social change.
</p>
<p>
Sunday schools became a central site for Christian education in this context. Having been weakened during the years of war and division, they regained vitality in the 1960s alongside the rapid expansion of church membership. By 1969, the total number of Christians in Korea was estimated to be around 3.19 million.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a> Participation was so high that Sunday school attendance in many churches rivaled the number of adult congregants. Known as ‚Äúbean sprout classrooms‚Äù due to the overcrowded conditions, Sunday schools served not only as sites for religious instruction but also as hubs for community outreach and evangelism.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
This widespread expansion is evident in statistical records. For example, in Daejeon in 1961, 8 out of 10 kindergartens were operated by Protestant institutions, and 246 out of 348 children (71%) were enrolled in Christian kindergartens. In secondary education, Protestant schools enrolled 818 out of 11,834 total middle school students (6.9% overall, 18.4% among private school students). At the high school level, 452 students attended Christian schools such as Daesung High School (122) and Hosudon Girls‚Äô High School (330), comprising 5.4% of all students and 17.2% of those in private schools. In higher education, four out of five institutions in Daejeon were Christian-affiliated, with 394 out of 2,642 students (15%) enrolled in these schools.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> These figures reflect the significant role Christian education played in private education during the time.
</p>
<p>
In 1960, Soongsil University established the first department of Christian education in Korea, and the following year saw the founding of the Korean Society of Christian Education. These developments institutionalized the academic study of Christian education and contributed to the formulation of denominational educational policies, the development of curricula, and the theoretical foundations of church education.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a> The introduction of the roles of educational evangelists and education-oriented pastoral ministries also took shape during this period.
</p>
<p>
Despite these institutional advancements, the internal quality of Christian education often lagged behind the church‚Äôs rapid quantitative growth. Instruction remained predominantly didactic and focused on children and youth, with little attention to adult or social education. Concepts such as social justice, democracy, and human rights were rarely addressed. Kim Kwan-suk, in a 1967 issue of <em>Christian Education</em>, criticized the apathy of educators, referring to issues such as ‚Äúurbanization and sex,‚Äù ‚Äúmass society indifference,‚Äù and ‚Äúloss of identity.‚Äù<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, government education reforms under President Park Chung-hee posed structural challenges to Christian schools. Policies such as the middle school entrance lottery (1969) and high school equalization (1973) curtailed the schools‚Äô autonomy and religious identity. The Ministry of Education attempted to limit religious instruction, and backlash from students and parents further complicated the schools‚Äô operations.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the 1960s served as a critical foundation for the academic and institutional development of Christian education in Korea. The establishment of the Korean Society of Christian Education enabled subsequent generations of educators to bridge theological scholarship with educational practice, thus providing the groundwork for more professionalized and sustainable Christian education within churches and schools alike.

Credit Union Movement Ïã†Ïö©ÌòëÎèôÏ°∞Ìï©Ïö¥Îèô
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The credit union movement in 1960s South Korea emerged as a powerful expression of Christian social engagement, particularly in the industrial centers of Incheon and Yeongdeungpo. Rooted in the values of solidarity, justice, and community, these Christian-led financial cooperatives offered a critical response to the harsh realities faced by laborers during a period of rapid industrialization and authoritarian rule. Protestant and Catholic churches, especially through the activities of Urban Industrial Missions (UIMs), played a pivotal role in both initiating and sustaining these grassroots economic initiatives.
</p>
<p>
Initially, most credit unions were established within Catholic parish communities. For instance, in Incheon, the first credit union‚ÄîDapdong Credit Union‚Äîwas founded in 1962 and was followed by similar organizations that relied on parish-based networks of trust. Of the ten credit unions established in Incheon during the 1960s, eight were formed by members of Catholic congregations. However, by the late 1960s, there was a marked transition from religious to workplace-based credit unions. This transformation began with the creation of the Daesung Credit Union in 1968, followed by the Incheon Heavy Industries Credit Union in 1969 and the Sanwoo Credit Union in 1970. These unions were established by workers in large factories and were heavily supported by the Incheon Urban Industrial Mission, which was affiliated with the Methodist Church. The UIM not only promoted these unions as a form of economic empowerment but also incorporated them into its broader mission of pastoral care and social justice.
</p>
<p>
By the mid-1970s, Incheon had become home to 33 credit unions. Among them, eleven were organized through Catholic churches, five through Protestant denominations (mainly Methodist and Presbyterian), and thirteen were based on workplace solidarity. This progression from church-based to workplace-based models reflected a significant shift in the way community and solidarity were conceptualized and practiced. As one study notes, ‚ÄúIncheon exemplifies how the credit union movement, facilitated by the Christian Urban Industrial Mission, expanded from church-based networks to workplace and then to community-based solidarities.‚Äù<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
A parallel movement unfolded in Yeongdeungpo, where the Yeongdeungpo Industrial Development Credit Union was founded in 1969 through the efforts of female factory workers closely connected to the Yeongdeungpo Urban Industrial Mission of the Presbyterian Church. The credit union addressed the severe financial exclusion faced by low-wage workers, many of whom had no access to bank loans and were forced to borrow from moneylenders at interest rates exceeding 72% annually. In contrast, the credit union offered loans at a much lower rate‚Äîaround 24% per year‚Äîsignificantly easing the financial burdens of its members.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a> This credit union, operated primarily by women, also became a site for democratic participation and social organization. Women laborers not only managed the financial operations but also led efforts to form consumer cooperatives, housing cooperatives, and other mutual aid organizations. The spirit of the movement was captured in the cooperative motto: ‚ÄúOne for all, all for one.‚Äù As Pastor George Song, who led the mission, explained, ‚ÄúThe labor union movement is a fight to earn more wages, while the credit union movement is a fight to protect what has been earned. They are essentially the same struggle.‚Äù Despite its success, the Yeongdeungpo credit union came under political pressure. In 1978, the government revoked its legal status after the union refused to comply with a financial audit, viewing it as an unjustified intrusion. The credit union responded by continuing its work as an unregistered cooperative called ‚ÄúDaramjwihoe‚Äù (Squirrel Society), maintaining its principles of economic solidarity and democratic governance in defiance of state repression.
</p>
<p>
These developments reveal how Christian missions in 1960s Korea went far beyond traditional evangelism. The Urban Industrial Missions embedded themselves in the lived realities of industrial workers, combining faith with concrete social action. Through the credit union movement, the church not only addressed immediate material needs but also fostered participatory structures that empowered marginalized communities. In doing so, the Christian credit union movement laid an early foundation for economic democratization and offered a compelling model of what a socially engaged gospel might look like in practice.

Catholic Agrarian and Labor Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
During the 1960s, South Korea, under the Park Chung Hee regime, entered a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization, which structurally marginalized rural communities and farmers. In response to these social upheavals, the Catholic Church, influenced by the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65), began actively engaging in public issues based on its renewed focus on social justice and human dignity. The Church‚Äôs efforts to resolve the rural crisis centered on organizing farmers, founding cooperatives, and launching rural education programs<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>. In this context, the Catholic Labor Youth Association (YCW) established a rural youth division in 1964, which later became the Korean Catholic Rural Youth Association in 1966. In 1972, this organization expanded into the Korean Catholic Farmers‚Äô Movement (KCFM), which embraced adult farmers as well. Their movement combined spiritual beliefs with a pursuit of social justice through action. The movement was also closely connected with international Catholic organizations such as Misereor and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, and figures like Maria Sailer played critical roles in securing international financial and organizational support<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. In the latter half of the 1960s, Catholic agrarian movements took root through credit unions and farmer education initiatives. In Goesan County, Father Jang Je-nam (Clyde Davis) led the foundation of the Goesan Livestock Cooperative Association in 1968. It served not only as a livestock enterprise but also as a hub for farmer self-sufficiency, education, and community building. The association managed four pastures‚ÄîJungang, Baekyang, Goma, and Maej≈èn‚Äîand expanded into credit unions and consumer cooperatives, later evolving into the Chungbuk Rural Development Association<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Wonju, under the leadership of Bishop Ji Hak-sun, the Jingwang Cooperative Education Institute and Jingwang Credit Union were founded. Bishop Ji regarded cooperatives as a way to practice the Gospel in solidarity with the poor, describing them as a means for the Church to become more integrated with society<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. On the labor front, the Catholic Church also played a pivotal role in the 1966‚Äì68 textile labor movement on Ganghwa Island. Father Michael Bransfield, stationed at Ganghwa Parish, witnessed the dire working conditions of young women laborers and wrote to his Maryknoll superiors describing how ‚Äúthese young girls constantly bleed from the nose and collapse at their machines‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>. He requested assistance from the Catholic Labor Youth Association (JOC), which dispatched labor educator Song Ok-ja to organize female workers through catechetical and social education programs<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>. On August 14, 1967, a labor union was established at Simdo Textile Factory, and the inaugural union ceremony was held in the convent of the local parish‚Äîa historically unprecedented event demonstrating the Church‚Äôs full support<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. The company responded with intimidation, firings, and threats, but union members continued to organize secretly, collecting signatures and mobilizing community support<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing the severity of the conflict, Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan convened a National JOC Chaplains‚Äô Meeting at Ganghwa Parish in July 1967. This marked the first ecumenical gathering involving Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant clergy to address labor issues collectively. Father Bransfield, at the conference, remarked, ‚ÄúWhat Koreans do not lack is knowledge of God, but rather a concern for the misery of human life and laborers‚Äô suffering‚Äù<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. As the union expanded, the local employers‚Äô association began a collective boycott of Catholic workers, and the Simdo factory was shut down. The incident escalated to a national crisis, as employers and local political elites labeled the unionists as communists, while security forces surveilled and detained union leaders. Nonetheless, union head Park Bu-yang, initially appointed by management, became sympathetic to the workers and later led the resistance. Despite harsh repression, the labor union achieved its first collective agreement on November 4, 1967<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the Catholic agrarian and labor movements of the 1960s were not mere acts of charity or mission outreach but became acts of faith in action, confronting structural injustice in Korean society. Through cooperative organizing, labor solidarity, women‚Äôs empowerment, and ecumenical collaboration, the Church underwent a fundamental transformation into an open and engaged community within Korean civil society.

<p>
Ecumenical Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
During the 1960s, the ecumenical movement in Korea developed amid the aftereffects of the Korean War, the rise of Cold War ideologies, and internal church divisions. Korean Presbyterian churches, in particular, experienced repeated splits and reunification attempts, largely centered on differing stances regarding the World Council of Churches (WCC). The denomination eventually split into four major branches‚ÄîKosin, the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (PROK), Tonghap (the Presbyterian Church of Korea), and Hapdong‚Äîeach establishing its own theological identity while also participating in interdenominational ecumenical efforts.
</p>
<p>
Jung Byung Joon notes, ‚ÄúAll attempts at Presbyterian reunification during the 1960s failed, leaving deep wounds on both sides. Moreover, as each denomination was experiencing growth, they did not find reunification urgently necessary.‚Äù Nonetheless, he asserts, ‚Äúit remains a crucial historical task to preserve the record of those processes and their meanings‚Äù<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. In 1959, a major schism occurred within the Presbyterian Church of Korea over its relationship with the WCC, resulting in a split between the Yeondong (later Tonghap) and Seungdong (later Hapdong) factions. Between 1960 and 1968, five reunification attempts were made but ultimately failed, and in 1969 the Tonghap denomination officially voted to rejoin the WCC<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>. The first of these attempts, the 1959‚Äì1960 Yeondong-Seungdong reunification effort, fell apart due to unresolved differences. While the Yeondong faction confirmed its withdrawal from the WCC, it firmly rejected any alliance with the International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC). The Seungdong faction, meanwhile, adopted a more hardline position, demanding not only the cessation of WCC participation but also the dismissal of all Yeondong-appointed seminary faculty and a formal apology from the three foreign mission boards that supported the Yeondong General Assembly<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a>. Negotiations ultimately collapsed. A key figure reflected, ‚ÄúThe Seungdong faction refused to reunite because they believed they would win the lawsuit. They thought that a legal victory would not only give them the seminary but also all church properties nationwide‚Äù<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a>. Despite this failure, ecumenical efforts persisted. In 1961, informal discussions began between Tonghap and the PROK, aiming at ‚Äúreunion.‚Äù These efforts included pulpit exchanges and proposals for shared ministry. The PROK even passed a resolution stating its commitment to ‚Äústrive for Presbyterian reunion through partial integration where possible,‚Äù though these efforts too were blocked by conservative forces<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a>. Meanwhile, debates over WCC re-affiliation intensified within the Tonghap denomination, culminating in its official decision to rejoin the WCC at the 54th General Assembly in 1969<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
The theological underpinnings of the ecumenical movement during this period are reflected in WCC General Assembly themes. For example, the 1961 New Delhi Assembly was held under the theme ‚ÄúJesus Christ, the Light of the World,‚Äù emphasizing the church‚Äôs calling to be a light amid global crises. According to Jung Byung Joon, this theme ‚Äúcalled on churches to overcome division and engage in social witness in the light of Christ‚Äù<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a>. The 1968 Uppsala Assembly followed with the theme ‚ÄúBehold, I Make All Things New,‚Äù shifting the focus toward social participation and the church‚Äôs role in promoting justice<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Within the Korean church, a growing awareness of ecumenical identity also emerged. Ahn Kyo Seong described the Tonghap denomination as one that ‚Äúunderstood itself as a church rooted in the ecumenical tradition of the 1907 Presbyterian Church in Korea,‚Äù and asserted that ‚Äúecumenicity is not merely about WCC affiliation but concerns the very essence of the church‚Äù<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a>. This ecumenical character was, in part, inherited from the interdenominational cooperation of early missionaries, which shaped the foundational ethos of the Korean church.
</p>
<p>
Within this historical context, Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-jik‚Äôs ministry stands as a practical embodiment of ecumenical spirit combined with evangelical commitment. His threefold mission of evangelism, education, and social service reflected a holistic vision of the church‚Äôs mission. Rather than separating evangelism from social engagement, he maintained that ‚Äúchurch social service should not remain at the level of temporary relief but should be carried out at a structural level‚Äù<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a>. Han did not view church growth or numerical increase as the sole purpose of mission; instead, he integrated social responsibility into the gospel‚Äôs witness.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, the ecumenical movement in Korea during the 1960s, despite facing theological tensions and organizational setbacks, served as a critical period in which churches explored new forms of unity, expanded their theological horizons, and sought meaningful social engagement. The experiences of this decade laid the groundwork for deeper global partnerships, the integration of faith and justice, and the rediscovery of the public role of the church.

Minjok Evangelization Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Minjok Evangelization Movement that emerged in 1960s Korea was not merely a campaign to increase church membership or spread the gospel on an individual level. Rather, it represented an ambitious evangelical project aiming to save the entire Korean nation through the gospel and to reconstruct the state on Christian principles. Rooted in the traumatic experiences of national division, war, and ideological conflict, this movement was both a religious practice of healing and a theological-political attempt to fuse Christian mission with Korean nationalism and anti-communism. The ideological foundation of the movement can be traced to Rev.&nbsp;Han Kyung-chik, whose pastoral theology emphasized holistic transformation. As he stated in a 1947 sermon: ‚ÄúEvangelism is the greatest political movement, and anyone can participate in it. If we launch this evangelistic movement with Christian ideals and transform the mindset of the entire Korean people through Christian thought, then the righteous nation, an independent Christian Korea, will surely be realized.‚Äù<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a> For Han, evangelism was not confined to saving individual souls but aimed at initiating a spiritual revolution that would reform families, churches, society, and the nation. This philosophy materialized in the National Evangelization Movement of 1965, initiated by Han Kyung-chik and Kim Hwal-lan. Inspired by the Latin American model of ‚ÄúEvangelism-in-Depth,‚Äù this movement sought to mobilize all Korean churches in a nationwide, interdenominational gospel campaign. Han emphasized the importance of this effort, declaring, ‚ÄúIf we designate 1965 as the Year of National Evangelization and launch a united movement encompassing all churches, this will not only benefit the church but also the nation and people.‚Äù<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the 1960s witnessed the rise of evangelical student mission organizations, with Kim Joon-gon‚Äôs Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) leading the way. Founded in 1958, CCC initially focused on campus ministry, but soon expanded its vision to encompass national transformation. In a 1971 CCC gathering, Kim declared, ‚ÄúMobilizing two million Christians for evangelism is the fastest and most effective way to achieve national revolution and unification.‚Äù<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a> This perspective made evangelism the primary strategy for national salvation. CCC‚Äôs strategy was systematized through a threefold model of evangelism, discipleship, and mission-sending. While large-scale events like Explo ‚Äô74 would mark the climax of this vision in the 1970s, the strategic foundations were already being laid in the late 1960s. Under Kim‚Äôs leadership, CCC initiated mass evangelism training, local Bible study cells, and citywide spiritual campaigns such as the ‚ÄúHoly City Movement,‚Äù all of which reflected the logic of gospel-centered national transformation.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Han Kyung-chik promoted national evangelization through other means, including military and industrial mission work. His ‚ÄúTotal Christianization of the Armed Forces‚Äù program, supported by the government, was framed as both a religious and anti-communist strategy. Conversely, his attempts to evangelize laborers through the Industrial Mission eventually met resistance due to conflicts over workers‚Äô rights, culminating in Youngnak Church‚Äôs decision to end support for the movement in 1983. This illustrated the limitations of the movement in achieving structural social change, despite its success in fostering spiritual renewal.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the Minjok Evangelization Movement of the 1960s embodied a complex and dynamic synthesis of interchurch unity, evangelical revivalism, Christian nationalism, and anti-communism. While Han Kyung-chik focused on church unity and evangelism in the military and labor sectors, Kim Joon-gon and CCC built a highly structured student-centered mission network that aimed to disciple future national leaders. These efforts culminated in large-scale campaigns in the 1970s and played a decisive role in the rapid growth of Korean Protestantism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Interrelated Movements and the Minjok Evangelization Movement in 1960s</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Minjok Evangelization Movement of the 1960s was not an isolated campaign but a multifaceted evangelical response to Korea‚Äôs national division, rapid industrialization, and ideological polarization. It intersected with several key Christian movements of the time‚Äîurban industrial mission, Christian education reform, the ecumenical movement, and the Christian credit union movement. Each movement contributed to the broader framework of national evangelization in its own unique way.

Pentecostal Movement
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1960s marked a pivotal period for the Pentecostal Movement in Korea, as it transitioned from a fringe revivalist impulse to a structured and widely popular religious force. Rooted in the 1906 Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, the Pentecostal emphasis on Spirit baptism and glossolalia (speaking in tongues) entered Korea through American missionary Mary Rumsey in 1928, followed by the establishment of the first Pentecostal church in Seobinggo in 1932.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a> The movement was formally institutionalized with the founding of the Korean Assemblies of God in 1953. A transformative figure in this process was Pastor Yonggi Cho, who, along with Choi Ja-sil, began his ministry in a tent church in 1958. His ministry flourished during the 1960s, culminating in the establishment of Yoido Full Gospel Church, which would later become the world‚Äôs largest congregation. As Bae notes, ‚Äúthrough glossolalia, divine healing, and exorcism, the Pentecostal leaders delivered messages of hope and healing to a suffering Korean public.‚Äù<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Pastor Cho developed a contextualized theology centered on the ‚ÄúThreefold Blessing‚Äù (salvation, prosperity, health) and the ‚ÄúFivefold Gospel‚Äù (salvation, Spirit baptism, healing, blessing, and the Second Coming). This theology emphasized Spirit baptism ‚Äúnot as an internal emotional experience, but as an empowering force for life transformation,‚Äù thus distinguishing it from more doctrinal or institutional forms of Protestantism.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a> The spiritual emphasis of the movement found widespread resonance in postwar Korean society, which was recovering from national trauma and grappling with rapid industrialization. As Ryu observes, ‚ÄúPentecostalism became a channel of healing and recovery for those suffering from physical illness and spiritual exhaustion.‚Äù<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a> People who were marginalized economically and socially found solace in divine healing, communal prayer, and supernatural experiences like visions and prophecy.
</p>
<p>
By the 1970s, Korean Pentecostalism had extended its influence beyond national borders. Pastor Cho gained international attention through publications like <em>Charisma</em> magazine and was identified as one of the most influential charismatic leaders worldwide.

Indigenization Debate in the Korean Church
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The indigenization debate in 1960s Korea was not merely a matter of theological semantics, but a critical rethinking of the relationship between the universality of the gospel and the particularity of cultural contexts. This discourse developed in parallel with global theological movements such as the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) and the World Council of Churches‚Äô emphasis on inculturation. At its core, the debate centered on whether the gospel could be rooted in local cultures, and how Christian theology might engage with indigenous religious and philosophical traditions. It reflected a post-colonial desire among Korean theologians to move beyond transplanted Western missionary theology and toward a theologically autonomous expression grounded in Korean religious sentiments.<br> <br> <strong>Yoo Dong-sik: Interpreting the Gospel Through the Lens of Dao</strong>
</p>
<p>
In his early works ‚ÄúDao and Logos‚Äù (1959) and ‚ÄúThe Task of Indigenizing the Gospel in Korea‚Äù (1962), Yoo Dong-sik proposed that the Korean mind is more aligned with the Eastern concept of ‚ÄòDao‚Äô than with the Western notion of ‚ÄòLogos.‚Äô He argued, ‚ÄúAttempting to interpret the gospel solely through Western concepts obscures its essence,‚Äù emphasizing the need to express the gospel in culturally resonant terms.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a><br> <br> <strong>Jun Kyung-yeon: The Gospel as Transcultural Revelation</strong>
</p>
<p>
In his 1963 essay ‚ÄúCan Christian Culture Be Indigenized?‚Äù, Jun countered Yoo‚Äôs proposal by arguing that ‚ÄúThe gospel is not something that simply takes root in a culture; it is a transcendent revelation.‚Äù He criticized Yoo‚Äôs approach for compromising ‚Äúthe uniqueness and transcendence of the gospel.‚Äù<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a><br> <br> <strong>Yoon Sung-beom: Seeking Trinitarian Hints in Dangun Mythology</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yoon interpreted Korea‚Äôs Dangun mythology as a ‚ÄúVestigium Trinitatis‚Äù‚Äîa foreshadowing of the Trinity. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe triadic structure of Hwanin, Hwanung, and Hwangeom aligns with the Christian understanding of the Creator, Redeemer, and Perfecter.‚Äù<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142" role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a><br> <br> <strong>Park Bong-rang and Lee Sang-young: Critical Response</strong>
</p>
<p>
Park and Lee strongly opposed Yoon‚Äôs interpretation, criticizing it as a form of religious syncretism. Lee in particular asserted, ‚ÄúDangun mythology is not a precursor to Christian revelation but mere myth; it contains no redemptive truth.‚Äù<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
While the debate in theological circles was vibrant, the institutional church showed limited enthusiasm for actual structural reforms. Worship formats, church architecture, and musical styles remained heavily Westernized. Lee Sang-gyu noted, ‚ÄúKorean churches affirmed indigenization in theory but rarely implemented it in worship, education, or liturgical form.‚Äù<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a> Many Korean Protestants equated Christian faith with ‚ÄòChristian culture,‚Äô which they in turn equated with Western civilization. As Lee observed, this tendency ‚Äúled the church to confuse the gospel with imported Christian customs.‚Äù<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a> Church buildings adopted Romanesque and Gothic styles, with pulpits and chancels modeled after Western designs. Lee pointed out, ‚ÄúSuch structures were more reflective of inculturation than true indigenization.‚Äù<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite institutional hesitance, the indigenization debate marked a turning point. It compelled Korean theologians to reimagine Christianity in cultural terms and laid the foundation for later theological movements such as Minjung theology, liberation theology, and ecological theology. While the church as a whole remained structurally unchanged, this period sparked Korea‚Äôs transition from imported to creative theology.

<p>
The Winter of Christianity in North Korea
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The 1960s represented a stark nadir for Protestant Christianity in North Korea. While outwardly the religion seemed to have vanished, in reality, a remnant of faithful believers persisted underground. Jooseop Keum describes this era as <em>‚ÄúThe Winter of Christianity in North Korea,‚Äù</em> spanning from 1958 to 1972, when Christianity was virtually banned and violently suppressed by the Communist regime.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
As Keum explains, ‚ÄúFrom 1958 to 1972, Christianity in North Korea was effectively outlawed under the Anti-Religious Campaign, leading to the near-total disappearance of public religious life.‚Äù<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a> This Anti-Religious Campaign was both ideological and institutional, aimed at eliminating all forms of religion‚Äîincluding Buddhism and Shamanism‚Äîbut especially targeting Christianity as a perceived ideological rival to Juche.
</p>
<p>
Background: Political and Ideological Suppression The campaign officially began in 1958, after the Christian boycott of the 1957 local elections, which the regime interpreted as a challenge to Kim Il-sung‚Äôs authority. Keum notes that even a small act of nonconformity was sufficient to initiate broad suppression: ‚ÄúAlthough the boycott was carried on in only one county, it was enough stimulation for Kim Il-sung and his followers to oppress the Christians throughout North Korea.‚Äù<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> The ideological foundations were articulated in publications like Jung Ha-cheol‚Äôs <em>Why Do We Oppose Religion?</em> (1959), which defined religion as ‚Äúthe opium of the people‚Ä¶ a fatalistic ideology that weakens revolutionary spirit.‚Äù<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a> By 1959, the Korean Workers‚Äô Party had published six anti-religious booklets, systematically targeting Christianity for its links to American imperialism, its support for South Korea during the war, and its obstruction of socialist reconstruction.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Christian leaders and laypersons were arrested, executed, or sent to forced labor camps. Underground churches in Pyongan and Hwanghae provinces were raided. In 1968, for example, members of a house church in Onchun County were arrested and deported to mines.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> The most far-reaching tactic of the Anti-Religious Campaign was the resident reclassification program, which lasted from 1958 to 1969. Citizens were grouped into three main classes‚Äîcore, basic, and hostile‚Äîand into 51 sub-categories. Christians were typically placed in <em>Section 38</em>, labeled for ‚Äúspecial observation.‚Äù Even Christians who supported the state could not hold high-ranking positions.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a> According to Keum, <em>‚ÄúThe total number of Protestant Christians dropped from 50,000 in 1953 to around 5,000 by 1972,‚Äù</em> a loss of 90%, much of which can be attributed to forced apostasy, exile, execution, or despair.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Despite persecution, many believers remained faithful. Keum uses the biblical metaphor of Isaiah‚Äôs holy remnant to describe their endurance: ‚ÄúThe Christians in the North are considered theologically, on an analogue with the ‚Äòremnants‚Äô in Isaiah, as a ‚Äòholy seed‚Äô for the revival and renewal of Christianity in North Korea.‚Äù<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a> Christians held clandestine gatherings in house churches, which were often composed of small groups of fewer than ten people. In Kaesong, laypeople divided into eastern, western, and northern districts and began gathering in homes as early as 1954.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a> A particularly moving account comes from Elder Se-yong Kang, daughter of a martyred pastor, who said she continued attending prayer meetings during the campaign period.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a> Many believers prayed alone, memorized scripture, and maintained faith without clergy or formal sacraments. <em>‚ÄúHundreds of house groups met in homes, worshipped and studied the Bible together, without ministers,‚Äù</em> Keum writes.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
In 1972, following a constitutional revision that loosened restrictions on religious activity, the Korean Christian Federation (KCF) resumed public operations. Pyongyang Theological Seminary was reopened, individual Christians were urged to register, and two historic churches‚ÄîBongsu Church and Chilgol Church‚Äîwere restored. By 1988, the number of house churches had grown to 511.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a> This movement, Keum argues, was not merely a political accommodation but part of a deeper theological shift: ‚ÄúThe revival of Protestant Christianity in North Korea was not the result of a compromising accommodation with the Communist government, but the consequence of its effective articulation of a minjung-centered approach.‚Äù<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a>
