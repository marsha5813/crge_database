<li>Policies on the Withdrawal of Missionaries from Enemy Nations (Yang Weihua 2020: 91-93; Zhang Le 2020: 114-120)</li>
</ol>
<p>On July 2, 1941, China formally severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy. Both governments planned to evacuate their citizens from China, but the majority of German and Italian missionaries insisted on remaining in the country. In August, Foreign Minister Guo Taichi stated that German and Italian missionaries could continue to reside in China as long as they focused on their missionary activities and complied with Chinese laws. However, local military and political authorities were dissatisfied with the Foreign Ministry‚Äôs stance and demanded the removal of all such foreigners to prevent them from acting as spies.</p>
<p>On December 9, China declared war on Germany and Italy, categorizing the remaining German and Italian missionaries as enemy aliens. The Foreign Ministry issued orders to keep these foreigners under temporary protection and surveillance, allowing them to stay in their original locations while monitoring their communications. Nonetheless, calls for more stringent measures began to emerge. To establish norms and unify perspectives, the Foreign Ministry consulted with various departments and initially determined that missionaries should not receive any shelter but be concentrated in designated churches under local supervision to continue their religious work. The Military Commission emphasized that several espionage cases disguised as missionary work had already been uncovered, making the justification for continued missionary activities questionable. Nevertheless, the Foreign Ministry insisted on preserving the status quo, emphasizing that the Vatican and foreign missionary organizations had greatly assisted in wartime efforts and propaganda, and due to the relatively lenient treatment by Germany and Italy toward their nationals, concentrated oversight would be sufficient to mitigate espionage concerns.</p>
<p>In January 1942, the Foreign Ministry published the ‚ÄúRegulations on the Treatment of Enemy Nationals‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRegulations on the Concentration and Surveillance of Enemy National Clergy.‚Äù Article 13 stipulated that enemy clergy should be concentrated in designated Catholic or locally led Jesus churches while continuing their missionary work under the supervision of local authorities. The guidelines emphasized that clergy would be stationed in designated churches for evangelistic endeavors, in keeping with the established directives.</p>
<p>In June 1942, after establishing diplomatic relations with the Vatican, Chiang Kai-shek proposed three principles for handling enemy national clergy: (1) Those suspected of espionage would be treated as enemy aliens; (2) Those without suspicion could freely preach within designated areas but were prohibited from entering military zones; (3) Church properties that needed to be returned would be handled accordingly unless proven to be hostile. The Executive Yuan issued a directive to implement these principles on June 25.</p>

<li>Missionaries Detained in Internment Camps During the Occupation (Leck 2006; Zhang Qinying 2020: 63-109)</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, American and British missionaries in China‚Äôs occupied regions were classified as enemy aliens and confined to various internment camps (Civilian Internment Camps).</p>
<p>The main detention centers included: Shenyang, Beiping, Shandong (Weixian, Qingdao), Shanghai (Pudong, Longhua, Zhabei, Lincoln Road, Daxilu, the Cathedral, Shanghai West, Xujiahui, Franciscan Church, Yuyuan Road, and more than ten other locations), and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Statistics reveal that during World War II, the number of Western civilians interned by the Japanese military in Asia was roughly comparable to that of prisoners of war, totaling approximately 130,000 individuals. Among these, around 9,350 Western civilians were detained in China. Scholars have pointed out that because expatriates were not military POWs, internment camps should not be equated with POW camps or compared to Nazi Germany‚Äôs concentration camps. If American and British missionaries did not evacuate from China, they too would be interned. It is generally believed that the number of missionaries detained in Chinese internment camps was approximately 1,200.</p>
<p>Some of these detention centers were located within areas associated with Christian and Catholic organizations. For instance, nearly a thousand individuals were held at the Weixian internment camp, associated with the Courtyard of the Happy Way operated by the Presbyterian Church in North America, which served as a grouping of church buildings that included a church, hospital, and school. The Stanley internment camp in Hong Kong was situated within the premises of the Anglican St.&nbsp;Stephen‚Äôs College. Detention centers such as the Cathedral in Xujiahui, the Jesuit Theological Institute, and the Franciscan Church in Shanghai were also locations for imprisoning missionaries and clergy.</p>
<p>Notable missionaries detained at the Weixian internment camp included Watson M. Hayes, President of North China Theological Seminary; Eric Liddell, the British Olympic champion from the 1924 games and a teacher at Tianjin New Learning School, who died in the camp on February 21, 1945; Father Raymond J. de Jaegher; and L. Y. Davies, academic dean at Shandong University. Ralph A. Ward, Bishop of the American Methodist Church, was also interned in Shanghai and Beiping. John L. Stuart, President of Yenching University, was imprisoned in Beiping.</p>

<li>The Imprisonment of Chinese Theologian Zhao Zichen (Xing Fuzeng 2005: 286-289)</li>
</ol>
<p>On December 8, 1941, the Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor, marking the beginning of the Pacific War. Due to hostilities between Japan and the United States, Christian schools, hospitals, and organizations throughout North China were blockaded by Japanese forces. All British and American-run primary and secondary schools in Beiping were taken over by the Japanese military. The circumstances surrounding Yenching University were dire as well; just hours after the Pearl Harbor incident, Japanese troops surrounded the campus, capturing 11 professors, including Zhao Zichen, Zhang Dongxun, Lu Zhiwei, and Hong Weilian.</p>
<p>While imprisoned, Zhao resolved that upon his release he would accomplish three goals: first, to recuperate and restore his health; second, to write books; and third, to ‚Äúhelp the church achieve self-sufficiency and independence, transforming it into a church that belongs to China and does not rely on outsiders.‚Äù Despite enduring great suffering during his imprisonment, his faith became a source of strength, with prayer serving as his greatest source of empowerment. Simultaneously, he provided comfort to fellow prisoners through his faith.</p>
<p>Zhao was imprisoned until June 18, 1942, totaling 193 days in confinement. Following his release, he was sheltered by Ling Xianyang, president of the North China Anglican Church, residing within the Anglican compound in Beiping. During this time, Zhao completed manuscripts for ‚ÄúChristian Progress‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Life of St.&nbsp;Paul.‚Äù Later, he documented his experiences in prison in ‚ÄúMemoirs of Imprisonment,‚Äù published in 1948.</p>

<li>The Communist Party‚Äôs Religious Policies During the War of Resistance (Wang Jianlang, Huang Kewu 2021: 941-942; Central Committee 1992a: 316; Chen Jinlong 2006: 74)</li>
</ol>
<p>In May 1941, Mao Zedong drafted the ‚ÄúGovernance Guidelines for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region,‚Äù which stated: ‚ÄúProtect the religious freedom of all anti-Japanese citizens (landlords, capitalists, farmers, workers, etc.) and respect the religious beliefs and customs of the Mongolian and Hui ethnic groups.‚Äù When explaining this article, the border region government clarified that ‚Äúreligion refers to Islam, Lamaism, Catholicism, etc.‚Äù ‚ÄúWeakened ethnic groups and those believing in religion all have rights, and no one can restrict anyone else.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúTemporary Regulations on Land Use in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region,‚Äù published in 1941, stipulated: ‚ÄúLand contracts obtained lawfully by Catholic and Protestant churches shall be recognized as owned by the church; foreign missionaries who purchased or donated land in a personal capacity shall arrange for the ownership of that land to be transferred to the relevant church or school.‚Äù In January 1942, the Communist Party issued attachments to the ‚ÄúCentral Committee‚Äôs Decision on Land Policy in Anti-Japanese Base Areas,‚Äù stating: ‚ÄúReligious land (including land owned by Christian, Buddhist, Islamic, Taoist, and other sects) shall remain unchanged.‚ÄùIn the winter of 1934, Liu Liangmo organized a mass singing event in Shanghai under the YMCA and initiated the movement for songs of national salvation, composing a song titled ‚ÄúSave China.‚Äù In 1935, he collaborated with Lu Gancheng, the general secretary of the Shanghai YMCA, to establish a singing group within the organization. In May, he recorded ‚ÄúThe March of the Volunteers‚Äù on vinyl, which became an important piece performed by the singing group. When the ‚ÄúSeven Gentlemen‚Äù like Shen Junru were arrested by the government, Liu also participated in rescue efforts. In January 1936, the ‚ÄúShanghai United National Salvation Federation‚Äù was established, with Shanghai Christians issuing a declaration opposing passive diplomacy and demanding the use of force to uphold national integrity and dignity, of which Liu was one of the 28 initiators. In May, the ‚ÄúNational United Salvation Federation‚Äù was formed in Shanghai, and Liu served as a board member. During various activities organized by the Federation, Liu Liangmo led the singing of ‚ÄúThe March of the Volunteers,‚Äù earning him the title of ‚Äúcheerleader for the Salvation Federation‚Äù from Shen Junru and others. In June 1936, during the first anniversary of the establishment of the National United Salvation Federation, the mass singing group held a large singing event at the Shanghai Public Gymnasium, where Liu conducted from the stage.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1936, Liu traveled to the United States to attend the ‚ÄúWorld Student Christian Federation‚Äù conference held in San Francisco. After returning to China, he joined the YMCA‚Äôs ‚ÄúMilitary Services Department,‚Äù working in various places such as Suiyuan, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, and Changsha to promote services for soldiers. During this time, he authored ‚ÄúThe ABCs of Mass Singing,‚Äù which detailed how to teach the masses to sing and organize community singing groups.</p>
<p>In 1939, while in Jinhua, Zhejiang, he met with Zhou Enlai. Later, Liu was briefly detained by the Nationalist Party in Ningbo under suspicions of being a Communist but was released and subsequently applied to the YMCA to continue his studies in the United States.</p>
<p>From the summer of 1940 until August 1949, Liu Liangmo was primarily active in the United States, studying at Crozer Theological Seminary and the University of Pennsylvania. During this time, he also campaigned for China‚Äôs anti-Japanese efforts and organized singing groups among the expatriate community. After the victory in the anti-Japanese war, he continued to stay in the U.S., preparing to establish the American branch of the ‚ÄúChina Democratic League.‚Äù In September 1946, when Feng Yuxiang spoke in the U.S., Liu served as his translator.</p>
<p>In August 1949, Liu Liangmo received a telegram from Zhou Enlai via Gong Peng, inviting him to Beijing to participate in the new Political Consultative Conference. He promptly returned to China with his family. Along with Wu Yaozong, Deng Yuzhi, Zhang Xueyan, and Zhao Zichen, Liu became a Christian representative in the Political Consultative Conference. Subsequently, Liu offered his position to an Islamic representative, changing to an alternate representative. During the conference, Liu and several representatives jointly proposed that ‚ÄúThe March of the Volunteers‚Äù be adopted as the national anthem, which was approved.</p>
<p>After returning to China, he became the director of the national council‚Äôs work group within the YMCA and participated in a Christian visitation team in North China, meeting with Zhou Enlai in May 1950. Within the Communist Party, Wu Yaozong‚Äôs initiated Three-Self Reform Declaration was referred to as the ‚ÄúWu-Liu Movement,‚Äù highlighting Liu‚Äôs involvement.</p>
<p>Liu Liangmo played a significant role in the Three-Self Reform Movement: he was an initiator of the reform declaration and a member of the presidium for the ‚Äúmeeting of Christian groups accepting U.S. subsidies.‚Äù As an executive committee member, he was also the leader of the propaganda group. In his role as head of propaganda, he became a key figure in advocating for the Christian accusation movement. In May 1951, he published an article in the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Daily‚Äù titled ‚ÄúHow to Hold a Church Complaint Meeting?‚Äù calling for local churches to understand that the purpose of the complaints was to eliminate imperialist influences within Christianity. The targets of the complaints were ‚Äúimperialist elements hidden within the church, their accomplices, and the failures of other churches.‚Äù He further provided guidance on organizing complaint meetings: first, establish a ‚ÄúComplaint Committee‚Äù to determine whom to accuse and who should be invited to testify; then hold mobilization meetings to instill the rationale and importance of why and what to accuse. Following this, accusation group meetings should be held in various churches and communities to identify the most effective accusers, inviting them to participate in the larger accusation meeting. He emphasized that during the preparation of complaints, guidance from the Religious Affairs Office was essential. In conjunction with the complaints, effective accusation statements could be published in local newspapers, and exhibitions could be held. Liu Liangmo‚Äôs guidance indeed became a reference model for various localities.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was an important theorist behind the ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù movement. In the early phase of the reform movement, he published several articles in ‚ÄúTianfeng,‚Äù focusing on points such as: (1) American imperialism‚Äôs use of Christianity to invade China; (2) Opposition to imperialism is not contradictory to patriotism; (3) Critiques of ‚Äúsuper-political‚Äù stances and ‚Äúexclusive love‚Äù ideologies.In January 1948, the Executive Yuan amended Article 7 to state: ‚ÄúNationals, companies, or churches from countries that have entered into equitable treaties with our country may apply for registration and reissuance of land ownership certificates for land acquired in the name of Chinese nationals prior to the treaty, provided they possess valid documentation proving their rights as genuine purchasers at the time of acquisition and are endorsed by their country‚Äôs consulate.‚Äù</p>

</ol>
<p>In September 1945, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China indicated in its ‚ÄúGuidance on the Work in Newly Liberated Cities‚Äù that ‚Äúthe rescue of allied prisoners and the protection of foreign nationals‚Ä¶ should not infringe upon religious organizations and charitable institutions, and we should strive not to commandeer schools‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>In February 1948, the Central Committee issued directives related to the treatment of foreigners, stating that ‚Äúin the newly occupied areas and cities, we will encounter more foreign expatriates and the churches, schools, hospitals, orphanages, and nursing homes established by them‚Ä¶ Generally, we will not adopt exclusionary or confiscatory policies toward these economic, cultural, and religious institutions established by foreign nationals, regardless of whether they belong to an imperialist nature.‚Äù It continued, ‚ÄúAs long as they acknowledge and comply with the laws and regulations of our democratic government and the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, they may be allowed to continue residing in our liberated areas, conduct business or other legitimate activities, and will be protected by our democratic government.‚Äù</p>
<p>Article 1 stated, ‚ÄúAny churches established by foreigners and the schools, hospitals, orphanages, and nursing homes they operate shall not be confiscated or destroyed after our army arrives. They are allowed to continue their activities as long as they comply with the laws of our armed forces and democratic government and do not engage in espionage or sabotage. Should any foreigners or agents entrusted by them flee, their properties will be put under government custody. However, the original organizers can return to take over. If these organizations have acquired land in rural areas or have occupied land, that land should be handled in accordance with land laws. However, any small gardens within the scope of these organizations should remain under their ownership, and property not attached to land should not be confiscated.‚Äù</p>
<p>Article 6 mentioned the need to ‚Äúidentify any imperialist elements among foreign nationals and pay attention to any conspiratorial sabotage actions‚Ä¶ When certain foreign missionaries engage in espionage or sabotage activities, we should not only detain and punish them but also gather sufficient evidence to publicize their misdeeds domestically and internationally, making a clear distinction between their criminal acts and legitimate religious activities. Those missionaries who are guilty should be prosecuted or expelled, but churches need not be closed. It is permissible for them to send other representatives to lead their churches to avoid misunderstandings by foreigners regarding our government‚Äôs stance on religion.‚Äù</p>
<p>In January 1949, the ‚ÄúGuidance on Foreign Affairs‚Äù issued by the Central Committee stated that ‚Äúin principle, the privileges of imperialism in China must be abolished and the independence of the Chinese nation must be realized, a position that is unwavering. However, in the execution steps, issues should be handled according to their nature and circumstances. Problems that are beneficial and resolvable for the Chinese people should be addressed. Those that remain unresolved should be deferred. Issues that are not significantly harmful or not considerably harmful to the Chinese people should not be rushed to resolve, even if they present easy solutions. Problems that have not been thoroughly studied or have not matured for resolution should also not be hastily approached.‚Äù Specifically regarding foreign missionaries, point 5 stated: ‚ÄúThose already in our liberated areas are allowed to continue residing and conducting their business, while newcomers are not permitted for the time being.‚Äù Point 6 concerning schools operated by foreigners specified: ‚ÄúExisting private foreign schools can maintain their status; their curricula must comply with the regulations applicable to other schools. New applications for establishment are denied.‚Äù Point 7 concerning hospitals operated by foreigners indicated: ‚ÄúExisting institutions may continue but will be subject to supervision and inspection. New establishments are not allowed without approval.‚Äù Point 10 regarding foreign charitable organizations specified: ‚ÄúThose belonging to imperialist governments‚Ä¶ should not be recognized, and their assistance and relief should be refused. Those belonging to international cooperative organizations should be evaluated based on whether they undermine our national sovereignty and the independence and autonomy of our populace before a decision is made to accept their aid.‚ÄùIn January 1948, the Executive Yuan amended Article 7 to state: ‚ÄúNationals, companies, or churches from countries that have entered into equitable treaties with our country may apply for registration and reissuance of land ownership certificates for land acquired in the name of Chinese nationals before the treaty, provided they possess valid documentation proving their rights as genuine purchasers at the time of acquisition and are endorsed by their country‚Äôs consulate.‚Äù</p>

Problems that have not been thoroughly researched or are not yet ripe for resolution should not be hastily addressed.‚Äù Specifically regarding foreign missionaries, point 5 stated: ‚ÄúThose already in our liberated areas are permitted to continue residing and conducting business, while newcomers are not permitted for now.‚Äù Point 6 concerning schools operated by foreigners specified: ‚ÄúExisting private foreign schools can maintain their status, and their curricula must comply with regulations applicable to other schools. New applications for establishment are denied.‚Äù Point 7, concerning hospitals operated by foreigners, indicated: ‚ÄúExisting institutions are allowed to continue but must be subject to our supervision and inspection. New establishments are not permitted without approval.‚Äù Point 10 concerning foreign charitable organizations specified: ‚ÄúThose associated with imperialist governments‚Ä¶ should not be recognized, and their assistance and relief should be refused. Those backed by international cooperative organizations should be evaluated based on whether they undermine our national sovereignty and the independence of our people before a decision can be made on whether to accept their assistance.‚Äù In January 1948, the Executive Yuan amended Article 7 to state: ‚ÄúNationals, companies, or churches from countries that have entered into equitable treaties with our country may apply for registration and reissuance of land ownership certificates for land acquired in the name of Chinese nationals before the treaty, provided they possess valid documentation proving their rights as genuine purchasers at the time of acquisition and are endorsed by their country‚Äôs consulate.‚Äù</p>

</ol>
<p>In September 1945, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China indicated in its ‚ÄúGuidance on Work in Newly Liberated Cities‚Äù that ‚Äúthe rescue of allied prisoners and the protection of foreign nationals‚Ä¶ should not infringe upon religious organizations and charitable institutions, and we should strive not to commandeer schools‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>In February 1948, the Central Committee issued directives regarding the treatment of foreigners, stating that ‚Äúin the newly occupied areas and cities, we will encounter more foreign expatriates and the churches, schools, hospitals, orphanages, and nursing homes established by them‚Ä¶ Generally, we will not adopt exclusionary or confiscatory policies regarding these economic, cultural, and religious institutions established by foreign nationals, regardless of whether they belong to an imperialist nature.‚Äù It continued, ‚ÄúAs long as they acknowledge and comply with the laws and regulations of our democratic government and the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, they may continue residing in our liberated areas, conduct business or other legitimate activities, and will be protected by our democratic government.‚Äù</p>
<p>Article 1 specified that ‚Äúchurches established by foreigners and the schools, hospitals, orphanages, and nursing homes they operate shall not be confiscated or destroyed after our army arrives. They are allowed to continue their work as long as they comply with the laws of our armed forces and democratic government and do not engage in espionage or sabotage. If any foreigners or their agents flee, their properties will be placed under government custody, but the original organizers can return to take over the administration. If land has been acquired in rural areas or has been taken by force, that land will be handled according to land laws, but any small gardens associated with these organizations must remain under their ownership, and any property not attached to land shall not be confiscated.‚Äù</p>
<p>Article 6 discussed the need to ‚Äúidentify certain imperialist elements among foreign nationals and pay attention to any conspiring actions‚Ä¶ If certain foreign missionaries engage in espionage or sabotage activities, we should detain them and gather sufficient evidence to publicize their actions, distinguishing between these criminal acts and legitimate religious activities. Guilty missionaries should face prosecution or expulsion, while the churches need not be closed. It is acceptable for them to appoint other representatives to lead their churches to prevent misunderstandings by foreigners regarding our government‚Äôs stance on religion.‚Äù</p>
<p>In January 1949, the ‚ÄúGuidance on Foreign Affairs‚Äù issued by the Central Committee stated that ‚Äúin principle, the privileges of imperialism in China must be abolished, and the independence of the Chinese nation must be realized, which is a steadfast position. However, actions should be handled according to the nature and circumstances of the issues. Problems that benefit the Chinese people and can be resolved should be addressed. Those that cannot be resolved should be postponed. Issues that are not harmful or present minimal harm to the Chinese people, even if easily resolved, need not be rushed into resolution. Problems that have not been thoroughly studied or are not yet ripe for resolution should also not be hastily approached.‚ÄùIn the winter of 1934, Liu Liangmo organized a mass singing event in the Shanghai YMCA, initiating the national salvation song movement and composing a song titled ‚ÄúSave China.‚Äù In 1935, he worked with Lu Gancheng, the general secretary of the Shanghai YMCA, to establish a singing team within the organization. In May, he recorded ‚ÄúThe March of the Volunteers‚Äù onto vinyl, which became an important piece for the singing group. When the ‚ÄúSeven Gentlemen,‚Äù including Shen Junru, were arrested by the government, Liu participated in their rescue efforts. In January 1936, the ‚ÄúShanghai United National Salvation Federation‚Äù was formed, with Liu as one of the 28 initiators. In May, the ‚ÄúNational United Salvation Federation‚Äù was established in Shanghai, and Liu served as a board member. During various activities organized by the federation, Liu Liangmo led the singing of ‚ÄúThe March of the Volunteers,‚Äù earning him the title of ‚Äúcheerleader for the Salvation Federation‚Äù from Shen Junru and others. In June 1936, during the first anniversary of the National United Salvation Federation, the mass singing event was held at the Shanghai Public Gymnasium, where Liu conducted from the stage.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1936, Liu traveled to the United States to attend the ‚ÄúWorld Student Christian Federation‚Äù conference held in San Francisco. Upon returning to China, he joined the YMCA‚Äôs Military Services Department and worked in several locations including Suiyuan, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, and Changsha to promote services for soldiers. During this time, he authored ‚ÄúThe ABCs of Mass Singing,‚Äù detailing how to teach the public to sing and organize community singing groups.</p>
<p>In 1939, while in Jinhua, Zhejiang, he met with Zhou Enlai. Later, Liu was briefly detained by the Nationalist Party in Ningbo under suspicions of being a Communist, but after being released, he applied to the YMCA to further his studies in the United States.</p>
<p>From the summer of 1940 until August 1949, Liu was primarily active in the United States, studying at Crozer Theological Seminary and the University of Pennsylvania. During this period, he promoted China‚Äôs anti-Japanese efforts and organized singing groups among the expatriate community. After the victory in the anti-Japanese war, he remained in the U.S., working to establish the American branch of the ‚ÄúChina Democratic League.‚Äù In September 1946, when Feng Yuxiang gave a lecture in the U.S., Liu served as his translator.</p>
<p>In August 1949, Liu Liangmo received a telegram from Zhou Enlai via Gong Peng, inviting him to Beijing to attend the new Political Consultative Conference. He immediately returned to China with his family. Along with Wu Yaozong, Deng Yuzhi, Zhang Xueyan, and Zhao Zichen, he became a Christian representative in the Political Consultative Conference. Later, Liu offered his position to an Islamic representative, becoming an alternate representative instead. During the conference, he and several other representatives jointly proposed to adopt ‚ÄúThe March of the Volunteers‚Äù as the national anthem, which was subsequently approved.</p>
<p>After returning to China, Liu served as the director of the national council‚Äôs work group within the YMCA and participated in a Christian visitation team in North China, meeting with Zhou Enlai in May 1950. Within the Communist Party, Wu Yaozong‚Äôs initiated Three-Self Reform Declaration was referred to as the ‚ÄúWu-Liu Movement,‚Äù highlighting Liu‚Äôs involvement.</p>
<p>Liu Liangmo played a pivotal role in the Three-Self Reform Movement, being an initiator of the reform declaration and a member of the presidium for the ‚Äúmeeting of Christian groups accepting U.S. subsidies.‚Äù As a key figure in the propaganda initiative, he was vital in promoting the Christian accusation movement. In May 1951, he published an article in the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Daily‚Äù titled ‚ÄúHow to Hold a Church Complaint Meeting?‚Äù urging local churches to understand that the purpose of the complaints was to eliminate imperialist influences within Christianity. The targets of the complaints focused on ‚Äúimperialist elements hidden within the church, their accomplices, and the failures of other churches.‚Äù He provided guidance on organizing complaint meetings: first, establish a ‚ÄúComplaint Committee‚Äù to determine whom to accuse and who should be invited to testify; then hold mobilization meetings to instill the rationale for the accusations. Following this, accusation group meetings should be held in various churches to identify the most effective accusers, inviting them to participate in a larger gathering. He emphasized that throughout the preparation process, guidance from the Religious Affairs Office was essential, and effective accusation statements should be published in local newspapers while organizing exhibitions. Liu Liangmo‚Äôs guidance became a reference model for various localities.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was a significant theorist of the ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù initiative. During the early phase of the reform movement, he published several articles in ‚ÄúTianfeng,‚Äù focusing on points such as: (1) American imperialism‚Äôs use of Christianity to invade China; (2) Opposition to imperialism is not contradictory to patriotism; (3) Critiques of ‚Äúsuper-political‚Äù stances and ‚Äúexclusive love‚Äù ideologies.</p>

<p>Liu Liangmo‚Äôs journey reflects the complex interplay of religious faith, political ideals, and cultural movements during a tumultuous period in Chinese history. His commitment to both his faith and his nation showcases his adaptability and dedication, highlighting his significant influence on the Christian community in China.Tu Yuqing (Y. C. Tu, 1895-1975) was born in Hubei HanYang and came from a Christian family, having been baptized at a young age. His grandfather, Tu Songshan, was a minister in the Methodist Church. During his primary and junior high school years, he studied in church schools in HanYang. In 1906, he attended Bowun Academy in Wuchang. After graduating in 1912, he stayed on as an English teacher. In 1913, he entered Tsinghua School and the following year went to the United States. He studied at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for civil engineering, and Columbia University for business, receiving his master‚Äôs degree in 1918. Upon returning to China in 1919, he taught at Nanjing Higher Normal School and Southeast University (the precursor of Central University).</p>
<p>After the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, the government decided to build the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. Tu collaborated with other engineers on constructing the tree-lined avenue leading to the mausoleum.</p>
<p>In 1927, he began teaching at Soochow University. In 1930, he received a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship and resumed studies in the United States at the University of Chicago, focusing on atomic physics. He earned a PhD in physics in 1932 and returned to continue teaching at Soochow University, eventually serving as the head of the physics department.</p>
<p>Liu Liangmo later played a key role in various national movements, including the national salvation movement. In 1939, he held the position of secretary for the Shanghai chapter of the YMCA and later worked to strengthen the organization‚Äôs outreach and community services during the war period.</p>
<p>In 1951, Tu Yuqing joined the Christian Youth Association, where he continued to be active in educational and religious activities. However, as the political landscape in China changed, he became involved in the three-self reform movement initiated by Wu Yaozong, becoming a significant figure in this transition. Despite facing considerable challenges during the Cultural Revolution, Tu remained an influential figure within the Chinese Christian community.</p>
<p>Finally, he passed away in September 1975 due to health complications after enduring years of political strife.</p>

</ol>
<p>Xie Fuya (N. Z. Xie, 1902-1992), originally from Zhejiang, was actively involved in the Christian movements during a tumultuous era in China. His experiences reflect the struggles and adaptations of the church under the changing political context of the time.Zia (Nai Zin Zia, 1892-1991) was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. His English name was derived from his time studying in Japan, where he was known as ‚ÄúNai Rin.‚Äù He received traditional education from a young age and went to Japan to study in 1911. In 1914, he enrolled in Tokyo Higher Normal School on a government scholarship but was expelled due to health issues. The following year, he transferred to Rikkyo University, where he became a Christian and was baptized at the Anglican Trinity Church in 1916. Due to ongoing health problems, he was unable to complete his studies and returned to China.</p>
<p>Starting in the fall of 1916, Zia worked in the publications department of the National Christian Council YMCA, and in 1918 he was transferred to the general affairs department as a clerk, serving as the Chinese assistant to General Secretary Yu Rizhzhang. Between 1925 and 1927, he was sponsored by the YMCA to study in the United States at the University of Chicago and Harvard University. After returning to China, he taught at Lingnan University and became active in Christian publishing, producing various works. In 1934, he resigned from his position at Lingnan to participate in the educational work of the People‚Äôs Education Promotion Association. He returned to Lingnan University in 1939, and in 1940 he became the dean of the College of Arts at Sun Yat-sen University. The following year, he served as director of the Civic Education Office at Hunan National Normal University. In 1943, he taught in the Chinese Literature Department at Soochow University. In 1945, he taught at the Guangxi Xijiang Institute. In 1946, he moved to Nanjing to teach at Jinling University, and in 1948, he returned to Hunan as the president of the National Normal University before eventually fleeing south to Lingnan University in Guangzhou due to the war.</p>
<p>In July 1949, Zia left Guangzhou for the British colony of Hong Kong to escape the turmoil. He described this as ‚Äúfleeing for his life‚Äù and stated that he ‚Äúhad to rush to an unwelcome foreign colony.‚Äù He later taught at Chung Chi College and Baptist College in Hong Kong and left for the United States in April 1958, facilitated by Francis P. Jones, a Methodist missionary who had previously taught at Jinling University in Nanjing. During his time in Hong Kong, Zia focused on the relationship between Christianity and Confucianism, contemplating the renewal of Chinese culture and ultimately promoting the construction of ‚ÄúChinese Christianity.‚Äù Simultaneously, he reflected on the sociopolitical issues in Hong Kong and Taiwan amidst his displacement.</p>
<p>Zia‚Äôs relocation to the United States in 1958 was organized by Jones, where he participated in the compilation of ‚ÄúA Collection of Christian Classics Through the Ages.‚Äù In 1984, he was invited to visit China by Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou and ultimately settled there in 1986, where he lived until his passing in 1991.</p>

<p>Chinese Christian Population (Ying 2009: 65, 75-78)</p>
<p>In 1949, the National Christian Council conducted a nationwide survey regarding the number of Chinese Christians. Although the data was incomplete, it remains of some authority. The survey was coordinated by Áï¢ÁØÑÂÆá (Frank W. Price), initially published in early October 1949, and then reissued in January 1950, both as mimeographed trial editions, with no differences between the two. In December 1950, the council published a revised letterpress edition. Comparing the two, the January edition reported a total of 792,862 church members (across 18 denominations), while the December edition reported 902,805 (across 21 denominations). At the same time, the council also compiled ‚ÄúA Brief Compilation of Chinese Christian Denominations 1949-1950‚Äù (manuscript), which included statistical data from various denominations. The ‚ÄúCompilation‚Äù recorded numbers for several denominations that were not noted in the ‚ÄúSurvey,‚Äù totaling 1,031,021 church members across these denominations. It can be said that the ‚ÄúSurvey‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCompilation‚Äù provided data on the number of Chinese Christians and their denominational distribution before and after the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. However, due to the inconsistency of the reporting years from various denominations (for example, ÂÜÖÂú∞‰ºö provided data from 1934), and because the enumeration of denominations was not comprehensive, the actual number of Christians should exceed one million.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the State Council required church groups to register. According to statistics from the Religious Affairs Bureau, in 1950 the total number of believers from 22 different Christian denominations across the country was 1,005,699. In fact, some denominations submitted numbers to the State Council that matched those in the ‚ÄúCompilation‚Äù and ‚ÄúSurvey,‚Äù but additionally included member counts from Christian meeting halls and spiritual service groups. A comparison shows that the member counts for most denominations were the same, reflecting that these denominations had only submitted their old records during registration. It is noteworthy that the records from the State Council included numbers for local sects such as Âü∫Áù£ÂæíËÅöÊúÉËôï, ÁúüËÄ∂Á©åÊïôÊúÉ, ËÄ∂Á©åÂÆ∂Â∫≠, and Ëá™Á´ãÊúÉ, which not only help us understand the situation of these local sects but also provide a more comprehensive grasp of the total number of Chinese Christians. In any case, it is generally regarded that the number of Christians in the early days of the new China is 700,000, a figure that warrants revision.Denominations</p>

<li>Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Christian Anti-American Aid to Korea Three-Self Reform Movement 1951 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 1996: 55-62; ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2012b: 58-64; ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2023: 119-120)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the Chinese Communist Party intervened in the Korean War, on December 16, 1950, the U.S. government announced the control of properties in territories it governed in China and North Korea, as well as prohibiting vessels from the U.S. from sailing to Chinese ports. In light of the U.S. freezing of Chinese public and private properties in the U.S., the Central People‚Äôs Government State Council also issued an order on December 28 to control American properties in China and freeze U.S. public and private deposits in China. This action severely impacted missionary work in China, which still relied on American funds for sustenance. On December 29, the State Council announced decisions on handling cultural, educational, and relief institutions, as well as religious groups receiving U.S. subsidies, which stated that ‚ÄúChinese religious groups accepting American subsidies should be transformed into organizations completely independent and self-managed by Chinese Christians. The government encourages their self-sustaining movements.‚Äù</p>
<p>From April 16 to 21, 1951, the Religious Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and Education of the Central People‚Äôs Government convened a ‚ÄúConference on Handling Christian Groups Accepting American Subsidies‚Äù in Beijing. The purpose of this government-convened meeting was to seek ‚Äúto finally, thoroughly, permanently, and completely end more than a century of cultural aggression by American imperialism against the Chinese people under the leadership of the Central People‚Äôs Government.‚ÄùThe conference was convened under the name of ‚ÄúConference on Handling Christian Groups Accepting American Subsidies,‚Äù but in essence, it was not merely addressing these ‚Äútechnical‚Äù issues. A comprehensive view of the meeting‚Äôs content reveals that the core topic was how to accelerate severing the ties between Christianity and imperialism and to initiate a ‚Äústruggle‚Äù between the church and American imperialism. As noted by Èô∏ÂÆö‰∏Ä (Lu Dingyi), deputy director of the Ministry of Culture and Education of the State Council, at the meeting: ‚ÄúHandling Christian groups that accept American subsidies is not a technical issue; it is a struggle. The goal of this struggle is to thoroughly eliminate the influence of over a hundred years of American imperialism‚Äôs cultural aggression against our country.‚Äù Moreover, American cultural aggression is not just a historical issue; it is a current reality that continues to manifest through Christianity.</p>
<p>As a result, over 150 church representatives from across the country, including many self-governing churches unrelated to Western denominations, such as Êï¨Â•†ÁÄõ (Jesus Family), ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ (Christian Meeting Place), and È≠è‰ª•Êíí (True Jesus Church), passed the ‚ÄúProcedures for Handling Christian Groups Accepting American Subsidies‚Äù and the ‚ÄúJoint Declaration of Representatives from Various Chinese Christian Churches and Organizations.‚Äù At the same time, to more comprehensively promote the Christian reform movement and lead Chinese churches to undertake the task of building a new China, the Beijing conference decided to establish a new organization‚Äîthe ‚ÄúPreparatory Committee for the Chinese Christian Anti-American Aid to Korea Three-Self Reform Movement,‚Äù specifically responsible for coordinating Christian reform efforts, with Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó as the chairman of the preparatory committee. All Christian groups and denominations, including the council, were expected to undertake learning and reform under the guidance of the reform preparatory committee.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Three-Self Reform Preparatory Committee not only targeted reforms within Christianity but also reflected the CCP‚Äôs attempt to establish patriotic religious groups across major religions, thereby achieving unified leadership in the religious sphere. In the 1950s, various religions subsequently established patriotic religious groups supported by the party state: the ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰ΩõÊïôÂçè‰ºö (Chinese Buddhist Association, 1953), the ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰ºäÊñØÂÖ∞ÊïôÂçè‰ºö (Chinese Islamic Association, 1953), the ‰∏≠ÂõΩÈÅìÊïôÂçè‰ºö (Chinese Taoist Association, 1957), and the ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ§©‰∏ªÊïôÊïôÂèãÁà±ÂõΩ‰ºö (Patriotic Catholic Association, 1957).</p>

<li>ÈáëÈôµÂçîÂíåÁ•ûÂ≠∏Èô¢ (Jinling Union Theological Seminary) 1953 (ÂæêÂ¶ÇÈõ∑ 2022: 244-248; Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© 2013: 1-2)</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of 1950, after China intervened in the Korean War, Sino-U.S. relations were completely broken, and the Chinese government announced a freeze on all U.S. assets in China. The economic aid that Christian missionary work had traditionally relied upon was thus interrupted, leading various seminaries to the brink of closure. In 1951, to reduce expenses, Jinling Theological Seminary merged with Jinling Women‚Äôs Theological Seminary, setting a precedent for institutional consolidation.</p>
<p>In August 1952, a theological education symposium was held in Shanghai in the East China region, where it was decided to establish a preparatory committee for the East China United Theological Seminary. In November, Jinling Union Theological Seminary was officially established in Nanjing, formed by the union of 11 seminaries in the East China region: Shanghai Anglican Central Theological Seminary, Shanghai Baptist Theological Seminary, Hangzhou Chinese Theological Seminary, Nanjing Jinling Theological Seminary (which included Jinling Women‚Äôs Theological Seminary), Wuxi North China Theological Seminary, Jinan Qilu Theological Seminary, Zhangzhou Minnan Theological Seminary, Fuzhou Union Theological Seminary, Ningbo Trinity Bible Institute, Zhenjiang Baptist Bible Institute, and Jinan Mingdao Bible Institute.</p>
<p>The 11 seminaries included both seminaries under church universities and those jointly run by denominations, as well as independent seminaries. In terms of theological positions, they encompassed both fundamentalist traditions and those leaning towards modernist theologians. At that time, in order to prevent faith from being influenced, representatives of the fundamentalist faction suggested merging into two seminaries‚Äîmodernists uniting at Nanjing Jinling Theological Seminary and fundamentalists at Wuxi North China Theological Seminary, leading to a stalemate in opinions at the conference. ÁΩóÁ´πÈ£é (Luo Zhufeng), head of the East China Religious Affairs Bureau, stated: ‚ÄúUnder the premise of anti-imperialism and patriotism, any theological thought has the freedom to exist, and the government will not interfere. Various theological thoughts in China cannot be considered to have a singular authority. In other words, since religious belief is free, our theological thoughts must also be free.‚Äù The principle of mutual respect at Jinling Union Theological Seminary emerged from this line of thinking. The school‚Äôs guiding principles were four ‚Äúcornerstones of faith‚Äù: ‚Äú1. The entire Bible is God‚Äôs revelation, including all essential doctrines concerning salvation, serving as the foundation for believers‚Äô faith and moral conduct. 2. The one God is the source of all things and the Father of humanity, full of justice and love. 3. Jesus Christ is the Holy Son of God, who became flesh to redeem mankind, was crucified, resurrected from the dead, and is the head of the church, the Savior of all ages. 4. The Holy Spirit is one of the Trinity, working in regeneration and sanctification, bestowing various gifts to believers in the church.‚Äù Note that all four points are listed as ‚Äú1,‚Äù without any order of precedence.</p>
<p>To accommodate different theological traditions, Jinling Union Theological Seminary adopted the principle of ‚Äúmutual respect‚Äù in its early years.Among the more than 30 faculty members at Jinling Union Theological Seminary, one-third came from a fundamentalist background, while over 60% of the more than 100 students adhered to fundamentalist traditions. Balancing the debates between ‚Äúmodernists‚Äù and ‚Äúfundamentalists‚Äù became a crucial issue that the seminary had to address. At that time, the Jinling Education Office stipulated that certain courses within theology and biblical studies be divided into classes based on either ‚Äúmodernist‚Äù or ‚Äúfundamentalist‚Äù viewpoints, with no directives for a ‚Äúunified faith.‚Äù</p>
<p>Between 1957 and 1959, the China Spiritual Seminary, Chongqing Theological Seminary, and Guangzhou Union Theological Seminary merged into Jinling Union Theological Seminary. The Chongqing Theological Seminary and China Spiritual Seminary were respectively administered by ÈôàÂ¥áÊ°Ç (Chen Chonggui) and Ë¥æÁéâÈì≠ (Jia Yuming), who had spiritual backgrounds. Their participation in the Three-Self Movement was believed to be based on considerations of unifying the spiritual faction, allowing them to operate independently. However, following the Anti-Rightist Movement, the spiritual faction was largely purged from the Three-Self organizations. Chen Chonggui was labeled a rightist, and Jia Yuming was also marked as part of the inner party, resulting in the merging of both spiritually inclined seminaries into Jinling Union Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>In 1961, Yenching Union Theological Seminary was further merged into Jinling, making Jinling the only theological seminary in the country, which resumed classes in April 1961. However, due to the severe impact of the Great Leap Forward on religious activities, Jinling could only offer continuing education programs for pastoral coworkers. By 1962, undergraduate courses were reinstated. Nevertheless, starting in 1962, the seminary was influenced by the ‚ÄúFour Clean-Ups‚Äù Movement (which aimed to clean politics, the economy, organizations, and thoughts), leading to a suspension of new student admissions. In 1966, with the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution, the last remaining seminary established a command center for the Red Guards, and the seminary was forced to close, plunging Chinese theological education into a dark period lasting over a decade.</p>

</ol>
<p>In December 1950, the United States announced the freezing of all Chinese assets in America, and numerous educational, charitable, cultural, and religious organizations that relied heavily on American subsidies faced an immediate financial crisis. On January 15, 1951, the Ministry of Education held a meeting for higher education institutions receiving foreign subsidies, where Minister È©¨Âèô‰º¶ (Ma Xulun) pointed out that church schools were significant activities in American imperialism‚Äôs cultural aggression. In response to the U.S. freeze on Chinese assets, the State Council decided to take over educational sovereignty, converting the previously subsidized higher education institutions into schools run by the Chinese people themselves. After the meeting, the Ministry of Education of the Central People‚Äôs Government and the Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee announced the takeover of Union Medical College and Yenching University. On February 12, Yenching University was officially taken over by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>With the freezing of U.S. funds, Yenching University suddenly lost all subsidies. As Yenching University was taken over by the government, the future of the religious school came under scrutiny. President ÈôÜÂøóÈü¶ (Lu Zhiwei) suggested reorganizing the religious school to become an academic research institution for various Chinese religions, thus allowing the government to permit it to function as a department within the university. However,Èô¢ÈïøËµµÁ¥´ÂÆ∏ (Zhao Zichen) preferred to separate the university from the religious school, stating that the only way forward after separation would be ‚Äúto let the church support itself.‚Äù To this end, Zhao convened a meeting of all faculty and students and invited some alumni in Beijing to participate in the discussion. A few days later, Zhao drafted a document titled ‚ÄúThe Future Direction of Yenching Religious Academy,‚Äù proposing to rename the religious academy as Yenching Religious Academy, register it with the Beijing municipal government, and request approval from the Ministry of Education to become a private religious academy.</p>
<p>After the government took over Yenching University, it immediately launched a patriotic education campaign, organizing seminars and denunciation meetings aimed at purging the harmful effects of American cultural aggression. Starting in July 1951, the religious academy at Yenching University also began learning research and engaged in criticism and self-criticism. After several months of study, the Beijing Religious Affairs Bureau planned to hold a meeting at the religious academy to denounce American imperialism‚Äôs use of religion as a means of aggression. The denunciation meeting was held on November 24, lasting the entire day, during which Zhao Zichen made accusations.</p>
<p>During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP dispatched a ‚Äúwork team‚Äù to Yenching University in December 1951 to lead the movement. The president was sidelined, and classes were suspended to carry out the movement. Although the religious academy had already separated from the university, the discipline inspection committee of Yenching University still centrally directed the religious academy‚Äôs activities. In early March 1952, Zhao Zichen, as the head of the religious academy, was subjected to two rounds of accusations from the entire school, requiring him to conduct a thorough self-examination. Ultimately, Zhao was deemed to have a ‚Äústubborn‚Äù attitude and was removed from his position as president in March due to accusations from the ‚ÄúEconomy Inspection Committee,‚Äù including ‚Äúusing religion to organize and systematically spread toxins that undermine the new China; serving as one of the heads of reactionary religious groups worldwide; and, as a representative in the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference, appearing to comply with government policies while actually opposing them.‚Äù As a result, he ‚Äúaccepted the demands of the masses‚Äù and had his position terminated, with ËíãÁøºÊåØ (Jiang Yizhen) serving as the acting head.In May 1952, the movement was declared concluded. In November, the religious academy moved away from Yanyuan. As early as May 1952, Yenching Religious Academy, Beijing Theological Seminary, and Union Women‚Äôs Theological College began preliminary discussions about merging the three institutions and negotiated unification in August. In April 1953, the three seminaries officially merged to form ‚ÄúYenching Union Theological Seminary,‚Äù with Áéã‰ª≤Ê¢ì (Wang Zhongzi) and ËíãÁøºÊåØ (Jiang Yizhen) serving as the chair and vice-chair of the administrative committee, respectively. In September, the Far East Missionary Alliance Holiness Bible College, Shenyang Northeast Theological Seminary, and Henan Kaifeng Huanei Baptist Theological Seminary also merged into Yenching. Between 1954 and 1956, Hubei Lankou Lutheran Theological Seminary, Hunan Bible College, Beijing Assembly of God Truth College, Central China Union Theological Seminary, and Beijing Xiangshan Spiritual Institute joined in succession.</p>

<li>China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee 1954 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2010: 111-116)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the establishment of the Three-Self Reform Preparatory Committee in April 1951, nearly three years of efforts were still met with rejection from certain spiritual faction churches citing ‚Äúdifferent beliefs‚Äù and ‚Äúreforming faith.‚Äù The impact of churches such as Christian Meeting Place and the church of ÁéãÊòéÈÅì (Wang Mingdao) was particularly significant. Strengthening and expanding the unity among Chinese Christians under the overarching principle of ‚ÄúThree-Self Reform‚Äù became an important issue that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>From November 27 to December 16, 1953, the Second National Religious Work Conference was held in Beijing. The conference was presided over by ‰π†‰ª≤Âãã (Xi Zhongxun), Minister of the Central Propaganda Department and Deputy Director of the Ministry of Culture and Education, and ÈôÜÂÆö‰∏Ä (Lu Dingyi), Deputy Director of the Ministry of Culture and Education, summarizing the Christian work from 1950 to 1953 and formulating future work guidelines. According to the meeting documents, to ‚Äúimplement the patriotic reform movement,‚Äù the future work‚Äôs focus would be ‚Äúto gain the broad support of devout believers while also winning over the majority of pastoral staff.‚Äù This way, it would be possible to ‚Äúexpand the China Christian Three-Self Reform Preparatory Committee as a leading organization by more comprehensively including representative upper leaders from the churches, making it a genuine patriotic united front organization for all Christian denominations in the country.‚Äù To achieve this goal, it was emphasized that the slogan should focus on ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù and not emphasize the slogans of ‚ÄúThree-Self‚Äù or ‚Äúreform,‚Äù and that a formal organization should be established in the first half of 1954, possibly using the name ‚ÄúChristian Patriotic Association.‚Äù To unite more believers, patriotic reform organizations and active patriots must genuinely ‚Äúcare for the religious lives of believers,‚Äù as a fundamental means of connecting with the laity and a major condition for religious mass work.</p>
<p>From May 17 to 22, 1954, the Three-Self Reform Preparatory Committee held its second plenary meeting, attended by the heads of the Central Religious Affairs Bureau, ‰ΩïÊàêÊπò (He Chengxiang), ÁΩóÁ´πÈ£é (Luo Zhufeng), and ‰∏äÊµ∑ÂÆóÊïô‰∫ãÂä°Â§Ñ (Shanghai Religious Affairs Bureau) director Èôà‰∏ÄÈ∏£ (Chen Yiming). The meeting decided to convene a national Christian conference in Beijing in the second half of the year and to establish a ‚Äúformal leading organization.‚Äù Clearly, the national Christian conference was convened primarily under the directives of the Central Committee‚Äôs Christian work, with the goals of ‚Äúgreat unity‚Äù and the name of the new organization set in accordance with the CCP‚Äôs evaluation of the Christian reform movement. The party state was not satisfied with only individual denominational churches participating in the Three-Self Reform, and resolving the resistance from influential spiritual factions to the movement became a focal point of Christian work.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1954 National Christian Conference, the preparatory office extended invitations to representatives of the spiritual factions. The conference secretary general Ê≤àÂæ∑Ê∫∂ (Shen Derong) pointed out that to ‚Äúfurther expand the anti-imperialist patriotic unity of Chinese Christianity,‚Äù it was decided to invite ‚Äúrepresentatives from certain denominations and groups that have not participated or actively oppose the China Christian Three-Self Reform Movement.‚Äù In the end, 27 representatives from spiritual factions participated in the Three-Self Conference for the first time, with 15 from Shanghai alone. However, due to the boycott by ÁéãÊòéÈÅì and other spiritual factions, five invited representatives from Beijing declined to attend.</p>
<p>From July 22 to August 6, 1954, the China Christian National Conference was held in Beijing. Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó (Wu Yaozong) suggested that for the sake of unity, the name of the formally established leading organization be changed from the previously used ‚ÄúChristian Three-Self Reform Movement‚Äù to ‚ÄúChristian Three-Self Patriotic Movement.‚Äù This was because the term ‚Äúreform‚Äù easily evoked associations with historical religious reform movements in the church. ‚ÄúSome comrades mistakenly believe that ‚Äòreform‚Äô means ‚Äòto abolish the church‚Äôs system‚Äô; others fear that ‚Äòreform‚Äô may interfere with their own beliefs, thus adopting a passive observation stance towards the Three-Self Reform Movement.‚Äù Therefore, the renaming of the ‚ÄúChristian Three-Self Patriotic Movement‚Äù would help eliminate factors that hinder church unity. He even emphasized that the Three-Self Patriotic Movement would become ‚Äúa movement for all Chinese believers, a great unity of all Chinese believers.‚Äù‚ÄúAny denomination, any church and believer with differing beliefs should work together on the basis of patriotism and love for their faith to contribute the greatest strength to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.‚Äù During the National Christian Conference, ‰ΩïÊàêÊπò (He Chengxiang), Director of the Central Religious Affairs Bureau, criticized those who refused to participate in the patriotic movement citing ‚Äúdifferent beliefs,‚Äù but he still hoped that the spiritual factions could return to a common foundation of patriotism.</p>
<p>The chairman of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó (Wu Yaozong), with ÊùéÂÑ≤Êñá (Li Chuwen) serving as the secretary-general. The conference passed the ‚ÄúLetter to All National Colleagues,‚Äù reaffirming that ‚Äúwe understand that the purpose of self-governance is not to unify or alter the church‚Äôs systems, but to completely sever ties with imperialism, allowing Chinese Christians to unite and manage their own churches; self-supporting does not interfere with each church‚Äôs economy but aims for each church to entirely cut off its economic connections with imperialism and be fully responsible to Chinese believers; and self-propagating is not about unifying beliefs or altering faith, but about thoroughly purging the remnants of imperialist ideological influence so that each church preaches the pure gospel consistent with the Bible. As for the differences in faith, systems, and rituals among churches, we should mutually respect one another.‚Äù This can be seen as a response to the spiritual factions.</p>

<li>Christian Joint Publishing Bureau 1956 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2012b: 228-232, 239-260)</li>
</ol>
<p>According to a survey by the China Christian Council in 1950, the national Christian publishing institutions included: ‰∏≠ËèØ‰ø°Áæ©Êõ∏Â†±ÈÉ® (Chinese Lutheran Press), ‰∏≠ËèØÊµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉÊõ∏Â±Ä (Chinese Baptist Publishing House), ‰∏≠ËèØÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂá∫ÁâàÂçîÊúÉ (Chinese Christian Publishing Association), ‰∏≠ÂúãÂü∫Áù£ÊïôËÅñÊïôÊõ∏ÊúÉ (Chinese Christian Sacred Book Society), Â§©È¢®Á§æ (Heavenly Wind Society), Áî∞ÂÆ∂ÂçäÊúàÂàä (Tianjia Biweekly), ÈùíÂπ¥ÂçîÊúÉÊõ∏Â±Ä (Youth Association Publishing House), ÂÆ£ÈÅìÊõ∏Â±Ä (Evangelical Publishing House), ÊôÇÂÖÜÂ†±È§® (Shizhao Press), ËèØËã±Êõ∏Â±Ä (Huaying Publishing House), Âª£ÂçîÊõ∏Â±Ä (Guangxie Publishing House), Âª£Â≠∏ÊúÉ (Guangxue Society), Èùà‰øÆÊó•Á®ãÁ§æ (Spiritual Calendar Society), Èñ©ÂåóÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÊúÉÊõ∏Â±Ä (Northern Min Christian Church Publishing House), ‰∏≠ËèØËÅñÂÖ¨ÊúÉ‰∏≠Â§ÆËæ¶‰∫ãËôïÊõ∏ÂÆ§ (Central Office of the Chinese Anglican Church Publishing House), ‰∏äÊµ∑Á¶èÈü≥Âª£Êí≠ÈõªÂè∞ (Shanghai Gospel Radio Station), and others totaling 17 institutions.</p>
<p>In January 1951, the East China Military and Political Committee required all Christian publishing establishments receiving foreign subsidies to register with relevant authorities. In the new context of the Korean War, the Christian publishing industry faced severe challenges. On March 16, a Christian publishing conference was held in Beijing to assist the Christian publishing sector in overcoming the difficulties arising from the cessation of U.S. funds after the outbreak of the Korean War, and to discuss how to sever ties with imperialism and eliminate its influence. The conference decided that the Christian Publishing Association would be responsible for book reviews, providing feedback to various publishing units to remove the influence of imperialism. Additionally, it proposed a unified operation of the Christian publishing sector, aiming to establish a joint distribution entity.</p>
<p>After the publishing conference, the association pushed for the establishment of Christian joint bookstores. Between March and June 1951, the association convened two discussions with Christian publishing institutions in Shanghai and consulted various organizations across the nation. It is noteworthy that the responses were ‚Äúprincipally supportive, though there were some considerations regarding actual participation conditions,‚Äù reflecting some resistance from existing publishing institutions toward the unification proposal. The earliest supporters were only Guangxue Society, Youth Association Publishing House, and Baptist Bookstore, which sent representatives (Âê¥ËÄÄÂÆó, Âº†‰ªïÁ´†, ËÉ°Á•ñËî≠, Âº†‰ªÅÈïú, ÈáëÁÇéÈùí, and Âº†‰ºØÊÄÄ) to form a preparatory committee, deciding to first establish a central joint entity in Shanghai. However, further achieving the merger of the various Christian publishing institutions involved more complex issues, with the willingness of independent publishing entities to yield and submit to the leadership of the Christian Publishing Association being a primary concern.</p>
<p>Between 1952 and 1953, fewer than 10 publishing entities continued to operate, collectively publishing 44 Christian works, reflecting serious setbacks in the Christian publishing industry under political pressure. In 1953, the Christian Publishing Association ended itself due to a lack of necessity for continuation. Four entities, including the Guangxue Society, Chinese Baptist Publishing House, Youth Association National Council Publishing Department, and China Sunday School Alliance, formed a united editorial committee in 1953 according to the spirit of the Christian publishing conference as the first step towards unification. The united editorial committee consisted of the main editorial staff from the four entities, with Ê≤àÂæ∑Ê∫∂ (Shen Derong) serving as executive secretary to coordinate the publication plans, while the actual publishing responsibilities remained with the respective entities. This indicates that the Three-Self Reform organization had begun to manage and coordinate the reform plans for Christian publishing. In 1954 and 1955, the Guangxue Society, Chinese Baptist Publishing House, Youth Association Publishing House, and China Sunday School Alliance collaborated on editorial work and published three titles under the Guangxue Society, including two volumes of ‚ÄúNew Sermon Collections‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Life and Teachings of Prophet Jeremiah‚Äù (by ÊùéÊ¶ÆËä≥). Meanwhile, various publishing houses still published over 30 works under their independent names.In December 1956, the Christianity Joint Publishing Bureau was formed through the alliance of the Guangxue Society, Chinese Baptist Publishing House, China Sunday School Alliance, and Youth Association Publishing House, with Ê±üÊñáÊº¢ (Jiang Wenhan) serving as the general secretary. The establishment of the Christianity Joint Publishing Bureau marked the formal entry of the Christian publishing industry into an era of ‚Äúunification.‚Äù After its establishment, the Joint Publishing Bureau published a total of 13 books in 1957. However, following the Anti-Rightist Movement, the work of the Christianity Joint Publishing Bureau faced unprecedented challenges. By the 1960s, there were no more advertisements for new book publications in the magazine Â§©È¢® (Tianfeng), reflecting a halt in the publishing activities of the Joint Publishing Bureau. During the Cultural Revolution, with the cessation of the Three-Self organizations, the Joint Publishing Bureau also faced a similar fate of closure.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the central government began to address the system of theological education in China, primarily through unification efforts. Utilizing the funding disruption post-Korean War, several seminaries were merged into three ‚Äúunified‚Äù seminaries: Jinling Union Theological Seminary (Nanjing), Yenching Union Theological Seminary (Beijing), and Guangzhou Union Theological Seminary (Guangzhou). By 1956, these three unifying seminaries had merged over 30 seminaries from various regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, outside of these three ‚Äúunified‚Äù seminaries, there were still some individual seminaries that managed to persist. The first category was seminaries run by spiritual factions that joined the Three-Self Movement: besides the influential ÈáçÂ∫ÜÁ•ûÂ≠¶Èô¢ (Chongqing Theological Seminary) led by ÈôàÂ¥áÊ°Ç (Chen Chonggui) and Ë¥æÁéâÈì≠ (Jia Yuming), there was also the Huai‚Äôen Amateur Theological Seminary established by ÊàöÂ∫ÜÊâç (Qi Qingcai) at the Baptist Church. The second category consisted of independent seminaries run by individuals from the spiritual faction. Due to reservations regarding the Three-Self Movement, these seminaries continued to operate independently. Though smaller in scale and unconnected to larger organizations, they relied mainly on faith-based contributions, enabling them to survive even after the ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù Examples include the Âåó‰∫¨È¶ôÂ±±ÁÅµ‰øÆÈô¢ (Beijing Xiangshan Spiritual Institute) led by ÊØïÂíèÁê¥ (Bi Yongqin), the ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰º†ÈÅì‰∫∫‰øÆÂÖªÈô¢ (China Christian Worker‚Äôs Home, led by ÁÑ¶Áª¥Áúü), and the Âú£ÁªèÂ≠¶Á§æ (Bible Society) in Shanghai.</p>
<p>During the 1954 National Christian Conference, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was established, aimed at encouraging the participation of the spiritual faction in the Three-Self Movement. ÁÑ¶Áª¥Áúü attended the conference, while ÊØïÂíèÁê¥ refused to do so. However, after the arrest of the anti-Three-Self activist ÁéãÊòéÈÅì in 1955, many within the spiritual faction, including ÊØïÂíèÁê¥, decided to join the Three-Self Movement, likely with the intention of fostering unity among spiritual factions. The China Christian Worker‚Äôs Home, Huai‚Äôen Amateur Theological Seminary, and Bible Society did not merge into Jinling or Yenching Union Theological Seminaries but instead cooperated with Ë¥æÁéâÈì≠‚Äôs China Christian Spiritual Theological Seminary to form the ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂü∫Áù£Êïô‰∏äÊµ∑ÁÅµ‰øÆÁ•ûÂ≠¶Èô¢ (China Christian Shanghai Spiritual Theological Seminary), with Ë¥æÁéâÈì≠ as its president, and ÁÑ¶Áª¥Áúü, ÊàöÂ∫ÜÊâç, and Êù®ÁªçÂîê (Yang Shaotang) as vice presidents, and Á´∫ËßÑË∫´ (Zhu Guishen) as the chairman of the board. The seminary aimed to emphasize ‚Äúthis collaboration is centered on Christ, pooling the strength of each body to cultivate holy workers who love their country and church in the new China.‚Äù Its educational policy prioritized ‚Äúspiritual life and consistent biblical knowledge, aiming for students to achieve a correct balance in faith and life, knowledge and experience, so they may be useful to the Lord in building the church in the new China.‚Äù</p>
<p>In October 1956, the seminary held a founding ceremony where Ë¥æÁéâÈì≠ stated: ‚Äú‚ÄòChina Christianity‚Äô is our target audience, ‚ÄòShanghai‚Äô is the location of the seminary, ‚ÄòSpirituality‚Äô indicates our focus on experiential faith and abundant life, while ‚ÄòTheological Seminary‚Äô signifies our dedication to the study of biblical truth and theological knowledge.‚Äù The seminary hoped to concentrate its efforts on cultivating ‚Äúholy workers‚Äù who met the needs of the times.</p>
<p>However, following the onset of the Anti-Rightist Movement, Ë¥æÁéâÈì≠, ÁÑ¶Áª¥Áúü, ÊàöÂ∫ÜÊâç, and Êù®ÁªçÂîê were all required to go to Beijing for re-education. Both Ë¥æ and Êù® were classified as designated rightists, and all classes were suspended, compelling students and faculty to participate in educational activities in Shanghai and engage in labor to combat drought in Jiading County. In 1958, the Religious Affairs Bureau required that Three-Self churches were not to hire students from the Spiritual Academy as ministers, rescinding previously issued appointment letters due to perceived ideological issues, mandating further participation in educational activities. This re-education process continued until March 1959, at which point students from other provinces were sent back to their hometowns. The China Christian Shanghai Spiritual Theological Seminary was ordered closed, marking the end of the last seminary managed through spiritual faction cooperation, ultimately succumbing to the tides of revolution.</p>

<li>National Christian Conference and Promotion Association 14th Annual Meeting 1950 (Song Jun 2017: 117-159, 213-248; Xing Fuzeng 2012b: 25-29, 43-47)</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of January 1950, the Executive Committee of the China National Christian Council decided to hold a national Christian conference in Beijing at Yenching University from August 19 to 27 under the theme ‚ÄúChristianity and the New Era.‚Äù A special preparatory committee was formed to follow up on related work. The committee was chaired by Zhu Youyu (Bishop of the China Anglican Church), with Tu Yuqing (Secretary-General of the National Fellowship), Bao Zheqing (Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Shanghai Baptist Association), Cui Xianxiang (Secretary-General of the National Council of the China Christian Church), and Jiang Changchuan (Bishop of the North China Conference of the China Methodist Church) as vice-chairpersons. Wu Gaozi (Secretary-General of the Promotion Association) was appointed as Secretary-General. Each member was a leader of major denominations and organizations nationwide. The preparatory committee decided to form four groups: the conference declaration, the ministry program, the reform plan, and cooperative organizations. On March 28, the national conference preparatory committee decided to postpone the full meeting. In July, Secretary-General Wu Gaozi proposed his resignation during an executive meeting, which was accepted by the Standing Committee of the Promotion Association. In August, since the national conference was too close to the 14th annual meeting of the Association, to streamline and save resources, it was decided to merge the conference into the annual meeting.</p>
<p>The postponement and eventual cancellation of the national conference reflected the difficulties it faced. On one hand, there were obviously differing opinions within the Chinese church regarding how to reform. The Promotion Association intended to play the role of representing Christianity to push for reform (the Promotion faction), which clearly diverged from the external progressive forces represented by ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù (the Tianfeng faction). On the other hand, more importantly, the Chinese Communist Party was unwilling to see the national conference proceed smoothly. It was clear that the party-state believed the reform work for Christianity should be led by its trusted ally‚ÄîWu Yaozong. If the national conference reached any consensus on church reform, it would undoubtedly become a major obstacle to Wu Yaozong‚Äôs reform efforts. While the Promotion Association was preparing for the national conference, Wu Yaozong, with the support of the party-state, launched a signature campaign for the reform declaration. This grand signature campaign and the Promotion Association seemingly became two different paths for the direction of reform in Chinese Christianity.</p>
<p>The competition for leadership in church reform between Wu Yaozong and the Promotion Association finally concluded with the convening of the 14th annual meeting of the Promotion Association in October 1950. To counter Wu Yaozong‚Äôs reform declaration, Vice Secretary-General Hayward (Victor E. W. Hayward) requested that the annual meeting issue a ‚ÄúLetter to National Believers,‚Äù discussing the Three-Self reform from a religious standpoint. Wu Yaozong was also excluded from the list of the declaration committee. To ensure that the direction of the annual meeting aligned with the vision of the Promotion Association, the Association hoped to retain the attendance rights of missionaries according to the original charter. Additionally, Hayward served as the executive secretary of the procedural committee for the annual meeting and discussed materials on the ‚ÄúChurch Reform Issue‚Äù of the national conference within the procedures to replace Wu Yaozong‚Äôs reform declaration.</p>
<p>On October 9, the East China Military and Political Committee held a symposium, with Christian representatives invited, including: Wu Yaozong, Miao Qiusheng, Jiang Changchuan, Wu Gaozi, Tu Yuqing, Jiang Wenhan, Ai Nian San, Liu Liangmo, Chen Jianzhen, Shao Jingsan, Zheng Jianye, and others. Government representatives included Shu Tong (Minister of the Propaganda Department of the East China Military and Political Committee), Pan Hanyan (Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Minister of the United Front Department of East China Bureau), Zhou Erfu (Secretary-General of the United Front Department of East China Bureau), Mei Dajun (Cadre of the United Front Department), and Zhou Lixing (Director of the East China Religious Affairs Office). The party and government representative lineup was not light, indicating their authoritative presence. The symposium ultimately made two regulations for the annual meeting: first, foreign members of the Promotion Association‚Äôs Executive Committee should not attend the meeting; second, the annual meeting should uphold the objectives of the Christian reform declaration.</p>
<p>Under the active intervention of the CCP, the 14th annual meeting of the Promotion Association, held from October 18 to 25, ultimately passed a resolution supporting the declaration ‚ÄúThe Path for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of the New China‚Äù and called on believers nationwide to actively participate in the signature campaign. Additionally, the annual meeting decided to ‚Äúwith utmost determination, complete the Three-Self Movement within five years.‚Äù Wu Yaozong was also elected as Vice-President of the National Promotion Association amid the opposing forces of support and opposition. After the meeting, major newspapers in Shanghai reported the annual meeting‚Äôs news under titles such as ‚ÄúSevering the Ties Between Christianity and Imperialism.‚Äù(2) Three-Self Reform Declaration Signature Campaign 1950 (Xing Fuzeng 2012b: 25-52; Song Jun 2017: 161-211; Wickeri 1990: 127-133; Bush 1970: 177-187; MacInnis 1972: 158-160)</p>
<p>The brewing of the Three-Self Reform Declaration began with the results of Christian leaders‚Äô discussions with Zhou Enlai during their visit to Beijing. The formation of the Christian delegation was related to the preparations for the national Christian conference. It can be said that both were responses from the Chinese church reflecting on their future and reforms after the establishment of the New China, and they also mirrored the twists and turns of the two factions within the church (the Promotion faction and the Tianfeng faction) moving from unity to division.</p>
<p>In October 1949, the Promotion Association held its first Executive Committee meeting after the establishment of New China. It decided to convene a national representative conference of Christianity as soon as possible, to connect various denominations across the country, and to establish a national administrative body. It also decided to organize a delegation to connect with churches nationwide to facilitate the organization of the national conference. At the meeting, Wu Yaozong hoped to convey the significance and resolutions of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference to various regions. Thus, the Promotion Association, the National Association of Young Men and Women Christians of China, and the Christian representatives of the People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference jointly initiated the organization of the delegation.</p>
<p>In April 1950, the North China delegation was announced, consisting of Wu Yaozong, Liu Liangmo (Director of the Youth Association National Committee), Wu Gaozi, Tu Yuqing, Cui Xianxiang, Wang Zizhong (Secretary-General of the North China Christian United Association), Deng Yuzhi (Secretary-General of the National Women‚Äôs Youth Association), and others. After visiting Jinan from April 15 to 18, the delegation moved to Beijing. On the 30th, Wu, Liu, Deng, Tu, Cui, Wang, along with Zhao Zichan (Yenching School of Religion) and Zhao Fusang (Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Youth Association) held discussions with Deputy Minister Xu Bing of the Central United Front Department on religious issues, during which Wu Yaozong hoped to meet with Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>On May 2, Zhou Enlai met with Wu Yaozong, Liu Liangmo, Deng Yuzhi, Cui Xianxiang, Wang Zizhong, Tu Yuqing, and Jiang Changchuan among others at the State Council. Chen Qiyuan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of the Interior of the Central People‚Äôs Government, was also present. On May 6, Wu Yaozong and others returned to the State Council for a second discussion. Present were additional attendees including Ai Nian San (Shanghai Chinese Lutheran Church), Yang Xiaopeng (Secretary-General of the Tianjin Christian Youth Association), Ling Yuxiu (Chairperson of the Beijing Women‚Äôs Youth Association), Ling Xianyang (Beijing Diocese of the China Anglican Church), Zhao Fusang, and more. Chen Qiyuan and over ten officials from related departments were also in attendance, with discussions lasting more than three hours. At 11 PM on the 13th, Zhou held a third meeting with Wu Yaozong and 19 others, increasing the attendees to include Zhao Zichan, Lu Zhiwei (President of Yenching University), Jiang Changchuan, Gao Fengshan (Principal of Beijing Huiwen Middle School), Pang Huiting (also known as Pang Zhikun, Beijing Congregational Church), Chen Wenrun (Secretary-General of the Beijing Women‚Äôs Youth Association), Liu Weicheng (Shanghai Christian Mutual Association), Huo Peixiu (Tianjin Congregational Church), and Zheng Xisan (Chairman of the Tianjin Wesleyan Church and North China Conference). This discussion lasted four and a half hours and concluded at 3:30 AM the following day.</p>
<p>Christian leaders harbored great expectations for meeting with Zhou Enlai. At that time, the most pressing issues for them were the implementation of policies regarding religious freedom and corresponding measures for managing religion. They hoped the central government would issue directives for local people‚Äôs governments to strictly enforce the provisions on religious freedom outlined in the common program, to help resolve the current issues facing Christianity. However, Zhou pointed out that the main obstacle facing Christianity in China at present was its relationship with imperialism. The government required religious groups to clear and sever ties with imperialism and to establish self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating churches.</p>
<p>At Zhou Enlai‚Äôs request, Wu Yaozong later discussed revising the originally prepared ‚ÄúPreliminary Opinions on Handling Christian Issues,‚Äù which was subsequently renamed ‚ÄúThe Path for Chinese Christianity‚Äôs Future Efforts,‚Äù and submitted this revised version to Zhou Enlai after printing. Notably, Wu Gaozi, the official representative of the North China delegation, was not included on the list of Christian leaders Zhou met with three times. Wu later expressed that this was Zhou‚Äôs deliberate exclusion of him from the list. At that time, Wu held the positions of Secretary-General of the Promotion Association and Secretary-General of the National Conference Preparatory Committee; Zhou‚Äôs disregard for Wu Gaozi clearly indicated the CCP‚Äôs favoritism towards Wu Yaozong and a belittlement of the Promotion Association, aiming to undermine the preparations for the national conference.</p>
<p>On May 15, Wu, Liu, Tu, and Ai left Beijing and continued to visit Xi‚Äôan. On the train, Wu Yaozong revised ‚ÄúThe Path for Chinese Christianity‚Äôs Future Efforts‚Äù and sent the revised draft back to Beijing. On the 20th, the relevant departments of the Central Committee and the State Council held a discussion to review the fifth revised draft of the declaration. While in Xi‚Äôan, Wu Yaozong received Zhou Enlai‚Äôs response to the fifth revision and began to invite dozens of fellow believers within the country to co-sign it.Wu Yaozong, in order to garner more church leaders as co-signers and act as initiator, made concessions on certain opinions. For instance, he accepted the suggestions from Shanghai Christian leaders and modified the statement ‚ÄúChristian organizations should adhere to the principle of not using foreign personnel‚Äù to ‚ÄúChinese Christian churches and organizations that still rely on foreign talent and economic assistance should formulate concrete plans to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency in the shortest possible time.‚Äù Later, he removed the word ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù to avoid misunderstanding that foreign economic relations needed to be severed at once. Furthermore, he deleted the references in the preface of the fifth revision regarding the discussions with Premier Zhou, replacing them with an introduction that emphasized the significance of the declaration itself. Additionally, Beijing church leaders changed the wording in the introduction from ‚Äúthe countries that brought Christianity to China are mainly these imperialist nations‚Äù to ‚Äúthe people who brought Christianity to China are mainly from these imperialist countries.‚Äù Wu had expressed to the Shanghai church leaders that all modifications would need to be approved by Zhou Enlai. However, regarding the fundamental viewpoint on the relationship between Christianity and imperialism, Wu Yaozong remained uncompromising. The basic stance against imperialism provoked significant resentment among church members. On June 6, the Youth Association held a discussion on the declaration, which met with intense opposition from participants. On July 26, over 20 administrative staff from the Promotion Association requested Wu to remove the clauses in the declaration that criticized imperialism.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúReform Declaration‚Äù includes four sections: the preface, general tasks, basic policies, and specific measures. The preface primarily acknowledges that Christianity, over its hundred-plus years of history in China, has ‚Äúestablished relationships with imperialism, both intentionally and unintentionally, in both tangible and intangible ways.‚Äù Even after the establishment of the New China, imperialism still attempted to use Christianity for subversion. The total mission of the Chinese church moving forward is to thoroughly uphold the common program, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism under government leadership, and strive for the construction of the new China. The basic policies include two aspects: first, the Chinese church must acknowledge the fact of being used by imperialism in the past and eliminate the ‚Äúimperialistic influence within Christianity‚Äù; second, it aims to achieve self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation as its reform goals in the short term. As for specific measures, concrete plans must be developed to explore how to achieve self-renewal in a short time and to improve the church in terms of religious and general operations.</p>
<p>On July 28, Wu Yaozong finalized the last (eighth revision) draft titled ‚ÄúThe Path for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of the New China,‚Äù along with the support of 40 Christian initiators, and submitted it for publication, also writing to over a thousand Christian leaders nationwide to solicit their individual signatures in support. Initially, Wu only planned to publish the declaration without intending to turn it into a wide-ranging signature campaign. In June, Zhou Enlai instructed that the declaration be transformed into a signature movement, aiming to leverage mass mobilization to pressure church leadership to accept the reform direction desired by the CCP and to establish Wu‚Äôs leadership position within the Christian reform movement.</p>
<p>The first round of signatures was concluded at the end of August 1950, with a total of 1,527 names received. On September 23, the People‚Äôs Daily published the full text of the declaration on the front page, including the complete list of the first batch of signatures. An editorial titled ‚ÄúThe Patriotic Movement of Christian Leaders‚Äù was also published to generate momentum for the declaration. The editorial affirmed the patriotic movement of Christian leaders and highly praised the signature campaign.</p>
<p>By the end of September 1950, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù announced a second batch of names, increasing the total number of signatories to 3,268, adding 1,741 more than the first batch. Following the People‚Äôs Daily‚Äôs high-profile support for the declaration, various gatherings and symposiums were held nationwide in support of the Three-Self Movement and the Reform Declaration. By early December, the number of signatories had risen to 26,727, and by the end of December, it reached 78,596. By the end of January 1951, nearly 90,000 individuals had signed the Reform Declaration. The involvement and support of political forces played a significant role in the development of the signature campaign for the Reform Declaration. By April 1951, the number of signatures had increased to 200,000. By September 1952, the total number of signatures reached 338,000.</p>

<li>Christian Publishing Review 1951 (Xing Fuzeng 2012b: 229-235)</li>
</ol>
<p>On March 16, 1951, a Christian publishing conference was held in Beijing, aimed at assisting the Christian publishing industry in overcoming difficulties arising from the cessation of American funding after the outbreak of the Korean War, and to discuss how the publishing industry could sever ties with imperialism and eliminate its influences. The timing of the conference coincided with the nationwide anti-American and anti-imperialist movement, making the elimination of imperialist toxins a key focus of the party-state‚Äôs propaganda efforts.</p>
<p>In order to purge the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù elements from Christian publications, the review of Christian books and periodicals was comprehensively initiated after the conference.At that time, the China Christian Publishing Association listed ten standards for the review of publications: (1) authors recognized as traitors to Christianity; (2) direct or indirect, explicitly or implicitly anti-communist, anti-Soviet, or disparaging remarks about the People‚Äôs Government and its leaders; (3) containing imperialist, capitalist, or feudal thoughts; (4) emphasizing unrealistic ‚Äúsuper-political‚Äù ideas that are harmful to patriots; (5) propaganda for imperialism or agents of imperialism; (6) distorting or misunderstanding facts, insulting Chinese culture, and damaging the self-esteem and confidence of the Chinese people; (7) containing inflammatory or divisive ideas that hinder unity between the Chinese people and the government; (8) obstructing the anti-American aid to Korea efforts; (9) indiscriminately endorsing the ‚Äúuniversal church‚Äù manipulated by imperialism; (10) opposing or undermining the Three-Self Movement.</p>
<p>Under these standards, a large-scale political review of Christian publications was initiated. In May 1951, the publishing association required various publishing institutions to notify the association of their review results by the end of July. At the same time, it called on over 200 church organizations in Shanghai to review their collections and report back to the association. In July, the publishing association received review reports from 17 publishing institutions: Guangxuehui, Youth Association Bookstore, Baptist Bookstore, Tianfeng Society, Shizhao Press, China Bible Society, Chinese Sunday School Association, China Anglican Church Publications Committee, Christian Missionary Society, Guangxie Bookstore, Christian Gospel Bookstore, Salvation Bookstore, Gospel Publications, and the Christian Student Union of various universities (14 of these were in Shanghai), along with the China Christian Bible Society (Hankou) and the Literature Department of the Sichuan Conference of the China Christian Church (formerly the British Baptist Bookstore) and the Monthly on Youth Issues (both located in Chengdu). Among the 649 titles submitted for review by Guangxuehui, Youth Association Bookstore, and the Chinese Baptist Bookstore, 352 were deemed problematic, accounting for 54.2% of the total. These works containing ‚Äútoxic‚Äù elements were either removed from sale or edited.</p>
<p>In June 1951, at a mass protest meeting of the Christian community held in Shanghai, Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Christian Three-Self Reform Preparatory Committee, pointed out that American imperialism used Christian publishing as ‚Äúan important tool for cultural invasion.‚Äù In addition to Guangxuehui and other publishing bodies producing numerous reactionary publications that spread toxins, the Bible also became a tool to narcotize the people and implant enslaving thoughts. At the same protest meeting, Hu Zuyin, the volunteer general secretary of Guangxuehui, also made accusations, claiming that ‚Äúthe imperialists‚Äô motive for founding Guangxuehui was not to promote the gospel of Jesus but to narcotize the thoughts of the Chinese people and eliminate their resistance to imperialism.‚Äù He critiqued from the perspective of ‚Äúcultural invasion,‚Äù admitting that among nearly 2,000 books published by Guangxuehui, at least 60% of the materials were translations from American publications, becoming a channel for spreading pro-American, admiration of America, and fear of America ideologies.</p>
<p>In August 1951, the China Christian Publishing Association, Guangxuehui, and the China Bible Society jointly held a conference in Shanghai to expose the crimes of American imperialism exploiting the Christian publishing industry to invade China. At the meeting, Zhang Bohuai, the general secretary of the Publishing Association, pointed out that ‚Äúmany Christian publishing organizations are almost entirely controlled by imperialist agents,‚Äù and their publications disseminate imperialist toxins. ‚ÄúWhether they are conservatives or reformists, spiritualists or social gospel advocates,‚Äù they are all being utilized by imperialists. This protest meeting targeted not only the various toxins found in printed materials but also pointed the finger at the Bible itself, accusing it of being a tool of imperialist cultural invasion. Miao Qiusheng from the China Bible Society indicated that spiritualist missionaries misinterpret the Bible, spreading toxic ideas of super-politics, super-nationalism, super-globalism, and the notion of ‚Äúloving one‚Äôs enemies,‚Äù thus facilitating imperialist invasion. At the meeting, Xie Zonggao and Liu Meili from Guangxuehui also conducted a comprehensive self-critique.</p>
<p>In September 1951, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù published an editorial titled ‚ÄúPurging American Imperialist Influences in the Christian Publishing Industry,‚Äù stating that for many years, American imperialists, under the guise of ‚Äúliterary preaching,‚Äù published a large number of books and periodicals containing various ideological toxins. Both the review of publications and the accusations against publishing institutions were an integral part of the overall CCP‚Äôs efforts regarding Christian reform work. This scrutiny of Christian publications and the campaign of accusations undoubtedly represented a significant event in the history of Christian publishing in China, leading to a heavy blow to the literary publishing industry due to increasing politicization.</p>

<li>First Cadre Training Class for the Christian Three-Self Reform Movement (Xing Fuzeng 1996: 77-80; 2012: 144-145)</li>
</ol>
<p>In November 1951, the Preparatory Committee established the ‚ÄúFirst Cadre Training Class for the Christian Three-Self Reform Movement‚Äù in Shanghai, with the aim of training a group of cadre, especially active young individuals, to serve as the backbone for deeply promoting the Three-Self reforms.Similar training classes were also established in various locations. The Three-Self Reform Training Class lasted for three months, with 99 participants from different denominational churches and organizations in Shanghai. In addition to the members of the Three-Self Reform Preparatory Committee, the East China and Shanghai Religious Affairs Offices also sent nine colleagues, including Section Chief Yao Piaoting and Director Luo Zhufeng, to assist in the training.</p>
<p>The training class preparatory committee was chaired by Tu Yuqing, with Deng Yuzhi as vice-chair and Huang Peiyong as the secretary. Other committee members included Liu Liangmo, Li Chuwen, Situ Tong, Shi Ruzhang, and Shen Derong. The leading roles in the training class were clearly dominated by the Youth Association members, further demonstrating the significant role of the Youth Association faction.</p>
<p>The training program consisted of five main procedures: (1) clarifying learning objectives and establishing a correct learning attitude; (2) recognizing the greatness and love of the motherland: comparing old and new China, understanding the great achievements and future of the New China, and recognizing how the New China came to be; (3) understanding the nature of imperialism and its exploitation of Christianity for invasion: comprehending the essence of imperialism, understanding American imperialism‚Äôs aggression against China (including cultural invasion), and recognizing how imperialism uses Christianity for invasion; (4) understanding the significance of the Three-Self Reform Movement and the government‚Äôs religious policies; (5) learning summary: writing personal learning summaries, group exchanges, and group summaries. From the training class procedures, it was evident that participants were required to learn to support the New China in an anti-imperialist and patriotic manner; as believers or church workers, they were expected to uphold the Three-Self Reform Movement as a foundation.</p>
<p>One participant, Shen Yifan, son of Bishop Shen Zigao of the China Anglican Church, criticized his own thinking in his personal learning summary: ‚ÄúI had long believed that my benefits came from imperialism. In church schools, from elementary to university to seminary, I seemed to sail smoothly; thus, I hoped to study abroad in the UK and the US to obtain a degree and seek a high position within the church after returning. The liberation of China shattered all my personal plans, hence I did not love the New China. At the beginning of the liberation, I held a strong desire for a regime change. When the Korean War broke out, I even felt pleased, believing that the ‚Äòchange of regime‚Äô was imminent. Through a few years of realistic education, especially during this training, I understood the essence of our motherland, recognized the great achievements and bright future of the country; comparing my happy life today with the past, I emotionally affirmed that my fate is inseparable from that of the New China. I must stand from the people‚Äôs perspective to benefit myself.‚Äù</p>
<p>On December 11, the training class held a graduation ceremony attended by over 400 people. In his summary report, Li Chuwen pointed out that after the training, participants recognized the necessity of firmly standing on the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs position‚Äù and clearing the harmful influence of the ‚ÄúChristian position.‚Äù Each participant also recognized the importance of self-criticism and ideological learning, while further solidifying their understanding of the significance of the Three-Self Movement.</p>

<li>Adjustment of Colleges and Nationalization of Church Schools 1952 (Xing Fuzeng 2012b: 189-210)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the early years of the CCP‚Äôs establishment, the approach towards the old education system (particularly private education) was one of ‚Äúprotection and maintenance, strengthening leadership, and gradually transforming.‚Äù In August 1950, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued ‚ÄúGuidelines on Catholic and Protestant Issues,‚Äù reaffirming that church schools were ‚Äúprivate enterprises‚Äù and that the government would treat them equally under the principle of ‚Äúbalancing public and private interests.‚Äù The government set forth requirements: (1) church schools must include political courses as mandatory; (2) church-run higher education institutions could offer religious electives; (3) no exhibitions or mass meetings promoting or opposing religion should be held at schools; (4) student believers and non-believers should not attack each other over faith issues but should unite to oppose imperialist agents.</p>
<p>By the end of 1950, as the anti-American aid to Korea movement deepened, waves of accusations against imperialism for leveraging church schools for cultural invasion swept across the country, leading to vigorous mass movements within church schools. The central government‚Äôs policy on church schools also entered a new stage, with local campaigns against cultural invasion by American imperialism focusing on church schools. By the end of December, both China and the U.S. had frozen each other‚Äôs assets and public and private deposits, prompting the CCP to use the new context of the anti-American aid to Korea movement to accuse American imperialism of cultural invasion in China. Beginning in January 1951, all levels of church schools were fully involved in the wave of the anti-American patriotic movement.</p>
<p>From January 16 to 22, 1951, the Ministry of Education held a conference on ‚ÄúHandling Foreign Subsidized Higher Schools.‚Äù The attendees included leaders from the Education Departments or Cultural and Educational Committees of East China, Central South, and Southwest administrative divisions, as well as 85 representatives, including chairpersons, principals, teachers, and students from 19 higher education institutions receiving foreign subsidies.At the meeting, Minister of Education Ma Xulun pointed out that church schools were significant activities in the cultural invasion of American imperialism. In response to the United States freezing Chinese assets, the State Council decided to reclaim national educational sovereignty, transforming universities that previously received American subsidies into schools managed by the Chinese people themselves. He criticized church schools as an important avenue for America‚Äôs ‚Äúcultural invasion,‚Äù asserting that they disseminated toxic ideas that promoted admiration for America, fear of America, and glorified the decaying ‚ÄúAmerican way of life,‚Äù seeking to undermine Chinese national culture and harm the souls of Chinese youth. Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the State Council‚Äôs Cultural Education Committee, characterized the nature of the issues being addressed as a serious ‚Äúpolitical struggle against American imperialism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following the conference on managing foreign-subsidized higher education institutions, the Military and Political Committees of East China, Central South, and Southwest convened meetings in February 1951 to address issues concerning secondary schools. By the end of 1951, the Ministry of Education completed a summary report on the handling of schools that received American subsidies. The overall evaluation of church schools in the report was that they were ‚Äúa cultural invasion base set up by imperialists under the guise of religion in China.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1952, the Ministry of Education began large-scale adjustments to higher education institutions, resulting in the dissolution of all church universities, which merged with other institutions. From then on, church universities became a historical relic in China. Simultaneously, the Ministry of Education issued directives to take over all private primary and secondary schools nationwide by 1954. The ‚Äúnationalization‚Äù of private schools marked the formal conclusion of the transitional phase of the old educational system in China. However, the national takeover of private schools was in reality a monumental undertaking involving vast resources. As a result, the plan, originally intended to conclude in 1954, was extended until 1956 before it was essentially completed.</p>

<li>Movement to Accuse Christian Historiography (Xu Yihua 2004: 14-18; Xing Fuzeng 1996: 80-81; 2005: 212-219)</li>
</ol>
<p>As early as the end of 1951, the renowned Chinese church historian Wang Zhixin conducted self-criticism regarding his book ‚ÄúOutline of the History of Christianity in China,‚Äù published in 1940. He indicated that his understanding of Anglo-American imperialism was ‚Äúvery vague‚Äù and that there were many imperialist ideological toxins within the text, even falling into reactionary views. Therefore, he ‚Äúrequested all those who possess this book to ruthlessly destroy it, to prevent the continued spread of this ideological toxin.‚Äù</p>
<p>From September to November 1953, Wang Zhixin published his research on ‚ÄúMaterials on the History of Chinese Christianity (Church History)‚Äù in ‚ÄúXie Jin,‚Äù addressing topics such as Christianity and unequal treaties, church incidents, and the Taiping Rebellion. In his writings, he criticized imperialism for using Christianity to invade China, asserting that the activities of missionaries in China ‚Äúare directly proportional to imperialist aggression against large nations.‚Äù Thus, he argued that ‚Äúthe history of Christianity‚Äôs missionary endeavors in China over the past 140 years is essentially the history of imperialist aggression against China.‚Äù</p>
<p>Despite Wang Zhixin‚Äôs attempt to apply the perspective of imperialist aggression to explain Chinese church history, the response was again critical. In February and March 1954, ‚ÄúXie Jin‚Äù published several articles criticizing Wang‚Äôs ‚Äúposition‚Äù in historiography as seriously problematic. Critics believed that while Wang acknowledged in his writings the fact that Western missionaries utilized Christianity to conduct aggression, he ‚Äúdid not articulate it adequately.‚Äù Furthermore, Wang appeared to view the courageous anti-imperialist actions of the Chinese people‚Äîthe church incidents‚Äîas mere ‚Äúchurch difficulties,‚Äù suggesting that they were due to ‚Äúthe ignorance of the common people and exclusivism among local officials.‚Äù This reflected Wang Zhixin‚Äôs insufficient awareness of the iron-clad reality that imperialism used religion as a tool for invasion, as well as his failure to clarify the intertwined nature of Christianity and unequal treaties. In an atmosphere of ‚Äúanti-imperialist‚Äù learning within the church, the publication of these articles inevitably produced negative effects and created considerable confusion among believers.</p>
<p>Due to the discussions concerning the issue of imperialism using Christianity for its aggression, the matter was not merely an academic discussion but rather a statement of political stance from the outset. Consequently, Wang Zhixin quickly responded, acknowledging his insufficient understanding and inappropriate wording. He reiterated, ‚ÄúIf it is said that these two articles of mine intentionally employed oblique language to criticize while covertly supporting, or that I aimed to secretly insert a leg into the conversation, I can firmly deny any such intention or malicious intent. After three years of study, with the help of my peers, I can now admit my understanding of anti-imperialism and patriotism and the Three-Self Reform has continuously improved.‚Äù In addition to Wang Zhixin, Lin Yongyu, the editor of ‚ÄúXie Jin,‚Äù also conducted a review, admitting that when addressing the history of imperialism using Christianity to invade China, if one does not genuinely stand firm on the people‚Äôs position and truly grasp scientific historical perspectives and methods, then even with a ‚Äúmountain of materials,‚Äù one cannot produce a true ‚Äúhistorical narrative.‚ÄùFrom 1953 to 1955, ‚ÄúXie Jin‚Äù published several critical articles concerning the history of Chinese Christianity, primarily assessing the conduct of missionaries (such as the Morrison family, Bishop Burge, Li Lezhi, Li Timoteo, and Pi Zhuwen). Additionally, Tang En compiled a series of historical materials under the theme of ‚Äúlong-term control by American imperialism‚Äù covering institutions like China Christian University, China Christian Theological Seminary, and biblical initiatives.</p>
<p>In 1957, Wang Zhixin, using the pseudonym ‚ÄúEr Wang,‚Äù discussed the early independence movements of Chinese Christianity. He distinguished between the ‚Äúold Three-Self‚Äù and the ‚Äúnew Three-Self,‚Äù evaluating the independence and contextualization movements of the church before and after 1949, along with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which sparked debate on how to assess the independence movement. Critics argued that he acknowledged the ‚Äúold Three-Self‚Äù while forgetting the fundamental people‚Äôs perspective, suggesting that the evaluation should differentiate between ‚Äúfalse Three-Self‚Äù and ‚Äútrue Three-Self,‚Äù as the independence and contextualization movements prior to 1949 were merely tools for imperialism to carry out ‚Äúinsidious and malicious aggression against China.‚Äù In March 1958, the editorial office of ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù officially concluded this debate. They ultimately published a response by Wang Yi to close the discussion and publicly released a document titled ‚ÄúReference Materials on the Issue of Self-Governance,‚Äù which had been compiled by the Secretariat during the 1954 National Christian Conference in China. Although the editors stated they ‚Äúdid not intend to conclude this discussion‚Äù as historical research can continue to be explored and debated, Wang Yi‚Äôs and the document‚Äôs content fully reflected the official stance and tone on the matter.</p>
<p>Wang Yi aimed to differentiate between imperialist missionaries and Chinese believers who led and participated in the independence movement. While he condemned the imperialist crimes of missionaries who invaded China and manipulated the Chinese church, he also recognized that the independence movement reflected the demands of Chinese Christians for autonomy in the early 20th century. He even suggested that the issue of ‚Äúchanging labels‚Äù should not be generalized. He superficially evaded whether the ‚Äúold Three-Self‚Äù necessarily equated to ‚Äúfalse Three-Self,‚Äù only asserting that there were elements of ‚Äúfalse independence‚Äù that had been utilized by missionaries within independent churches. Another distinction Wang sought to make was regarding elements in independent churches that had been labeled as counter-revolutionary. Thus, counter-revolutionaries like Ni Tuosheng and Jing Danying were considered false independent traitors; however, within their churches, there remained a large mass of misled believers who should not be indiscriminately dismissed. Old China, still under the dual pressures of imperialism and feudalism and lacking the leadership and support of the Chinese Communist Party, saw that the achievements of the ‚Äúold Three-Self‚Äù could not be compared with those of the ‚Äúnew Three-Self.‚Äù</p>
<p>The evaluations of historical materials and several issues related to the history of Chinese Christianity in the 1950s can be viewed as the outcome of the official attempts to establish a politically correct historical orthodoxy after 1949, described by Xu Yihua as a ‚Äúhistorical accusation movement.‚Äù The issues involved‚Äîhow to assess missionaries, missionary movements, independence movements, and contextualization movements‚Äîremain contentious topics within the discourse on the history of Chinese Christianity on the mainland.</p>

<li>The Three Major Testimonies and Ten Major Tasks 1956 (Luo Weihong 2014: 712-716)</li>
</ol>
<p>In January 1956, Mao Zedong convened the highest state council meeting, directing the reinforcement and expansion of the people‚Äôs democratic united front, to unite all possible forces. Following Mao‚Äôs suggestion, the Central Committee of the CCP held a special meeting regarding intellectuals, and Zhou Enlai‚Äôs speech during the meeting fully demonstrated the party‚Äôs attitude toward winning over intellectuals. Subsequently, Mao delivered two important speeches in April and May (on ‚ÄúTen Major Relationships‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend‚Äù), reaffirming the CCP‚Äôs concern for economic development and its determination to grant intellectuals greater freedom.</p>
<p>In this relatively relaxed political climate, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee convened its second plenary (expanded) meeting in March 1956, with a total of 249 attendees and representatives, exceeding the number present at the 1954 National Christian Conference. The meeting added 13 new committee members and 4 standing committee members, including newly participating spiritual faction individuals. Several ‚Äúspiritual faction‚Äù members spoke sequentially, including Jia Yuming, Yang Shaotang, Sun Hanshu, Zuo Furu, and Yan Jiale.</p>
<p>Wu Yaozong delivered a report on the ‚ÄúChina Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement,‚Äù proposing the well-known ‚ÄúThree Major Testimonies and Ten Major Tasks.‚Äù The so-called ‚ÄúThree Major Testimonies‚Äù included: the testimony of achieving the Three-Self of the Chinese Church, the testimony of participating in socialism, and the testimony of striving to defend world peace. In explaining the ‚Äútestimony of the Three-Self,‚Äù he stated, ‚ÄúChristianity in China is derived from foreign sources. While spreading the gospel is indeed a good thing, many pious and devoted believers from abroad have offered numerous prayers and contributed significant financial resources to the work of evangelism.‚ÄùHowever, unfortunately, imperialism exploited missionary activities to conduct insidious maneuvers, tightly linking the church system with colonialism‚Ä¶ After years of effort, the Chinese church was able to break free from the ties of the missionary system and colonialism, and Chinese Christians could unite to establish and thrive within their own churches, embarking on the paths of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. He pointed out that the fundamental significance of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement is for Chinese believers to manage their own churches, which ‚Äúdoes not equate to the Chinese church severing its spiritual fellowship with Christians from other countries.‚Äù Opposing colonialism and the invasions of colonial states is not against ‚Äúbelievers and people from other countries.‚Äù Therefore, believers from various national churches are members of one body, with Christ as our common head. The fully autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating Chinese church enables Chinese believers to bear better witness to the gospel of Christ. He reiterated, ‚ÄúWe place great importance on the rich heritage of Christianity over the past two thousand years; this valuable legacy is proof of the work done by the Holy Spirit among believers throughout different eras and regions.‚Äù A fully realized Three-Self Chinese church can also contribute to the spiritual fellowship of Christians worldwide.</p>
<p>What Wu articulated regarding the ‚ÄúThree-Self‚Äù was no longer centered on struggle and accusation but restored more religious meaning. The relationship between Christianity and imperialism did not possess the intrinsic linkage that characterized the accusation movement, but rather returned to a level of being ‚Äúexploited.‚Äù More importantly, in explaining the mission of the ‚ÄúThree-Self‚Äù at that time, there was no previous tendency towards exclusion; he recognized the evangelistic efforts of foreign Christians driven by religious sentiments throughout history and affirmed the spiritual exchanges between the Chinese church and universal Christians, as well as the Chinese church‚Äôs inheritance and development of the two-thousand-year church tradition and heritage, thereby imparting new content to the ‚ÄúThree-Self.‚Äù</p>
<p>The report on the ‚ÄúTen Major Tasks‚Äù also demonstrated the vision and direction for church development. Among the ten tasks, three were of a political and social nature (actively participating in socialist construction, striving for world peace, and promoting patriotic education), while the other seven were church-centered: consolidating and expanding unity, mutual respect, improving church organization, establishing self-support promotion committees, advancing self-propagation studies, promoting publications, meeting the spiritual needs of believers, strengthening theological research, and cultivating talents. Wu‚Äôs propositions regarding ‚Äúbuilding the church‚Äù indeed brought a fresh and relaxed atmosphere to the Chinese church, which had experienced years of political movements and had been raised under the banner of ‚Äústruggle.‚Äù</p>

<li>Overseas Connections of Chinese Christianity 1956-1957 (Matsutani 2016: 175-193; Zhao Tianen, Zhuang Wanfang 1997: 94-95)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the establishment of the CCP, missionaries from Europe and America withdrew from China, marking the end of the missionary era. Simultaneously, under the political climate of anti-imperialist patriotism, the Three-Self Movement not only aimed to sever ties between the Chinese church and imperialism but also fully implemented the accusation movement against Western missionary agencies, labeling them as tools of imperialism in the invasion of China. In this context, the overseas connections of Chinese Christianity were essentially at a standstill. In 1952 and 1955, the British Archbishop of Canterbury, Hewlett Johnson, and a delegation from the British Quakers visited China at the invitation of the Committee for the Defense of World Peace.</p>
<p>As for external visits, they were limited to Eastern European communist countries; for example, in 1952 and 1954, Liu Liangmo and Bishop Zheng Jianye were invited to attend representative conferences by the Christian Democratic Union in East Germany.</p>
<p>Starting in 1956, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee made significant breakthroughs in international connections. In terms of visits, in March 1956, the national Three-Self Movement invited Gustav Nystrom from the Evangelical Alliance of Switzerland, Josef L. Hromadka from Czechoslovakia, Bishop Jano Peter of the Reformed Church of Hungary, and Bishop Rajah Manikam from the India Lutheran Church to visit China. In May 1956, Bishop Hall of the Hong Kong Anglican Church visited China. Between May and October, visits were received from officials of the Japan Christian Women‚Äôs Association, the principal of the St.&nbsp;Guildford Children‚Äôs Home of the Hong Kong Anglican Church, the secretary-general of the United Churches of India, and representatives from the Anglican Church of Australia. From February to September 1958, delegations from the Theological Seminaries of Hamburg University in West Germany, the Japan Christian Visiting Group, and the Hungarian Christian delegation visited China.As for overseas visits, in the summer of 1956, Bishop Ding Guangxun attended the preparatory meeting for the Lambeth Conference of the worldwide Anglican Communion in the UK and later participated as an observer in the meeting of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches (WCC) held in Hungary. During this period, the general secretary of the World Council of Churches suggested that Ding change his status from observer to representative, which Ding did not agree to. The WCC had been accused of being a tool of imperialism during the accusation movement. After the meeting, Ding traveled to West Germany to attend the World Christian Student Federation meeting (with Zhao Fusang and Huang Peiyong also participating). In September, the Chinese Christian delegation went to East Germany to participate in the eighth representative conference of the Christian Democratic Union. In 1957, a representative of the China Christian Church visited India, and later a delegation from the national Three-Self Movement (including Ding Guangxun, Huang Peiyong, Shen Derong, and Chen Jianxun) made a reciprocal visit to Hungary, where the Reformed Church of Hungary conferred an honorary doctorate on Ding Guangxun at the Berenyi Seminary. In November, the Chinese Christian delegation visited Hungary at the invitation of the Hungarian Christian Association.</p>
<p>It is evident that from 1956 to 1957, prior to the Anti-Rightist Campaign, the national Three-Self organization made efforts to restore some connections with the universal church, both in terms of hosting visits and making outbound trips. In alignment with Wu Yaozong‚Äôs ‚ÄúThree Major Testimonies and Ten Major Tasks‚Äù regarding ‚Äúpromoting fellowship and friendship among Christians and peoples of all nations,‚Äù the national Three-Self organization established the China Christian International Liaison Committee in May 1956. The countries and organizations they engaged with were no longer limited to Eastern European countries; they even attempted to connect with overseas denominations (such as the Anglican Church) and the very groups they had accused during the Korean War (the World Council of Churches). This indicates that under the relatively relaxed political atmosphere of 1956-57, Chinese Christianity was exhibiting breakthroughs.</p>
<p>However, following the Anti-Rightist Movement, the political landscape in China tilted left again, and the aforementioned space for engagement dissipated, leading to the inability of the China Christian International Liaison Committee to continue its operations. In 1958, Bishop Ding Guangxun canceled his plans to attend the Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion in London.</p>

<li>Publication of ‚ÄúHoly Light‚Äù 1957 (Wang Weifan 2013: 2)</li>
</ol>
<p>According to a resolution from the second national conference in 1954: ‚ÄúUnder the common goal of opposing imperialism, patriotism, and love for religion, we aim to promote the unity of all believers within the Christian church, further advance the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and adopt the principle of mutual respect regarding differences in faith, systems, and rites among various churches.‚Äù At the end of 1956, Bishop Ding Guangxun suggested that ‚ÄúNanjing Three-Self‚Äù publish a devotional periodical. The publication invited Jia Yuming to name it ‚ÄúHoly Light,‚Äù with plans for it to be a bimonthly. The editorial team included Rev.&nbsp;Li Chenzhong (from the spiritual faction, a graduate of Hunan Bible School and former pastor of the Christian Church in Sucheng, Anhui Province) and Wang Weifan, a graduate of Nanjing Union Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>The purpose of ‚ÄúHoly Light‚Äù was to ‚Äúexpound the truth of the gospel of Christ; nurture the spiritual lives of brothers and sisters in various places; and provide materials for church workers for Bible study, devotions, sermons, and pastoral experiences.‚Äù The inaugural issue was published on March 1, 1957, with contributions from authors including Jia Yuming, Jiang Peifen, Yang Shaotang, Sun Hanshu, Han Peter, Cai Wenhao, and Li Chenzhong, most of whom had backgrounds in the spiritual faction. By 1957, there were about 5,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>However, starting in early summer 1958, the religious community in Jiangsu Province launched a campaign against rightists. The bimonthly ‚ÄúHoly Light‚Äù ceased publication after its seventh issue (February 1958). Nonetheless, the ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Note‚Äù in that issue did not express an intention to cease publication, continuing to call for subscriptions and submissions.</p>

<li>Joint Worship 1958 (Luo Weihong 2014: 729-740)</li>
</ol>
<p>The year 1958 marked a watershed in the development of the Chinese church. As Mao Zedong initiated the Great Leap Forward, signaling a transition towards a communist society, it also marked the advent of an era characterized by ‚Äúadventurism‚Äù and an extreme leftist approach. In an atmosphere of nationwide adventurous sentiment, the communist utopia seemed poised to be realized within Chinese society.</p>
<p>The existence of the Chinese Christian church, especially the multidenominational structure, was viewed as an impediment to the socialist path during the Great Leap Forward and faced severe impacts. In the latter half of 1958, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù began characterizing the organizational structures of Chinese churches and church groups as ‚Äúessentially maintaining a semi-colonial appearance from the era of imperialist domination,‚Äù with ‚Äúthe legacy of imperialism being preserved intact.‚Äù This so-called semi-colonial appearance included: (1) the distorted distribution of churches; (2) sectarian opposition and schisms within the church; (3) the issue of agencies from the era of imperialist missions; (4) the reactionary control of churches.The article further states: ‚ÄúWe must thoroughly change the semi-colonial appearance of Chinese Christianity in the continuing and deepening process of socialist education movements.‚Äù Under this situation, the Three-Self organization implemented joint worship across the country under the guise of changing this ‚Äúsemi-colonial‚Äù appearance.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province was one of the first regions to respond. Between April and May 1958, the Ningbo church proposed four rectification plans, advocating: (1) economic coordination and unified support; (2) unified arrangement of pastoral personnel; (3) unified management of church properties; and (4) the establishment of productive organizations where pastoral personnel could engage in production. The three major church institutions in Hangzhou (the Zhejiang Conference of the China Christian Church, the Zhejiang Diocese of the China Anglican Church, and the Zhejiang-Shanghai Baptist Council) also decided to conduct joint operations in August. In Wenzhou, a citywide expanded meeting of the Three-Self Movement was held from May 26 to 27, 1958, where it was decided to abolish the original denominational names, unify personnel, eliminate denominational distinctions, and unify economic management. In terms of faith traditions, baptism, immersion, anointing, and Sabbath observance were free, but communion was to be held monthly, advocating the use of multiple cups during communion. The meeting also resolved to begin joint worship on the first Sunday of July. During the Great Leap Forward, only six churches remained active in the city, including Chengxi Church (Methodist), Canghe Lane Church (China Christian Self-Governing Church), Huayuan Lane Church (China Inland Mission), Yongguang Church (China Jesus Church), Toushou Naolou Church (Seventh-day Adventist), and Xichengxia Church (Christian Gathering Place). All other churches ceased activities. After July 1958, as church unification progressed, only Chengxi Church served as the venue for Christian activities in the entire city.</p>
<p>The model of joint worship quickly spread from Wenzhou to various parts of the country. Grassroots congregations from different denominations adopted methods of uniting with other congregations in the same region, significantly reducing the number of grassroots congregations. For instance, in Shanghai, the number of churches decreased from 208 in 1950 to only 22 after the implementation of joint worship, and later further reduced to 8. In Beijing, the number shrank from 65 in 1949 to just 4 by 1958. In Jiangsu Province, by the end of 1957, there were 321 Christian churches open in the province, but by early 1959, this number dwindled to 83, with Nanjing‚Äôs larger churches consolidated from 23 to 7. In Sichuan Province, the total number of churches before 1958 was 134, which was reduced to 67 after the implementation of joint worship. In Qingdao, the number was cut down from 50 to 10, and then further down to 7. In Hangzhou, 28 churches were merged into 5, which later reduced to 1 as pastoral staff participated in training, and after the training, a total of 3 churches opened (which was later reduced to 2).</p>
<p>The implementation of joint worship effectively dismantled the denominational system and reinforced the Three-Self organization‚Äôs control over Christianity. Since the founding of the CCP, the national and regional frameworks of various denominations had remained unchanged, and the development of the Three-Self organization was aimed at replacing the leadership of these denominations with reformist figures. However, with the existing denominational structures still in place, the organizational autonomy of the denominations was maintained to a certain degree, and the national Three-Self organization found it difficult to completely interfere with the economic and personnel authority of each national institution. After the implementation of joint worship, denominational organizations ceased to operate, and all levels of the Three-Self organizations became the superior leading bodies of urban and rural churches. This comprehensive leadership of the ‚ÄúThree-Self‚Äù over the ‚Äúchurch‚Äù fundamentally transformed the denominational system of Chinese Christianity and reflected the party-state‚Äôs proactive use of the political situation to implement a more radical religious policy. This was also an inevitable outcome of the highly centralized and unitary leadership system of the state.</p>
<p>During the Great Leap Forward, Wenzhou became a pilot ‚Äúno-religion zone,‚Äù and policies aimed at eliminating religion were officially put on the agenda. The joint worship promoted across the country significantly reduced the number of grassroots churches, with many pastors being reassigned to work in factories. All of these actions undoubtedly formed part of the ‚Äúelimination of religion‚Äù policy.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Political Movements and Christianity in the 1950s (Ying 2014)</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, the CCP has successfully consolidated its one-party dictatorship through a series of political and mass movements (suppressing counter-revolutionaries, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, ideological remolding, the Three Anti and Five Anti movements, purging counter-revolutionaries, and the Anti-Rightist Campaign). Simultaneously, economic transformations (such as land reform and collectivization) realized the state‚Äôs control over land and other agricultural resources. The state gained control and allocation rights over the vast majority of resources within society. For a social member to obtain the most basic conditions for survival, it was necessary to acquire the corresponding resources from the state, thus forming a highly unified total society. Under this model of integration, the party-state penetrated deeply and widely into grassroots social life at an unprecedented level and scope, causing local social integration to be subordinate to the political integration at the state level, achieving a high degree of consistency between the two.The effectiveness of this integration model, however, came at the cost of destroying social independence and autonomy. In other words, the ‚Äútotalism‚Äù that Zou Dong referred to, where the power of political institutions can intrude into and control various levels and sectors of society without limits, reached its peak during the Cultural Revolution but developed through successive political movements starting from the early years after the founding of the country in the 1950s.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, as China moved towards totalitarian politics, every political movement, regardless of its purpose or the target of its actions, inevitably affected the Chinese church because Christianity was viewed as a heterogeneous force associated with imperialist aggression. For example, during the early political movements of the CCP‚Äôs regime, land reform not only mobilized urban churches to participate in rural land reforms, expressing their support through direct involvement but also led to rural churches being occupied and church properties being confiscated under the accusation of being ‚Äúlandlords.‚Äù The anti-American aid to Korea movement targeted the fight against ‚ÄúAmerican imperialism‚Äù and made Christian churches and their associated endeavors a focal point for liquidating and denouncing American ‚Äúcultural invasion.‚Äù Although the ideological reform was primarily aimed at intellectuals transitioning from the old society, Christian individuals were also required to learn to transform their thoughts through criticism and self-criticism, thus purging the ‚Äúreligious toxins‚Äù of imperialism. The Three Anti Campaign focused on ‚Äúanti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy,‚Äù targeting cadres in government agencies, while the Five Anti Campaign referred to ‚Äúanti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-quality deterioration, and anti-stealing national economic secrets,‚Äù primarily aimed at capitalists. However, large figures in Christian endeavors were also accused of violating the ‚ÄúFive Anti‚Äù campaign. Moreover, the Three Anti and Five Anti campaigns became intertwined with ideological reform, evolving into various forms of ‚Äúideological big tigers.‚Äù These movements were interconnected and conducted through intense mass mobilization methods (such as accusation meetings), aiming to expose and denounce class enemies (American imperialist lackeys, bad elements, and big tigers).</p>
<p>The mobilization methods mentioned continued to be applied in political movements after the mid-1950s, including the purge of counter-revolutionaries in 1955 and the Anti-Rightist Campaign (or Socialist Education) in 1957-58. Within these nationwide political movements, Christianity was inevitably required to purge counter-revolutionaries and rightists hiding within the church.</p>
<p>During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Christianity had to fully cooperate with the transition to a communist society and undergo comprehensive changes. During this period, churches across various regions actively engaged with the party, and pastors were characterized as members of the exploiting class; even religious thoughts were temporarily classified as ‚Äútoxins.‚Äù In this context, joint worship further dismantled the denominational system of churches and, under the guise of merging, closed numerous churches nationwide.</p>

<li>Cleansing the Poison of Imperialism (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û2012b: 127-130, 136-140; Ying 2022; Wickeri 1990: 133-146)</li>
</ol>
<p>In January 1951, Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó wrote in „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã that the issue of ‚Äúself-propagation‚Äù is not about ‚Äúwho propagates,‚Äù but rather about ‚Äúwhat is being propagated.‚Äù If having Chinese people propagate the Gospel signifies the completion of ‚Äúself-propagation,‚Äù then the problem is clearly solved. Most Western missionaries have already retreated, and the task of spreading the Gospel has naturally been passed on to Chinese believers. However, Âê≥ firmly believed that the issue of self-propagation is not that simple. His concern was: What should Chinese believers ‚Äúpropagate‚Äù? If what is being propagated by Chinese individuals is still the same set of beliefs originating from the West, then the Chinese church remains deeply influenced by the poison of Western imperialism. Therefore, he said: ‚ÄúIf we truly want to achieve ‚Äòself-propagation,‚Äô Chinese believers must discover the treasures of Jesus‚Äôs Gospel for themselves, break free from the shackles of Western theology, reassess escapist thinking, and create a theological system of their own; only then can we express the true spirit of Jesus‚Äôs Gospel within the context of the new China.‚Äù</p>
<p>Âê≥‚Äôs interpretation of self-propagation indicates that the precondition for reasserting the ‚Äútrue spirit‚Äù of the Christian Gospel in the new China is to cleanse the influence of imperialist poison on Christianity. The ‚Äúpoison‚Äù mainly involves two aspects: (1) Reformism; (2) Supersessionism.</p>
<p>Regarding reformism, it mainly targets the social gospel movement related to the reform of Chinese society. The Christian Youth Association can be said to represent this aspect. On July 27, 1951, the National Council of the China Christian Youth Association and the National Council of the Young Women‚Äôs Christian Association held an accusation conference, where Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó accused American imperialism of using ‚Äúreformism‚Äù to invade China through the youth association. What is reformism? Âê≥ stated, ‚ÄúAny approach that prettifies the surface, evades class struggle, and opposes the use of revolutionary means to overthrow the old social system is reformism.‚Äù He pointed out that the greatest task of the Chinese revolution is to overthrow the three major enemies: imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. However, the youth association not only did not oppose these three enemies but also attempted to ‚Äúdeceive the masses‚Äù through public education, rural services, and labor welfare, thus ‚Äúblur the Chinese people‚Äôs perception of the dominance of these three major enemies.‚Äù The young women‚Äôs association representative ÈÑßË£ïÂøó also indicated during the accusations that the youth association advocated a ‚Äúthird way,‚Äù attempting to propose ‚ÄúChristian social democracy‚Äù outside of capitalism and communism. This assertion aims to ‚Äúdivide the revolutionary forces of the colonized people‚Äù and foster accomplices for imperialism.</p>
<p>Another figure, ÂäâËâØÊ®°, who became a backbone of the national Three-Self Movement, stated in a January 1952 seminar on the Christian ideological transformation that reformism seeks to ‚Äútransform society through gradual legal means, without revolution,‚Äù which is essentially ‚Äúreactionary.‚Äù Because it ‚Äúdissipates revolutionaryÂäõÈáè, numbs the people‚Äôs resistance to reactionary rule, and prolongs the lifespan of reactionary domination.‚Äù</p>
<p>If the target of the critique against this ‚Äútoxin‚Äù of reformism is the ‚Äúsocial gospelists‚Äù of Chinese Christianity, then for the ‚Äúspiritualists,‚Äù the toxin they spread is ‚Äúsupersessionism.‚Äù According to Christian Political Consultative Conference representative ÂäâËâØÊ®° in March 1951, ‚Äúsupersessionism‚Äù is the attitude that ‚ÄúChristians should not concern themselves with politics.‚Äù He believed, ‚ÄúThis is an excuse used by a minority of bad elements within Christianity to deceive believers and to incite discord between the believers and our people‚Äôs government.‚Äù The term ‚Äúsupersessionism‚Äù itself represents ‚Äúa form of political attitude.‚Äù Later, Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó also pointed out, ‚ÄúAmerican imperialism has exploited the ‚Äòspiritualists‚Äô within Christianity, donning a fa√ßade of extreme mysticism, distorting the Bible, spreading poisonous thoughts of ‚Äòsupersessionism,‚Äô anti-communism, anti-Soviet, and anti-people, attempting to incite conflict between countless devout Christians and our people‚Äôs government.‚Äù</p>
<p>As a member of the spiritualist faction, ÈÉëËØÅÂÖâ, an elder from the Á¶èÂ∑û meeting place, acknowledged that the spiritualist faction appears ‚Äútranscendent,‚Äù ‚Äúdeceiving socially passive Christians with the lie that Christians are heavenly and should not ‚Äòconcern‚Äô themselves with earthly matters, propagating the toxic idea that Christians should be ‚Äòsupersessionist‚Äô!‚Äù As a result, Christians are unwilling to resist the oppressive ruling class and the aggression of imperialism. After the establishment of the new China, ‚Äúsupersessionism‚Äù also diluted the will of the people‚Äôs revolution and weakened the strength of the people‚Äôs revolution.</p>
<p>By the end of 1952, the Jinling Union Theological Seminary, formed by the merger of 11 theological colleges and Bible schools in East China, was officially established, and published the „ÄäÈáëÈôµÂçèÂíåÁ•ûÂ≠¶Âøó„Äã in September 1963, undertaking the task of constructing a new era of Christian theology.ÂâØÈô¢ÈïøË™†Ë≥™ÊÄ°Âú®„ÄäÂèëÂàäËØç„Äã‰∏≠ËØ¥Ôºö‚ÄúËøáÂéªÂü∫Áù£ÊïôË¢´‰∫∫Âà©Áî®‰Ωú‰∏∫‰æµÁï•‰∏≠ÂõΩÁöÑÂ∑•ÂÖ∑Ôºå‰ª•Ëá¥ËçíË∞¨ÁöÑ„ÄÅÂèõÈÅìÁ¶ªÁªèÁöÑÊÄùÊÉ≥Á´ü‰Ωú‰∏∫‚ÄòÁ•ûÂ≠¶‚Äô‰º†Êí≠ÔºåÁ∫ØÊ≠£ÁöÑ‰ø°‰ª∞Ë¢´Êâ≠Êõ≤‰∫Ü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂêéÊàë‰ª¨‰∏ç‰ΩÜË¶ÅËÇÉÊ∏ÖÊØíÁ¥†ÔºåËÄå‰∏îËøòË¶ÅÁßØÊûÅÂú∞ÂºòÊâ¨ËÄ∂Á®£Âü∫Áù£ÊãØÊïëÁöÑÁúüÁêÜÔºå‰∏éÁà±ÂõΩÁà±ÊïôÁöÑÂπøÂ§ß‰ø°Âæí‰ª¨ËÅîÂêàËµ∑Êù•ÔºåÊé®Ëøõ‰∏âËá™Èù©Êñ∞ËøêÂä®„ÄÇ‚Äù</p>

<li>Christianity‚Äôs ‚ÄúD√©b√¢cle‚Äù in China? 1951 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û2012b: 285-286, 303-306; Hood 1991: 185-222)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1951, the renowned missionary journal „ÄäÂõΩÈôÖÂÆ£ÊïôËØÑËÆ∫„Äã(International Review of Missions) published an article authored by ‚Äú‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰º†ÊïôÂ£´‚Äù (A China Missionary), which sparked significant controversy and reaction within the Western missionary camp. The article was titled „ÄäÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂú®Âçé‰º†ÊïôÊΩ∞Ë¥•ËäªËÆÆ„Äã (First Thoughts on the D√©b√¢cle of Christian Missions in China), summarizing the author‚Äôs reflections on the failures of Western missionary efforts in China after his withdrawal from the mission field. At the time, many missionaries were fleeing China, marking the official ‚Äúloss‚Äù of the largest missionary field in the world and drawing a conclusion to over a century of Western missionary work in China. ‚Äú‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰º†ÊïôÂ£´‚Äù believed that the mission agencies and missionaries held some responsibility for the end of the missionary movement in China, and its ‚Äúd√©faite‚Äù (D√©b√¢cle) was not without the ‚Äújudgment‚Äù (judgment) of God.</p>
<p>The true identity of ‚Äú‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰º†ÊïôÂ£´‚Äù is David M. Paton, an English Anglican who had served in Chongqing and Fujian, and returned to his home country in January 1951. Shortly after his return, he participated in a Far Eastern consultation convened by the International Missionary Council, where he presented seven lessons learned. The article „ÄäÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂú®Âçé‰º†ÊïôÊΩ∞Ë¥•ËäªËÆÆ„Äã is based on this foundation. In 1953, he published the book „ÄäÂü∫Áù£Êïô‰º†ÊïôËøêÂä®Âíå‰∏äÂ∏ùÁöÑÂÆ°Âà§„Äã(Christian Missions and the Judgment of God) in London, further elaborating his views.</p>
<p>He noted that the end of the missionary era can be understood in terms of God‚Äôs will, the work of Satan, political factors, tragedy, or a combination of these various interpretations.

<li>Zhou Enlai (Xing Fuzeng 2023: 106, 112; 2012: 24, 29-34, 39-40; MacInnis 1972: 24)</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhou Enlai (1883-1976), originally from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, was born in Huai‚Äôan, Jiangsu. He studied at Nankai Middle School in Tianjin in 1913 and later attended Nankai University. He had short-term studies in Japan, France, and England, and joined a communist group during his time in France. During the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he served as the secretary of the Central Bureau of the Communist Party‚Äôs Soviet Area. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he was the director of the Eighth Route Army‚Äôs office in Chongqing. After the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, he served as the Premier of the State Council (also Secretary of the Party Group), Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference, and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He passed away in January 1976.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai was a key pioneer in religious work in the early years of the Communist Party‚Äôs founding. In June 1950, at the second Party Group meeting of the National Committee, he categorized religions in China into ‚Äúethnic religions‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitically connected‚Äù religions, with the former being Islam and Lamaism, and the latter referring to Christianity and Catholicism, which he stated were ‚Äúconnected to imperialism.‚Äù He emphasized that one must not underestimate the use of Catholicism and Christianity as tools of aggression by imperialists. Chinese religious practitioners and activities must ‚Äúsever ties with imperialism to block the plots of imperialists.‚Äù However, this struggle was primarily aimed at activities involving reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements, while the vast majority of believers remained a target for unity. When dealing with reactionary elements in the religious community, it was necessary to not ‚Äúinvolve general religious issues,‚Äù and he reiterated the importance of ‚Äúrespecting everyone‚Äôs freedom of belief,‚Äù stating that the government should protect churches and temples from occupation and destruction.</p>
<p>In March 1950, the First National United Front Work Conference was held in Beijing, establishing the basic principles for work on Catholicism and Christianity after the founding of the nation. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the central policy was ‚Äúto sever ties with imperialism,‚Äù and ‚ÄúChinese religions should be handled by Chinese people.‚Äù While opposing imperialism, care should be taken to avoid ‚Äúentangling religious belief issues.‚Äù</p>
<p>In May 1950, Zhou Enlai met with Christian figures three times. During the second conversation on May 6, he addressed the concerns raised by church leaders, particularly regarding government policies on foreign missionaries and overseas donations, pointing out that ‚Äúforeign missionaries can easily become unwitting tools of imperialism,‚Äù hence church organizations should not hire more. However, the government did not require missionaries currently in China to leave immediately. On the issue of overseas donations, he stated that in principle, ‚Äúfundraising from abroad should not be continued,‚Äù but also advised not to ‚Äúblindly exclude‚Äù donations as long as there were no strings attached. He simultaneously pointed out that the main obstacle faced by Christianity in China was its ties to imperialism. He made it clear that the reason for Chinese people‚Äôs opposition to Christianity is inseparable from Christianity‚Äôs ties to imperialist aggression over the past hundred years. He reiterated that ‚Äútoday, American imperialism still attempts to use China‚Äôs religious organizations to undermine the People‚Äôs Republic of China.‚Äù Therefore, the government required religious organizations to clear up and sever ties with imperialism, establishing self-governing, self-sustaining, and self-spreading churches.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai was fully aware that most church leaders found it difficult to accept the accusation of Christianity‚Äôs ties to imperialism. Therefore, in a third conversation lasting over four hours on May 13, he frankly stated that whether the government accepted Christianity depended on whether both sides could cooperate politically. He clearly proposed that theists and atheists, idealists and materialists could politically cooperate: ‚ÄúClearing imperialist influences from the religious sector does not mean that everyone in the religious sector has been used as tools of imperialism. Individually, one might feel they have not been used, but imperialism subjectively has its demands; they use religious organizations, which is a fact. The vast majority of believers may also be inadvertently used. We must clarify this point. Once this issue is clarified, it will only benefit the church.‚Äù Zhou Enlai reaffirmed that the government did not aim to eliminate religion but to ‚Äúremove the bad apples, a small number of lackeys, and Judases from the religious sector.‚Äù He did not hide the government‚Äôs bottom line: ‚ÄúWe need to expand our united front, and its boundaries depend on whether ties with imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism are severed.‚Äù ‚ÄúOnce you establish your political stance, you will not be discriminated against; only this way can there be a way out.‚Äù Zhou Enlai‚Äôs remarks led to the emergence of Wu Yaozong‚Äôs Three Self-Reform Declaration and the subsequent signature campaign.</p>
<p>In June 1950, at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party, Zhou Enlai reiterated the need to help religious figures ‚Äúsever ties with imperialism‚Äù and support them to ‚Äúmanage their own religions, perform and sing on their own, without foreign missionaries.‚ÄùIn July, Zhou Enlai instructed the Cultural and Educational Committee under the State Council to establish a ‚ÄúResearch Group on Religious Issues,‚Äù led by Lu Dingyi, the deputy director of the committee, with Shao Quanlin, the deputy secretary-general, serving as the group leader. The main task of the group was to provide recommendations to the State Council regarding the situations involving Catholicism, Christianity, and Buddhism.</p>
<p>On December 29, the State Council approved several documents during its 65th executive meeting, including the ‚ÄúDecision of the Central People‚Äôs Government State Council on Handling Cultural and Educational Relief Agencies and Religious Groups Receiving American Subsidies‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRegulations on the Registration of Cultural and Educational Relief Agencies and Religious Groups Receiving Foreign Subsidies and Investment.‚Äù Zhou Enlai pointed out in the executive meeting, ‚ÄúIn the past, we envisioned that it would take another three to four years to completely eliminate the remnants of American imperialism from China. However, the recent announcement by the United States to freeze our assets in their territory has given us a very favorable opportunity to accelerate the clearance of American imperialism‚Äôs residual influence in our country. Now, we are announcing this order, which is a severe blow to American imperialism.‚Äù</p>

<li>Lu Dingyi (Xing Fuzeng 2023: 112-116; 2012: 79-85)</li>
</ol>
<p>Lu Dingyi (1906-1996) was from Wuxi, Jiangsu. In 1922, he enrolled in Shanghai Nanyang University and joined the Communist Party in 1925. After graduation, he devoted himself to revolutionary work, mainly engaging in the Communist Youth League and propaganda efforts. In 1937, he served as the head of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Eighth Route Army, and in 1945, he became the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee. After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, he served as the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee (1949-1952; 1954-1965), Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People‚Äôs Government (1953-1954), and Secretary of the Party Group of the State Council‚Äôs Cultural and Educational Committee (1949-1952). During the Cultural Revolution, he was criticized and even imprisoned. He was rehabilitated in 1979 and served as an advisor to the Central Committee‚Äôs Propaganda Department in 1980. He passed away in May 1996.</p>
<p>The religious control system in the early years of the Communist Party‚Äôs founding centered on the Religious Affairs Committee established in January 1951 (later renamed the Religious Work Committee) within the Party, mainly led by the Propaganda Department and assisted by the United Front Work Department. On the government side, in July 1950, the Cultural and Educational Committee under the State Council established a ‚ÄúResearch Group on Religious Issues,‚Äù led by Lu Dingyi, mainly responsible for work concerning Catholicism, Christianity, and Buddhism (Islam and Tibetan Buddhism fell under the jurisdiction of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission). Lu Dingyi, as the Minister of the Propaganda Department and Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee (also Secretary of the Party Group), was the primary leader overseeing Christian and Catholic affairs in the Central Committee until 1954.</p>
<p>From January 16 to 25, 1951, the Second National United Front Work Conference was held in Beijing, focusing on united front work in the context of the Korean War. Lu Dingyi spoke about work concerning Christianity and Catholicism, stating that it was essential to decisively eliminate the cultural invasion of American imperialism in China, describing this as part of the ‚Äústruggle against imperialism.‚Äù To achieve victory in the anti-imperialist struggle, he suggested that ‚Äúin addition to launching a general mass anti-imperialist movement, we must also win over Catholics and Christians.‚Äù He candidly pointed out that these believers had long been influenced by American imperialists, and mobilizing them would be a difficult task. He specifically reminded cadres to approach the issue from a ‚Äúpatriotic perspective,‚Äù advising against starting with claims of the church being used by imperialism, which would make believers ‚Äúfeel uncomfortable and hard to accept.‚Äù Instead, he proposed to first clarify the principles of patriotism before pointing out that there were ‚Äúbad elements‚Äù within the church, which would make it easier for them to accept. Lu emphasized that the church in China ‚Äúwill not be quickly eliminated‚Äù and that even ‚Äúweakening‚Äù it would face significant challenges, asserting that ‚Äúone cannot implement dictatorship over religion.‚Äù Therefore, the current focus of religious work should be to make the church ‚Äúpolitically and organizationally sever ties with imperialism.‚Äù He stressed that there is a conflict between idealism (religion) and materialism, and that the emphasis now is on requiring religions to cut ties with imperialism, with the government needing to support the reform movement within Christianity to attract believers away from the influence of imperialism and achieve the goal of transforming the church.</p>
<p>From April 16 to 21, 1951, the State Council‚Äôs Cultural and Educational Committee held a ‚ÄúMeeting on Handling Christian Organizations Receiving American Subsidies.‚Äù Lu Dingyi stated at the meeting that it was ‚Äúa struggle‚Äù aimed at eliminating the cultural invasion influences of American imperialism in China. Chinese Christians must stand with the government on the common political foundation of patriotism. He repeatedly emphasized how American imperialism historically and currently used Christianity to conduct cultural invasion, and he specifically criticized the ‚Äúapolitical‚Äù stance of Christians, pointing out that Christians must assist the government in exposing counter-revolutionaries within the church.He hoped that Chinese believers would actively participate in the three major movements and eradicate thoughts of fear, admiration, and flattery towards the United States, establishing feelings of hatred, disdain, and contempt towards American imperialism. At the meeting, Lu Dingyi explicitly called for Christianity to launch a denunciation campaign.</p>
<p>From November 27 to December 16, 1953, the Second National Religious Work Conference was held. The meeting was presided over by Lu Dingyi, the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council. The conference summarized the work related to Christianity in the country from 1950 to 1953 and formulated work guidelines and tasks for the future.</p>

<li>Zhang Zhiqi (Shanghai Local Chronicles; Zhang Zhiqi 1957: 52-77; 1958a; 1958b; 1958c: 2102-2103; MacInnis 1972: 23)</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhang Zhiqi (1911-1983) was from Hanyang, Hubei. He joined the Communist Party Youth League in 1927 and became a member of the Communist Party in 1929. After 1935, he worked in Shanghai and participated in various patriotic organizations. In 1946, he organized and led crowds in Shanghai for an anti-civil war peace march. In 1947, following the establishment of the Central Committee‚Äôs Shanghai Bureau, he served successively as the Secretary of the Cultural and Industrial United Front Committee of the Shanghai Bureau, Secretary of the County Workers‚Äô Committee, and Secretary of the Incitement Workers‚Äô Committee. After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, he held various positions including member of the Standing Committee of the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee, Secretary-General of the Central South Military and Political Committee, and Deputy Director of the Central National Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>From August 1954 to January 1965, Zhang Zhiqi served as the Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee. After the anti-rightist campaign, Zhang aligned his understanding of united front work with the Party‚Äôs line. In his 1957 article ‚ÄúClass Contradictions and Internal Contradictions Among the People,‚Äù he stated that while China was mainly still in a situation of ‚Äúinternal contradictions among the people,‚Äù ‚Äúclass contradictions had not yet been completely resolved, and class struggle had not ended.‚Äù There remained ‚Äúa considerable number of people‚Äù opposing the Communist Party of China and even attacking it. In the ideological realm, the ‚Äúcontradiction between proletariat and non-proletariat thoughts‚Äù was still ‚Äúa relatively prominent contradiction.‚Äù If not handled properly, it could further escalate into confrontational struggles. Therefore, it was necessary to encourage moderates to ‚Äúlean left‚Äù or even ‚Äúmake a remarkable leftward shift.‚Äù</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, in 1958, he attempted to lead the united front with class struggle in his essay ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs Democratic United Front is a Special Form of Class Struggle,‚Äù stating that ‚Äúsocialist revolution must use struggle to eliminate the bourgeoisie,‚Äù and that the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Democratic United Front‚Äù was ‚Äúa special method for engaging in class struggle‚Äù and ‚Äúa special weapon for advancing the socialist revolution and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.‚Äù The united front was a combination of unity and struggle, aimed at ‚Äúconstantly achieving transformation.‚Äù Essentially, it emphasized ‚Äúpeaceful transformation,‚Äù specifically through a ‚Äúredemption policy‚Äù (that is, allocating benefits economically and politically) and educational methods to encourage self-transformation, characterized by ‚Äúboth tension and relaxation,‚Äù which required ‚Äúa long-term struggle process.‚Äù He was confident that a ‚Äúnew favorable situation‚Äù had been created, ‚Äúaccelerating the pace of socialist transformation‚Äù to achieve ‚Äúa socialist society without class exploitation.‚Äù</p>
<p>If class struggle had not yet concluded, the united front became a ‚Äúspecial form‚Äù of class struggle. How would the Communist Party deal with religious issues? In 1958, he published an article titled ‚ÄúAtheists and Theists Can Cooperate Politically and Walk the Socialist Path‚Äù in ‚ÄúPhilosophical Research.‚Äù On the surface, it seemed that atheists could collaborate politically with theists, but in reality, the article expressed how he understood the relationship between religion and ‚Äúclass contradictions.‚Äù It is evident that after the anti-rightist struggle, the Communist Party was grappling with the complexity of religious issues in the context of the struggle between ‚Äútwo roads‚Äù: socialism and capitalism. (1) Under the internal contradictions among the people, it did not mean that ‚Äúthe religious issue had no class contradictions among the people currently; or that antagonistic contradictions no longer existed.‚Äù In navigating the ‚Äúsocialist revolution,‚Äù specifically during the struggle between the two roads, the situation of the religious community remained very complex; (2) this was reflected in believers‚Äô insufficient political awareness of socialism. Meanwhile, the upper-level figures ‚Äúwho genuinely uphold anti-imperialism, love for the country, support for the socialist path, and the leadership of the Communist Party were still a minority.‚Äù There were many in the religious community who, although they ‚Äúmight accept the leadership of the Communist Party and walk the socialist path,‚Äù were still in a neutral political position, ‚Äúharboring varying degrees of skepticism toward the Communist Party and socialism or having conflicting sentiments.‚ÄùHowever, the serious issue is that within the religious community, there are still individuals who not only ‚Äúhave not clearly drawn the line between themselves and imperialism and counter-revolutionaries, but some have even openly expressed a firm unwillingness to sever ties with imperialism (especially the Vatican), opposing the socialist new China and the leadership of the Communist Party.‚Äù In this regard, the contradictions manifested are ‚Äúantagonistic contradictions, that is, enemy-versus-us contradictions.‚Äù These ‚Äúbourgeois reactionary rightists in the religious community‚Äù often disguise themselves in religious garb and are utilized by ‚Äúimperialists, remnant counter-revolutionaries, landlord class members, and rich peasant elements‚Äù to struggle against the Chinese people through the issue of religion. Furthermore, Catholicism and Christianity have originally been tools of imperialist invasion, and imperialism is still unwilling to accept its defeat in China. The threat of imperialism to China still exists, so their struggle against the Chinese people is long-term. ‚ÄúWe must continue to work hard to completely rid religion of the influence and control of imperialist forces and hostile classes, transforming the religious issue entirely into internal contradictions among the people.‚Äù</p>
<p>At that time, the socialist education movement in the religious community (i.e., the anti-rightist struggle) was in full swing. Zhang Zhiqi raised the issue of ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù and ‚Äúestablishing,‚Äù indicating that this movement, while ‚Äúaimed at breaking the political stance of capitalism among religious individuals and establishing a political stance of socialism,‚Äù did not ‚Äúrequire religious believers to abandon their faith.‚Äù He acknowledged that Marxist-Leninists could ‚Äúfirmly stand on a socialist political stance‚Äù without needing ‚Äúevery supporter of the socialist political system to be a Marxist-Leninist,‚Äù and that they could be allowed to retain different worldviews in terms of ideology and to keep their respective religious beliefs. In this publicly published article, he addressed criticisms that the Communist Party‚Äôs ‚Äúreligious policy is a deception‚Äù and that ‚ÄúCommunists want to eradicate religion.‚Äù Thus, despite the strong flavor of ‚Äúclass struggle‚Äù expressed in the text, he still affirmed the importance of the policy of religious freedom.</p>
<p>However, Zhang‚Äôs remarks at internal meetings conveyed a different message. In May 1958, the Communist Party held a professional meeting on religious work, where Zhang Zhiqi delivered a speech that communicated the central government‚Äôs basic stance on religious work to the religious cadres. He pointed out that religion, as ‚Äúa superstructure leftover from the old society,‚Äù although it had lost its foundation after the elimination of the exploiting classes, would not be ‚Äúimmediately eliminated‚Äù and could still ‚Äúprolong its ideology for a considerable period.‚Äù However, ‚Äúgenerally speaking, religion is unlikely to develop and will gradually weaken, and we should consciously facilitate its gradual weakening.‚Äù The so-called ‚Äúconsciously facilitate‚Äù means to implement reforms of the religious system.</p>
<p>Then, would it contradict the policy of religious freedom for the government to lead the reform of religion? In the current political situation, how should the policy of religious freedom be understood? Zhang Zhiqi emphasized that religious freedom, in addition to promoting freedom of religion, also includes ‚Äúthe freedom to promote non-belief‚Äù and ‚Äúthe freedom to promote anti-religion.‚Äù His understanding of ‚Äúprotecting religious freedom‚Äù is that it does ‚Äúnot help religion develop, but is aimed at politically uniting the masses of believers to work with the working people to develop productivity and advance politically.‚Äù Zhang candidly pointed out that to achieve the ‚Äúelimination‚Äù of religion, one must first promote its ‚Äúweakening.‚Äù ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs protection is for tomorrow‚Äôs elimination. Protecting religious freedom is to create conditions that prompt differentiation within the religious community, allowing them to use their own hands to transform themselves in a manner of self-reformation, ultimately achieving the elimination of religion.‚Äù</p>

<li>Chinese Communist Party (Ying 2014: 884-901; MacInnis 1972; Yang 2012: 65-72)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party is a revolutionary party with a strong ideological orientation. Both before and after the establishment of the nation, it insisted on transforming Chinese society according to revolutionary ideals and goals (communism), while also making adjustments to meet the needs of realpolitik. As a party that believes in materialism and atheism, how to handle religious issues has been an unavoidable topic in its revolutionary nation-building process. From a worldview perspective, the CCP adheres to the opposition between materialism and idealism, viewing religion as the ‚Äúopiate of the people‚Äù and its ultimate demise, but it also establishes unity and struggle against religion based on real political needs, as well as the means to achieve the end of religion. Thus, religious work has always been an important aspect of the CCP‚Äôs united front work, with judgments regarding unity and struggle made according to the political line and needs of different eras.</p>
<p>Reviewing the history of the CCP since its founding in 1921, religious struggle has become one of the fronts of the youth movement, student movement, and mass movement. The newly formed Chinese Communist Party actively intervened in the non-Christian movement in 1922 and infiltrated the Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association. It can be said that Christianity was the first religion the CCP made arrangements for and engaged with, using ‚Äúcultural invasion‚Äù as an important narrative and weapon in the anti-imperialist struggle. From the 1930s to the 40s, during the anti-Japanese resistance to the Nationalist-Communist civil war, the CCP emphasized uniting patriotic religious figures while fighting, expanding the united front according to the needs of realpolitik.</p>
<p>After the founding of New China, with the complex development of both internal and external situations, the CCP‚Äôs judgments on the situation of social revolution, the balance of power between friend and foe, the internal contradictions of the people, and changes in internal power struggles all influenced its religious policies. From the ‚ÄúNew People‚Äôs Democracy‚Äù that was emphasized in the early years to the comprehensive launch of the anti-American and aid Korea movement after intervening in the Korean War, the party engaged in a fierce struggle against imperialism (especially American imperialism) and various mass political movements closely related to it (land reform, ideological transformation, Three Anti and Five Anti campaigns). It can be said that between 1949 and 1953, although Christianity became one of the five recognized religions, it still needed to undergo innovation in the anti-imperialist struggle. Although the CCP proposed a distinction between religion and politics (imperialism), how to define the ‚Äúrunning dogs‚Äù and ‚Äútoxins‚Äù of ‚Äúimperialism‚Äù during the process of ‚Äúpoliticization‚Äù and radicalization of mass movements easily led to the problem of excessive targeting. However, in 1953, the CCP also began to realize the issues at hand and thus reaffirmed the goal of ‚Äúunity.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1953, the CCP announced the end of the new democratic phase and gradually transitioned towards constructing a socialist society. However, concerning the question of how to eliminate the exploitative classes while walking the socialist path, it opposed using ‚Äúdirect elimination‚Äù methods, advocating instead for a ‚Äúgradual transformation‚Äù approach. Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department emphasized that one should not attempt to overturn religion through atheistic propaganda, asserting that ‚Äúthe elimination of religion can only be possible when humanity has eliminated classes and greatly enhanced its ability to control nature.‚Äù In this context, the CCP understood ‚Äúeliminating religion‚Äù as a natural outcome of achieving a socialist society (i.e., natural demise). During the transitional period, religious work still focused on unity and transformation, with struggle as a supplementary aspect. The national Christian conference in 1954 proposed ‚Äúexpanding unity,‚Äù which can be seen as a concrete expression of this direction.</p>
<p>However, when ‚Äúexpanding unity‚Äù faced resistance from the spiritual faction, the CCP viewed it as an object of struggle and, through the anti-revolutionary campaign of 1955, regarded the anti-Three Self religious issue as a counter-revolutionary political issue. As a result, in 1955 and 1956, it successively dismantled the counter-revolutionary groups of Wang Mingdao and Ni Tuosheng in Christianity, and the counter-revolutionary group of Gong Pinmei in Catholicism. After the anti-revolution struggles, it successfully forced the spiritual faction opposing the Three Self Movement to join the patriotic camp.</p>
<p>In 1956, the political line of the CCP experienced a more relaxed adjustment, and Mao Zedong declared that ‚Äúlarge-scale, storm-like mass class struggles were basically over,‚Äù yet ‚Äúclass struggle had not completely ended,‚Äù thus proposing the direction of ‚Äúcorrectly handling contradictions among the people.‚Äù Against this backdrop, religion was seen as a contradiction among the people rather than that of hostile classes. At the same time, the CCP put forward the slogan ‚ÄúLet a hundred flowers blossom, let a hundred schools of thought contend,‚Äù leading to a relatively open environment for Chinese Christianity between 1956 and 1957.However, following May and June of 1957, the CCP‚Äôs judgment of the situation reversed to the anti-Rightist struggle, and the line of class struggle again dominated the CCP‚Äôs religious policy. The expansion of the anti-Rightist campaign became a large-scale political liquidation of Chinese Christianity, with most of the originally united subjects classified as ‚ÄúRightists.‚Äù</p>
<p>In China in 1958, the contradictions of friend and foe from the anti-Rightist struggle continued, while the atmosphere of ‚Äúleap forward‚Äù towards a communist society further radicalized religious work, leading to a ‚Äúpromoting weakening‚Äù approach aimed at the ‚Äúdisappearance of religion.‚Äù Under the extremely ‚Äúleft‚Äù line, the Christian system received unprecedented shocks, with many church venues closed under the pretext of ‚Äújoint worship,‚Äù and religious clergy were labeled as the ‚Äúexploiting class.‚Äù The ‚Äúno-religion zone‚Äù experiment indicated that religion had become the final target the CCP intended to ‚Äúeliminate.‚Äù</p>

<li>Christian Accusation Movement 1951-1952 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 1996: 68-72; 2012: 82-96; ÂäâÂª∫Âπ≥ 2010: 123-133; Wickeri 1990: 134-146; Bush 1970: 187-199; MacInnis 1972: 238-241)</li>

<p>After the Chinese Communist Party intervened in the Korean War, the Central Committee of the Communist Party instructed various regions on October 26, 1951, to carry out current affairs propaganda activities, emphasizing the need to unify public understanding of American imperialism, particularly to ‚Äúgenerally develop an attitude of hatred, disdain, and contempt towards American imperialism.‚Äù At the end of December 1950, a patriotic rally to resist America and aid Korea was held in Shanghai. At the meeting, Chen Qiyuan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People‚Äôs Government, pointed out that Christians must recognize the true nature of American imperialism as China‚Äôs ‚Äúnational hatred‚Äù and not believe that America is benevolent or charitable just because it established schools, hospitals, and relief efforts in China. All this work, as well as American missionaries, are tools used by American imperialism to conduct aggression under the guise of religion and Christianity. Therefore, Christians must consciously cooperate with ‚Äúthree views‚Äù (i.e., hatred, disdain, contempt), especially to ‚Äúhate‚Äù American imperialism.</p>
<p>The Communist Party has always been concerned about the imperialist ideological and cultural invasion activities. Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council, believed that because American imperialism continued ‚Äúto secretly use these organizations and groups to conduct its reactionary propaganda and activities‚Äù after the establishment of the new China, the government must eliminate its influence and ‚Äúfinally, thoroughly, forever, and completely end over a hundred years of cultural invasion by American imperialism against the Chinese people.‚Äù The Central Committee instructed various regions to ensure that cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups receiving foreign funding would ‚Äúforever detach from the influence of imperialism‚Äù and must ‚Äúlaunch a mass anti-American patriotic movement,‚Äù exposing the imperialist invasion conspiracy, while also ‚Äúholding accusations and demonstrations against American imperialism,‚Äù revealing and combating a tiny minority of reactionaries.</p>
<p>From January 16 to 25, 1951, the Second National United Front Work Conference was held in Beijing, focusing on the situation of the anti-American and aid Korea movement. Hu Qiaomu pointed out at the meeting that the ‚Äúanti-imperialist upsurge‚Äù triggered by the anti-American and aid Korea movement in China greatly promoted work in various areas and that any form of imperialist influence in China should be ‚Äúrooted out.‚Äù From March 15 to 19, 1951, the First National Religious Work Conference was held in Beijing, defining the reform movements within Christianity and Catholicism as an important part of the anti-imperialist political struggle, primarily aimed at cleansing the influence of imperialism on Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1951, the Communist Party officially convened meetings in different areas such as education, publishing, religion, and relief to initiate work on the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle. On January 15, 1951, the Ministry of Education held a meeting on ‚ÄúHandling Foreign Subsidized Higher Education Institutions.‚Äù From February 12 to 16, the Ministry of Health held a meeting in North China on ‚ÄúHandling Hospitals Receiving American Subsidies.‚Äù From March 16 to 22, the General Administration of Publishing held a ‚ÄúChristian Publishing Conference‚Äù in Beijing. From April 16 to 21, the Education and Culture Committee of the State Council held a ‚ÄúMeeting on Handling Christian Organizations Receiving American Subsidies.‚Äù From April 26 to 30, the State Council held another ‚ÄúMeeting on Handling Relief Organizations Receiving American Subsidies.‚Äù</p>
<p>Although these meetings were convened under the pretext of ‚Äúhandling American-funded institutions,‚Äù Han Wenzao, a progressive figure in the Nanjing Youth Association, pointed out that one should not ‚Äúview the problem in a bureaucratic way,‚Äù only focusing on how to request the thawing of bank deposits, procedures, etc., or understand self-reliance from an organizational perspective. He reiterated that the fundamental spirit of the State Council was ‚Äúto finally, thoroughly, forever, and completely end the cultural invasion of American imperialism against the Chinese people over the past hundred years.‚Äù In other words, this was a political struggle within the Christian community to thoroughly cleanse American imperialism. For example, Minister Ma Xulun of the Ministry of Education criticized church schools at the ‚ÄúHandling Foreign Subsidized Higher Education Institutions Meeting‚Äù as an important avenue for American imperialist ‚Äúcultural invasion.‚Äù Lu Dingyi also pointed out at the meeting that the essence of handling related issues is ‚Äúthe political struggle against American imperialism,‚Äù but during the struggle, a resolute unification policy should be adopted to help religious adherents detach from the influence of imperialism. At the ‚ÄúHandling Relief Organizations Receiving American Subsidies Meeting,‚Äù representatives from attending organizations also made a painful accusation against the brutal crimes committed under the guise of ‚Äúrelief‚Äù and ‚Äúcharity‚Äù that harmed the Chinese people and Chinese children. The representative assembly issued a joint declaration, criticizing the crimes of various relief projects organized by American imperialists.The ‚ÄúMeeting on Handling Christian Organizations Receiving American Subsidies‚Äù held in April successfully mobilized Christian leaders to speak at the accusation conference, unveiling an important chapter in the Christian accusation movement. During the six days of the meeting, two days were dedicated to holding accusation rallies. The church leaders participating in the accusations and their targets included: Â¥îÊÜ≤Á•• (Secretary-General of the Chinese Christian Church National Council), ÈÇµÈè°‰∏â (Secretary-General of the Chinese Christian Church), and ÊñΩÂ¶ÇÁíã (Student Department of the National Association of Chinese Christian Female Youth), who accused ‚ÄúAmerican imperialist‚Äù Áï¢ÁØÑÂÆá (F.W. Price); ËÉ°ÁøºÈõ≤ (Secretary-General of the Guangdong Christian Association) accused ‚ÄúAmerican agent‚Äù Èß±ÊÑõËèØ (E.H. Lockwood); Ê±üÈï∑Â∑ù (Bishop of the North China Conference of the Chinese Methodist Church) and ÊùéÁâßÁæ§ (Chongqing Chinese Lutheran Church) accused ‚Äúrunning dog of American imperialism‚Äù Èô≥ÊñáÊ∑µ; Ê±üÊñáÊº¢ (National Association of Chinese Christian Youth) accused ‚Äúrunning dog of American imperialism‚Äù Ê¢ÅÂ∞èÂàù; Èô≥Ë¶ãÁúü (Bishop of the Chinese Anglican Church) accused ‚Äúrunning dog of American imperialism‚Äù Êú±ÂèãÊºÅ; and ÁéãÈáçÁîü (Secretary of the Qingdao Christian United Association), ÈàïÂøóËä≥ (Vice President of the Hangzhou Christian Association), and Âñ¨Á∂≠ÁÜä (Vice President of the Tianjin Christian Reform Promotion Committee) accused ‚ÄúAmerican agents‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristian degenerates‚Äù È°ß‰ªÅÊÅ©.</p>
<p>To further and deepen the accusation movement, leaders of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, such as Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó, endowed the accusations with a religious rationale. He emphasized that the act of accusation was not contrary to the teachings of Jesus but was instead entirely consistent with them. Jesus himself had forcefully and profoundly accused the Pharisees. Therefore, for Christians, the accusation movement possesses the significance of ‚Äúmaking Christianity pure and the Christianity of the Chinese people‚Äù and thus demands participation as a responsibility.</p>
<p>As a national Christian organization, the association naturally took the lead in establishing a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù of accusation. On June 1, 1951, the Christian Association held a large accusation meeting with thousands of participants. The largest accusation assembly took place on June 10 at Yiyuan in Shanghai, called the ‚ÄúShanghai Christian Churches and Groups‚Äô Rally to Expose the Crimes of American Imperialism Utilizing Christianity to Invade China,‚Äù with 12,000 attendees. At the meeting, Ê±üÈï∑Â∑ù, ÈÑßË£ïÂøó, Â¥îÊÜ≤Á••, Âê≥È´òÊ¢ì, ËÉ°Á•ñËî≠ (Deputy Secretary-General of the Guangxue Association), ÂæêËèØ (President of the Chinese General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists), and Á´∫Ë¶èË∫´ (Supervisor of the Spiritual Worker Fellowship) respectively accused ‚ÄúAmerican imperialism‚Äù or ‚ÄúChiang Kai-shek‚Äôs bandits‚Äù of utilizing Methodist, Christian Female Youth, Chinese Christian Church, Guangxue Association, and Seventh-day Adventist activities for invasion. On July 27, the National Association of Chinese Christian Youth and the Female Youth also held an accusation conference.</p>
<p>In August 1951, the Preparatory Committee for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement issued a call to ‚Äúcontinue and deepen the accusation movement.‚Äù Subsequently, the accusation movement of organizations such as the Anglican Church, Christian publishing sector, Baptist Church, Methodist Church, Christian Assembly, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Self-Reliance Association, Spiritual Worker Fellowship, China Evangelical Church, and Sunday School Association in Shanghai also began to unfold one after another. The goal of the Preparatory Committee was to ‚Äúfurther expand and deepen the accusation movement into every church and among every Christian in every Christian group in Shanghai.‚Äù</p>
<p>From April to June 1951, churches and Christian groups across the country (including Shanghai, Hunan, Qiyang, Zunyi, Suzhou, Wuzhou, Luoding, Jinan, Nanjing, Hankou, Wuxi, Hefei, Shashi, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Chengdu, Taian, Songjiang, Fuzhou, etc.) held various scales of accusation meetings a total of 53 times, with participants ranging from over 60 to more than 10,000. In September 1952, on the second anniversary of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó stated that as of September 23, a total of 169 large-scale accusation meetings were held in 124 cities nationwide.</p>

<li>The Disintegration of the Jesus Family 1952 (Èô∂È£õ‰∫û 2004; ÁæÖÂÅâËôπ 2014: 676-679; Lian 2010: 64-84; Wickeri 1990: 160-162)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jesus Family was founded by Êï¨Â•†ÁÄõ in 1927 as a Chinese indigenous sect characterized by charismatic features, emphasizing a communal lifestyle (family). In 1949, there were a total of 104 ‚Äúfamilies‚Äù nationwide, with 12,000 believers. After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the Jesus Family actively supported the Three-Self Patriotic Movement‚Äôs signature campaign, with 381 members from the Jesus Family featured in the first batch of 1,527 signatures from Shandong Province. By April 1951, the number of signers from the Jesus Family reached 1,747, accounting for one-fifth of the signers in Shandong. Êï¨Â•†ÁÄõ was selected as a member of the presidium at the ‚ÄúMeeting on Handling Christian Organizations Receiving American Subsidies‚Äù convened by the State Council in April 1951.In the newly established Preparatory Committee for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, Êï¨Â•†ÁÄõ was also elected as a committee member. During the Korean War, the Jesus Family organized a volunteer medical team to resist America and aid Korea, which set off for the Korean battlefield on March 1, 1951, becoming the only Christian sect to reach the front lines.</p>
<p>At the Three-Self Patriotic Movement seminar in Tai‚Äôan in June 1951, Êï¨ was a member of the presidium, but during the meeting, accusations against the Jesus Family began to surface, and Êï¨ also made a self-accusation. Internal contradictions within the Jesus Family, particularly regarding the patriarchal system and Êï¨‚Äôs personal lifestyle issues, gradually emerged. Soon after, an accusation meeting was held at the Jesus Family‚Äôs old home in È¶¨Ëéä, where the ‚ÄúFamily Management Committee‚Äù was established, abolishing the patriarchal system. In December, Êï¨ was summoned to Shanghai for study and to address issues, during which he was required to review the history of the Jesus Family and his own actions.</p>
<p>In March 1952, the chairman of the Family Management Committee wrote a letter to Âê≥ËÄÄÂÆó, the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, reporting the internal problems of the Jesus Family and requesting that someone be sent to lead the reforms. In April, the national Three-Self organizations sent a working group led by Ê≤àÂæ∑Ê∫∂, along with Êú±Â§ßË°õ and ÈáëÂïüÊòå, to Tai‚Äôan, establishing their presence at È¶¨Ëéä with the assistance of Christian and government departments in Shandong Province. After the work team settled in, they held seminars and individual discussions, established a Learning Committee, and organized believers for study. Ê≤àÂæ∑Ê∫∂ and officials from the Tai‚Äôan Municipal Committee‚Äôs United Front Work Department gave reports on topics such as ‚ÄúHow American Imperialism Utilizes Christianity to Invade China,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Direction of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Religious Policy of the People‚Äôs Government,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Democratic Society and its Future.‚Äù In May, an exhibition was held to expose the issues of leaders like Êï¨Â•†ÁÄõ and Â∑¶È†ÜÁúü. From May 27 to 29, a three-day accusation conference was held, during which Êï¨ returned to È¶¨Ëéä with Â¥îÊÜ≤Á•• from the Preparatory Committee to accept criticism from the public. More than 120 people signed up to make accusations, and finally, 60 took the stage to accuse.</p>
<p>After the accusation conference, it was decided to ‚Äúsplit the family‚Äù of the Jesus Family, restoring 138 households based on blood relations, which were categorized into agricultural, industrial, medical, educational, and production households, among others, and redistribute properties. By October 1952, the ‚Äúfamily splitting‚Äù was completed, leading to the declaration of the Jesus Family‚Äôs ‚Äúdisintegration.‚Äù The ‚ÄúÈ¶¨ËéäËÄ∂Á©åÂÆ∂Â∫≠‚Äù was also renamed ‚ÄúÂåóÊñ∞ËéäÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÂ†Ç.‚Äù The working group announced the ‚Äúend of imperialism and reactionary feudal forces‚Äô rule and exploitation of the È¶¨ËéäËÄ∂Á©åÂÆ∂Â∫≠.‚Äù Ultimately, Êï¨Â•†ÁÄõ was arrested by the government and imprisoned in Tai‚Äôan Prison.</p>
<p>With the disintegration of the ‚Äúold family,‚Äù various ‚Äúsmall families‚Äù also began their Three-Self Patriotic Movement studies, splitting their families and dissolving existing organizations. The Jesus Family became the first Christian sect to be comprehensively ‚Äúbanned‚Äù after the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China.</p>

<li>Christian Counter-Revolutionary Group Case 1955-1956 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2010: 97-147; 2005: 121-140; Wickeri 1990: 162-170)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1955, leftist literary theorist ËÉ°È¢® faced criticism for his independent views and was soon deemed by the Central Committee as part of a ‚Äústruggle against the ËÉ°È¢® counter-revolutionary group.‚Äù This nationwide anti-ËÉ°È¢® movement further evolved into a nationwide campaign to purge counter-revolutionaries. On July 1 and August 25, the Central Committee issued directives regarding the initiation of struggles to eradicate hidden counter-revolutionaries.</p>
<p>In light of the anti-counter-revolutionary situation, the Shanghai Religious Affairs Office convened over 500 Christian representatives on June 14 for a meeting to expose the ‚ÄúËÉ°È¢® counter-revolutionary group,‚Äù demanding that the religious community disclose counter-revolutionaries. Subsequently, several Christian figures spoke, indicating the need to remain vigilant against hidden counter-revolutionaries within Christianity. On June 20, the national and Shanghai Three-Self Movement committees held a seminar to condemn the ËÉ°È¢® counter-revolutionary group.</p>
<p>On July 11, the publication „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã issued an editorial entitled ‚ÄúStrengthen Unity, Distinguish Right from Wrong,‚Äù which for the first time named and criticized ÁéãÊòéÈÅì, a Beijing Christian Church leader who publicly opposed the Three-Self Movement. His errors included: (1) fundamentally denying that Chinese Christianity was exploited by imperialism, instead claiming the toxins of imperialistic ideology were ‚Äútruths‚Äù of the Bible; (2) attempting to incite conflict between ‚Äúfundamentalists‚Äù and ‚Äúmodernists‚Äù within Christianity over beliefs, thereby undermining and eliminating the foundation of the Three-Self patriotic movement; (3) self-aggrandizing as a servant of God, judging participating Christians in the Three-Self Movement as ‚Äúspiritually degenerate‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-believers.‚Äù Therefore, in response to ÁéãÊòéÈÅì‚Äôs ‚Äúdisruption of anti-imperialism and patriotism under the guise of faith,‚Äù the editorial called on patriotic Christians to ‚Äúclear the boundaries of right and wrong with Mr.&nbsp;Wang Mingdao from the perspective of anti-imperialism and patriotism‚Äù and actively engage in the struggle.</p>
<p>On July 4, 1955, the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle movement began in Beijing, requiring all students attending the Christian church to report and denounce issues related to Wang‚Äôs activities.On August 5, the Shanghai Religious Affairs Office convened religious leaders to study materials related to the ‚ÄúËÉ°È¢® counter-revolutionary group.‚Äù Director ÁæÖÁ´πÈ¢® reiterated that religious individuals must ‚Äúeliminate counter-revolutionaries from within the church.‚Äù He described the counter-revolutionaries in the religious community as primarily ‚Äúappearing with pious and enthusiastic facades,‚Äù while in reality, they were merely ‚Äúdisguised in religious garb‚Äù to deceive the faithful. ÁΩó‚Äôs report marked the commencement of the counter-revolutionary struggle in the religious community.</p>
<p>In the early morning of August 8, ÁéãÊòéÈÅì and his wife were arrested at home, along with approximately 20 others in Beijing, È¶ôÂ±±, Èï∑Êò•, and Âª£Â∑û. On August 15, „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã published a short commentary titled ‚ÄúExposing the Reactionary Words and Actions of Wang Mingdao,‚Äù calling for the ‚Äúdecisive exposure of Wang Mingdao‚Äôs reactionary actions and an immediate distancing from him.‚Äù After Wang‚Äôs arrest, from August to November, Three-Self organizations and churches across the country launched a campaign against the ‚ÄúWang Mingdao counter-revolutionary group,‚Äù with „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã printing numerous articles critiquing Wang. Shortly thereafter, ÊûóÁçªÁæî, a ‚ÄúWang Mingdao element‚Äù in Guangzhou, was arrested, and a campaign against the ‚ÄúShanghai version of Wang Mingdao‚Äôs reactionary rhetoric‚Äù ‚Äî„ÄäËÅñËÜè„Äã‚Äî was initiated in Shanghai. In October and November, theËµÑÊñôÂÆ§ of „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã compiled collections titled ‚ÄúExposing the Reactionary Words of Counter-Revolutionary Wang Mingdao‚Äù and ‚ÄúAccusations Against the Wang Mingdao Counter-Revolutionary Group,‚Äù thoroughly critiquing Wang and his associates.</p>
<p>After his arrest, Wang succumbed to threats and pressure, confessing to the government. On September 29, 1956, he was granted ‚Äúeducational release‚Äù for his willingness to repent and agree to participate in the Three-Self Movement. However, having not fulfilled his commitment, both Wang and his wife were arrested again on April 29, 1958. In April 1961, the Beijing People‚Äôs Procuratorate formally charged them under the ‚ÄúCounter-Revolutionary Punishment Regulations.‚Äù In July 1963, the Beijing Intermediate People‚Äôs Court sentenced Wang Mingdao and ÂäâÊôØÊñá to life imprisonment and a 15-year fixed-term sentence for counter-revolutionary crimes. Wang Mingdao‚Äôs appeal was rejected in September by the Beijing Higher People‚Äôs Court Criminal Appeals Division, which upheld the original verdict.</p>
<p>The case of the ‚ÄúWang Mingdao counter-revolutionary group‚Äù became a focal point of the counter-revolutionary struggle within the Christian community, marking the government‚Äôs shift in focus toward those church hardliners who refused to participate in the Three-Self Movement based on their differing faith. At that time, apart from Wang Mingdao, the Christian Assembly was also one of the most organized and populous elements of the anti-Three-Self camp, undoubtedly becoming the next target of the government.</p>
<p>Starting in mid-January 1956, leaders of Christian assemblies in places such as Hunan (ÈïøÊ≤ô, Ë°°Èò≥, Ê†™Ê¥≤, Â∏∏Âæ∑, ÊÖàÂà©, ÊπòÊΩ≠, etc.), Guangdong (ÂπøÂ∑û), Zhejiang (Êù≠Â∑û, ÂÆÅÊ≥¢, Ê∏©Â∑û, Âπ≥Èò≥, ËêßÂ±±, ÂÆÅÊµ∑, ÁëûÂÆâ, ÈªÑÂ≤©, ÈáëÂçé, Á£êÂÆâ, ÁªçÂÖ¥, ÂòâÂÖ¥, ÂòâÂñÑ, etc.), and Fujian (Á¶èÂ∑û, Âé¶Èó®, Ê≥âÂ∑û, ÊôãÊ±ü, ËéÜÁî∞, Á¶èÊ∏Ö, ÈóΩ‰æØ, Á¶èÈºé, Âè§Áî∞, ËøûÂüé, Êº≥Êµ¶, etc.) were successively arrested by public security authorities on counter-revolutionary charges. This was followed by a comprehensive accusation meeting calling on the Christian community to denounce the counter-revolutionaries hidden within the assemblies, with participants from local assemblies coming forward to join the accusations. A nationwide campaign to rectify the assemblies thus began.</p>
<p>As the center of the national assembly, the Shanghai Assembly also became a target for rectification on January 29, 1956. That evening, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau arrested ÊùéÊ∑µÂ¶Ç, Ê±™‰Ω©Áúü, ÂºµÊÑö‰πã, ËóçÂøó‰∏Ä, among others, officially announcing the dismantling of the ‚ÄúÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ counter-revolutionary group‚Äù within the Shanghai Assembly. On January 30, the Shanghai Religious Affairs Office held a meeting to declare the crimes of the ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ counter-revolutionary group, attended by over 2,500 Christians. From February 8 to 19, a crime exhibit was held concerning the ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ counter-revolutionary group, with nearly 10,000 Shanghai believers visiting. From February 21 to 24, the exhibition was extended to include believers from other local assemblies. In February 1956, multiple editions of„ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã featured detailed reports on this topic and reprinted several accusation documents. On February 22, a grand meeting of all assembly believers took place at the ÂçóÈôΩË∑Ø assembly to accuse the ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ counter-revolutionary group‚Äôs crimes, attended by over 3,000 participants, including representatives from Nanjing, Changsha, and Xuzhou.</p>
<p>On June 21, 1956, the Beijing Higher People‚Äôs Court tried the ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ counter-revolutionary case. ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ admitted to the charges in court. Ultimately, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and deprived of political rights for five years. In October 1958, the Beijing Higher People‚Äôs Court sentenced ÊùéÊ∑µÂ¶Ç and Ê±™‰Ω©Áúü to 15 years and ÂºµÊÑö‰πã to 12 years, respectively. One of their charges included conducting ‚Äúcounter-revolutionary activities intensified following ÂÄ™‚Äôs arrest.‚Äù Other assembly members arrested across the country also faced sentencing in 1958.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ had already been arrested by the government in April 1952.From 1953 to 1955, various assemblies across the country engaged in anti-Three-Self struggles under the pretext of faith, which, in fact, had no substantial relationship with ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤, and he could not assume a leadership role in these anti-struggles. The counter-revolutionary group case related to the Christian Assemblies in 1956 still bore the name ‚ÄúÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤,‚Äù partly because of his significant position within the assemblies, leading the government to view him as the head of the counter-revolutionary group; on the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party sought to utilize the various accusations against ÂÄ™, especially concerning his moral issues, as a critical weapon to undermine the assemblies. The high-profile trial of ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤ during the anti-counter-revolutionary campaign (in contrast to ÁéãÊòéÈÅì) and the public disclosure of his crimes indeed inflicted tremendous, even fatal, damage to the assemblies.</p>

</ol>
<p>During the Great Leap Forward, the national Three-Self organizations proposed to thoroughly change the semi-colonial appearance of Christianity by implementing ‚Äúunited worship‚Äù in August 1958. Prior to this, Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province had already decided to merge in a Three-Self expanded meeting held in May, planning to implement the merger from July. According to the regulations, all denominational names were to be canceled, personnel unified, with no distinction of sects, and property and finances centralized. Initially, among the 17 churches in the urban area, 6 were allowed to remain open, corresponding to the 6 original denominations: ÂüéË•øÂ†Ç (originally Methodist), ÊªÑÊ≤≥Â∑∑Â†Ç (originally Self-Reliance Association), Ëä±ÂúíÂ∑∑Â†Ç (originally China Inland Mission), Ê∞∏ÂÖâÂ†Ç (originally Jesus Self-Reliance Association), È†≠Ê¢≥ËÖ¶Â†Ç (originally Seventh-day Adventist), Ë•øÂüé‰∏ãÂ†Ç (originally Assembly).</p>
<p>The model of united worship quickly spread from Wenzhou to various parts of the country. Grassroots congregations from different denominations adopted a method of uniting with other congregations in the same region, significantly reducing the number of grassroots congregations.</p>
<p>According to Ê≤àÂæ∑Ê∫∂, a member of the national Three-Self Standing Committee, in the summer of 1958, the head of the Religious Affairs Bureau, ‰ΩïÊàêÊπò, mentioned to him in Shanghai the concept of ‚Äúfly-free cities‚Äù and ‚Äúfly-free countries‚Äù proposed in various places in Beijing during the Great Leap Forward. ‰Ωï believed that ‚Äúin terms of religion, could we create a ‚Äònation free of religious activities‚Äô throughout China?‚Äù Following this, ‰Ωï visited Wenzhou for inspection, and Ê≤à believed that the later ‚Äúleftist errors‚Äù regarding religion in Wenzhou were closely related to this visit. Ê≤àÊâÄÊåáÁöÑÔºåÊ≠£ÊòØ Wenzhou‚Äôs early implementation of united worship, and the subsequent establishment of the ‚ÄúNo Religion Experimental Zone.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Wenzhou ‚ÄúNo Religion Experimental Zone‚Äù materialized in Wenzhou‚Äôs subordinate counties: Âπ≥ÈôΩ, Ê∞∏Âòâ, Ê¥ûÈ†≠, ÁëûÂÆâ, and ËíºÂçó, where all religious activities were essentially halted during the Great Leap Forward. All churches were closed, rather than merged. In the urban area of Wenzhou, the initial 6 opened churches for united worship were further merged down to only ÂüéË•øÂ†Ç.</p>
<p>The summary report on religious work from Wenzhou in 1959 stated: ‚ÄúIn the city, one Catholic church, one Christian church, and one Buddhist temple will continue to be retained for proper religious activities, while all suburban churches have halted services indefinitely. No public interference will be conducted regarding household gatherings, nor will they be officially recognized; efforts will be made to monitor the situation, actively promote education and persuasion, and remain vigilant against disruptive elements spreading rumors‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>The Wenzhou ‚ÄúNo Religion Experimental Zone‚Äù reflects the beginning of the CCP‚Äôs policy to ‚Äúeliminate‚Äù religion during the Great Leap Forward. This policy would later be implemented nationwide during the Cultural Revolution.</p>

<li>Suppression of the True Jesus Church 1958-59 (Inouye 2018: 208-210; ÈÑßËÇáÊòé 1993: 2-19)</li>
</ol>
<p>During the Great Leap Forward, the True Jesus Church became one of the sects heavily targeted and impacted. The True Jesus Church is an indigenous Christian sect in China, founded in 1917. In March 1951, the True Jesus Church held its 12th General Assembly, where it formulized a reform program expressing a commitment to enhance political education and pursue aid for Korea. In April, Wei Yisai, as president, attended the ‚ÄúMeeting on Handling Christian Organizations Receiving American Subsidies‚Äù convened by the State Council and co-signed a joint declaration. In early 1952, Wei Yisai conducted a self-critique expressing his intent to participate in the Three-Self Movement. In March 1953, the General Assembly issued notices to various regions to study the Three-Self reform declaration, resulting in over 13,000 believers signing by September. In April, the True Jesus Church General Assembly Committee for the Three-Self Reform Movement Preparatory Committee was established, and the General Assembly moved its headquarters from Beijing to Wuhan, with the national president and vice-president (Ëî£Á¥ÑÁø∞ and ÂäâÂùáÂÆâ) elected as president and vice-president. During this period, Wei Yisai faced criticism.</p>
<p>In May 1958, Zhang Zhiyi, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, mentioned the need to eliminate the True Jesus Church during a specialized religious work meeting. This suggestion was quickly relayed to various provinces.On June 5, 1958, a specialized religious work conference in Sichuan Province addressed related issues and required local authorities to ‚Äúassess the situation.‚Äù In January 1959, the province decided to start in Chongqing, where the congregation was concentrated, operating under unified leadership from the party committee. A joint working group composed of the United Front, public security, and religious affairs departments was formed, followed by the establishment of cooperative groups at the county level for unified actions against the True Jesus Church. By the end of May, the campaign had essentially ‚Äúdefeated and discredited the True Jesus Church, achieving the expected objectives,‚Äù with the ‚Äústruggle reaching a conclusion.‚Äù For example, in Chongqing, among 135 key members of the district assembly, a total of 82 were targeted (16 arrested, 34 under control, 2 sent for labor re-education, 10 struggled against, and 20 faced public review and debate criticism).</p>
<p>In May 1958, the national Three-Self Movement began simultaneous criticisms of the True Jesus Church. After „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã published reports on the ‚Äúillegal activities‚Äù of the True Jesus Church in Hubei, it emphasized, particularly in an ‚Äúeditorial,‚Äù that such ‚Äúcriminal activities against the Party, socialism, and the people‚Äù must not be tolerated. In June, following reports on the illegal activities of the True Jesus Church in Hanyang, Hubei, „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã included a ‚Äúshort commentary‚Äù and reprinted an article from the Hubei Christian Socialist Education Study Committee denouncing the True Jesus Church. In July, „ÄäÂ§©È¢®„Äã published letters from readers at the True Jesus Church in Beijing, calling for a denunciation of the reactionary group led by Ëî£Á¥ÑÁø∞ at the General Assembly of the True Jesus Church.</p>
<p>During the Great Leap Forward, the True Jesus Church was the only sect specifically named and subjected to unprecedented political purging. This may be attributed to its tightly organized national structure and strong ‚Äúcharismatic‚Äù tradition. Additionally, the True Jesus Church‚Äôs ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù view of the church, asserting itself as the only ‚Äútrue‚Äù church, led to its classification as a detrimental element to unity, even though it participated in the Three-Self Movement, resulting in a comprehensive crackdown. After the implementation of united worship, all denominational organizations ceased operations, and congregations were required to merge with other sects. However, some scholars suggest that the True Jesus Church was still able to develop in an underground state.</p>
