<li>‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì (Wickeri 2007; Wei Keli 2022; Xing Fuzeng 2013: 2-3)</li>
</ol>
<p>‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì (K. H. Ting, Ding Guangxun, 1919-2012), originally from Dinghai, Zhejiang, was born into an Anglican family in Shanghai. He graduated from St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University in Shanghai in 1937 with a Bachelor of Arts. After graduation, he worked as a staff member in the student department of the YMCA and assisted the Shanghai Christian Student Union (Shanghai Lian). From 1940 to 1942, he studied theology again at St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University. After graduating, he was ordained as a deacon by the Anglican Church and served as an assistant pastor at St.&nbsp;Savior‚Äôs Church. From 1943 to 1946, he served as the pastor of the Shanghai International Church. Between 1946 and 1951, he went abroad, serving successively as a staff member of the Canadian Student Christian Movement (1946-47) and the World Student Christian Federation in Geneva, Switzerland (1948-51). During 1947-48, he attended the Teachers College at Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary in New York, earning a Master of Religious Education.</p>
<p>In September 1951, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì returned to China with his wife ÈÉ≠ÁßÄÊ¢Ö and son. From 1952, he served as the general secretary of the Shanghai Guangxue Society, participating in the preparation of the United Theological Seminary in July. In December 1952, he became the president of Nanjing Jinling United Theological Seminary. In 1954, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was established, and he was elected as a standing committee member. In 1955, he was consecrated as a bishop by the Zhejiang Diocese of the Chinese Anglican Church, being one of the last bishops to be consecrated by the Chinese Anglican Church in China. In 1956, he attended the Lambeth Conference of the Worldwide Anglican Communion and was present at the World Council of Churches Assembly. In 1961, he was elected as the youngest vice-chairman of the national Three-Self Movement during the Second National Christian Conference.</p>
<p>After the Cultural Revolution, he became a leader of Chinese Christianity, serving as the chairman of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and president of the China Christian Association from 1980 to 1996. After the Jinling United Theological Seminary reopened, he continued to serve as its president until he retired in 2010. During this time, he also served as the director of the Institute of Religious Studies at Nanjing University and as vice-president of Nanda. In 1985, he initiated the establishment of China‚Äôs first Christian-background charitable organization, the ‚ÄúAmity Foundation,‚Äù and served as its chairman.</p>
<p>In terms of political participation, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì served as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) for three terms (1959-65), as a representative in the National People‚Äôs Congress (NPC) for three terms (1964-75) and four terms (1975-78). After the 1980s, he held positions as a standing committee member of the CPPCC for five terms (1978-83), NPC representative for five terms (1978-83), and standing committee member of the NPC for six terms (1983-87) and seven terms (1988-92). In March 1989, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the seventh CPPCC and served as vice-chairman of the eighth (1993-98), ninth (1998-2002), and tenth (2003-08) CPPCC.</p>
<p>After the Cultural Revolution, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì, in his capacity as a leader of the National Two Sessions of Christianity, focused on church reconstruction and development with the goal of ‚Äúdoing a good job in the church.‚Äù He created more favorable conditions for ‚Äúdoing a good job in the church,‚Äù establishing frameworks and platforms for church construction, particularly resisting ‚Äúleftist‚Äù forces from both the government and within the church, and focusing on ‚Äúunity‚Äù to handle the relationship between the government and the church, as well as relations among different traditions and factions within the church. In the 1980s, he expressed opinions on the implementation of religious policies at NPC and CPPCC meetings as a representative and standing committee member, advocating for the NPC to pass legislation guaranteeing religious freedom. During the 1989 pro-democracy movement, he issued statements in support of the student movement. Following the ‚ÄúJune Fourth‚Äù incident, after aligning closely with the central government‚Äôs policies, he was unable to continue serving in the NPC but largely retained other positions.</p>
<p>After ‰∏Å stepped down from leadership in the National Two Sessions in 1996, he proposed that ‚Äútheological thought construction‚Äù is the most fundamental and important aspect of ‚Äúdoing a good job in the church.‚Äù At this point, he set aside the principle of ‚Äúunity‚Äù that he had upheld in the 1980s and 1990s, advocating for the renewal and adjustment of theological thoughts in response to the prevalence of conservative ‚Äúold‚Äù theology in the Chinese church. In the ‚Äútheological thought construction‚Äù movement launched in 1998, ‰∏Å became the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù figure of theological thought construction, and his theological ideas almost dominated the entire direction of the discussions.However, due to the political orientation of the theological thought construction (guiding Christian theology to ‚Äúadapt to socialist society‚Äù) and the approach taken as a ‚Äúpolitical movement,‚Äù combined with theological positions that ‚Äúdiminish justification by faith,‚Äù conservative Christians grew concerned about the emergence of a ‚Äúunified‚Äù theology, which suppressed the ‚Äúfundamentalist (evangelical)‚Äù faction. As a result, a significant degree of ‚Äúfactionalism‚Äù appeared within the Chinese church, leading to various degrees of resistance even within the Two Sessions. Ultimately, after celebrating the tenth anniversary of theological thought construction in 2008, the national Two Sessions gradually made adjustments. Due to health issues, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì only delivered a ‚Äúwritten‚Äù speech at this celebration.</p>
<p>He passed away on November 22, 2012, in Nanjing. The obituary published by Xinhua News summarized his life as ‚Äúan outstanding patriotic religious leader, a renowned social activist, and a close friend of the Communist Party of China,‚Äù fully reflecting the close relationship between religion, society, and politics throughout his life. At the two farewell ceremonies held on November 27 (one non-religious and one Christian), his body was covered with both the national flag and a cross-shaped shroud, highlighting his long-standing dual identity.</p>

<li>Ê≤à‰ª•Ëó© (Ê≤àÊâøÊÅ© 1994: 10-11; ANS 1994: 8)</li>
</ol>

In 1944, under the care of Ê≤àÂ≠êÈ´ò, he received a calling, abandoned his plans to study engineering, and dedicated himself to the church, entering Jinling University to major in philosophy, laying a foundation for future theological training. Due to his excellent academic performance, he was awarded the ‚ÄúGolden Key‚Äù honor. His graduation thesis was on ‚ÄúThe Concept of Knowledge in Greek Philosophy.‚Äù After graduating in 1948, he entered the Central Theological Seminary of the Anglican Church. In 1951, he graduated and worked as a preacher in the Church of All Saints in Shanghai. In November 1951, he participated in the first cadre study class of the Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Additionally, he served as the deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai Youth Federation and actively participated in its work.</p>
<p>He was ordained as a deacon in 1952, became a priest in 1954, and served as secretary of the General Synod‚Äôs standing committee and a pastoral assistant to the chief bishop from 1955 to 1958. After the implementation of united worship in 1958, he served as the vice-chairman of the United Worship Preparatory Committee in Changning District and Jing‚Äôan District, and as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee in Xuhui District. In 1978, he became a teacher at the Workers‚Äô University of Shanghai Watch Industry Company.</p>

In 1986, he was appointed vice-president of the China Christian Association, and in 1988 he was consecrated as a bishop in Shanghai. In 1991, he was elected vice-president and secretary-general of the China Christian Association. He was seen as a potential successor to Bishop ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì.</p>
<p>In 1982, the Christian Hymn Committee was established, and Shen became a committee member. After the Theological Education Committee was formed in 1987, he served as its chairman, responsible for planning theological education in China, organizing the compilation of the ‚ÄúChinese Theological Education Series,‚Äù and establishing a theological education fund. He was also involved in the review of Christian entries for the Chinese edition of the ‚ÄúConcise Encyclopedia Britannica.‚Äù</p>
<p>In addition, he served as a board member of the National Association of the Chinese YMCA, East China Theological College, and the Amity Foundation, as well as the vice-chairman of the Shanghai Christian Affairs Commission. He was also a representative in the eighth Shanghai Municipal People‚Äôs Congress, a standing committee member of the seventh Shanghai Political Consultative Conference, and a member of the eighth National Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>Since 1980, he primarily published articles on Chinese theology, the Three-Self Movement, theological education, and contemporary religious and Christian developments. After his death, the two national Christian associations compiled his works into ‚ÄúPulpit Service‚ÄîCollected Works of Bishop Shen Yifan (Volume One)‚Äù (1996) and ‚ÄúVoices from the Forum‚ÄîCollected Works of Bishop Shen Yifan (Volume Two)‚Äù (2004).</p>
<p>He passed away from heart disease in August 1994.</p>

<li>ÈÑ≠Âª∫Ê•≠ (Ê≤à‰ª•Ëó© 2004: 354-358; ÊõπËÅñÊΩî 2001: 46-48; ÈÑ≠Âª∫Ê•≠ 1982: 119-137; Wickeri: 2007: 179)</li>
</ol>
<p>ÈÑ≠Âª∫Ê•≠ (Cheng Chien-yeh, 1919-1991), originally from Wuhu, Anhui. His father ÈÑ≠ÂíåÁî´ was the bishop of the Henan diocese of the Chinese Anglican Church and the first Chinese person to serve as the chairman of the bishops‚Äô board. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, his family moved from Henan to the Shanghai International Settlement. In 1939, he enrolled at Soochow University, majoring in sociology. In 1942, he transferred to St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University to study philosophy and theology. After graduating in 1944, he worked as a moral education officer at the Shanghai YMCA. After the war, he served in the student department and religious department and, at the invitation of Wu Yaoczong, participated in the Tianfeng Society, assisting with the editing of the Tianfeng Weekly.In 1946, he was ordained as a bishop (pastor). In 1948, he went to the University of Toronto in Canada to study theology. In October 1949, before completing his studies, he returned to China to resume his work as editor-in-chief at the Tianfeng Society. When Âê¥ËÄÄÂÆó launched the signature campaign for the Three-Self Reform Declaration, ÈÑ≠Âùá participated and played an important role in promoting it. From 1951 onwards, he was involved in the church work in Henan, serving as the general secretary of the Henan Diocese. In 1952, he was consecrated as the deputy bishop of Henan Diocese, and the following year he was transferred from the Henan Diocese of the Anglican Church to serve as the executive secretary of the General Committee of the Chinese Anglican Church. At just 33 years old, ÈÑ≠Âª∫Ê•≠ had no long-term experience serving in the church, yet in a short span of six years, he was consecrated as a bishop and took on significant leadership roles as the executive secretary, which was indeed an extraordinary personnel arrangement.</p>
<p>When the Three-Self Movement was initiated, ÈÑ≠Âª∫Ê•≠ was one of the 40 founders. In 1951, the preparatory committee for the Three-Self Reform was established, where he served as a committee member and head of the liaison group. In 1954, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was formed, and he served as a standing committee member for the first and second sessions. After 1958, he participated in historical documentation work. During the Cultural Revolution, he traveled to Beijing to petition but was accused of being a ‚Äúcow demon and snake spirit‚Äù and faced even harsher criticism. ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì indicated that the persecution against ÈÑ≠ was led by ÊùéÂÑ≤Êñá.</p>
<p>In 1980, ÈÑ≠Âª∫Ê•≠ strongly promoted the establishment of the China Christian Association, later serving as its vice-president and executive secretary. He played an important role in addressing the issues of mutual respect among different original denominations following the ‚Äúsectarian period.‚Äù In the standing committee meeting of the national Two Sessions in 1987, he contributed to a resolution to consolidate unity, based on his analysis: (1) a wide range of fellow workers participated in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement; (2) all colleagues cooperated with the aim of seeking common ground while allowing for minor differences in faith, practicing mutual respect without attacking one another; (3) all parties agreed to no longer identify with their original religious labels or establish sects, nor to restore original religious organizational systems or engage in sectarian international connections or publish sectarian literature without authorization.</p>
<p>In the early days of the establishment of the China Christian Association, ÈÑ≠ organized the writing of ‚ÄúQuestions and Answers on Key Doctrines‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristian Volunteer Training Course Materials,‚Äù and also participated in editing ‚ÄúNewly Compiled Hymns.‚Äù In the field of religious theory research, he opposed equating the essence of religion with ‚Äúopium,‚Äù and served as a visiting researcher at the Institute of World Religions of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He was elected as the vice-president and academic advisor of the Shanghai Religious Studies Association. He participated in the hosting and writing of the ‚ÄúDictionary of Religions,‚Äù ‚ÄúSea of Words,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúReligion Volume of the Encyclopedia of China.‚Äù</p>
<p>He passed away on April 11, 1991, after several years of illness.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Èô≥Êæ§Ê∞ë (ÂäâËã•Ê∞ë 2006: 135-140)</li>
</ol>
<p>Èô≥Êæ§Ê∞ë (Chen Zemin, 1917-2018), born into a Christian family in Shantou, Guangdong, had a grandfather who was one of the first preachers in the area. In 1937, he enrolled at Hujiang University, majoring in sociology with minors in music and theology. After graduating in 1941, he attended Jinling Theological Seminary (Shanghai) for further studies. During his time at Hujiang and Jinling, he was greatly influenced by Âê¥ËÄÄÂÆó and met ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì while interning at the Shanghai YMCA. After graduating from the seminary in 1944, he worked as the director of the religious social service department at Fukang Hospital in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, until August 1950, when he transitioned to teaching at Jinling Theological Seminary. His six years of experience in Shaoxing was later compiled into a book titled ‚ÄúCloud Pillar and Fire Pillar,‚Äù published by Shanghai Guangxie Press in 1950.</p>
<p>In November 1952, Jinling Theological Seminary merged into Jinling United Theological Seminary, where he continued to teach and served as associate dean and dean over time. From 1982 to 2002, he served as vice-president. He taught at Jinling for over half a century, mainly covering courses in systematic theology, history of Christian thought, pastoral theology, and church music. He officially retired from Jinling United Theological Seminary in June 2013.</p>
<p>With the launch of the ‚ÄúJinling United Theological Journal‚Äù in 1953, ÈôàÊæ§Ê∞ë began to contemplate the issue of constructing Chinese theology. He published articles such as ‚ÄúThe Mission of Theological Construction in the Chinese Church‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Church‚Äôs Witness and Theology.‚Äù He believed that before 1949, ‚ÄúOld China‚Äù never established a true ‚ÄúChinese Church,‚Äù and theological thinking was often constrained by the West; it was only after the establishment of New China that there was an awakening from ‚Äúpoverty.‚Äù He pointed out that theology must understand ‚Äúthe environment in which we exist‚Äù and then ‚Äúunderstand ourselves.‚Äù Therefore, how should Christianity respond to the changes brought about by ‚ÄúNew China‚Äù? What is the relationship between faith and reality? Is the real world (including the new Chinese society) lovable? What is the relationship between believers and non-believers? Are the good deeds of non-believers accepted by God? Does God execute His justice and love through those who do not believe? Is there a contradiction between patriotism and love for religion? These questions became essential considerations in the theological reflections of New China that could not be overlooked. After the Cultural Revolution, Èô≥Êæ§Ê∞ë continued to reflect on the construction of Chinese theology.</p>
<p>In addition to theological reflection, Èô≥Êæ§Ê∞ë also had a passion for music.In 1981, the China Christian Two Sessions established a hymn work group (which was renamed as the Hymn Committee the following year), and Èô≥ participated in the editing of ‚ÄúNew Hymns.‚Äù He also edited volumes 1 to 4 of ‚ÄúJinling Hymn Selection‚Äù and issues 1 to 5 of ‚ÄúHua Xia Hymns.‚Äù Additionally, he composed hymns with Chinese characteristics such as ‚ÄúSong of God‚Äôs Marvelous Work‚Äù and ‚ÄúResurrection Morning.‚Äù He advocated that hymns must ‚Äúintegrate culturally‚Äù within contemporary contexts, and ‚ÄúNew Hymns‚Äù represented a practice by the Chinese church in this regard.</p>
<p>While serving in theological education, Èô≥Êæ§Ê∞ë was the senior pastor of Nanjing St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs Church from 1985 to 1995. He also served as the vice-president of the China Christian Association, vice-president of the Jiangsu Christian Association, and a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Political Consultative Conference for its fifth and sixth sessions, as well as the vice-president of the Chinese Association for Religious Studies.</p>
<p>In 1993, he edited ‚ÄúSelected Theological Works of Jinling.‚Äù In 2007, the China Christian Two Sessions published ‚ÄúExploration and Testimony‚ÄîSelected Works of Chen Zemin.‚Äù He passed away on June 4, 2018, at the age of 101.</p>

<li>Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© (Wang Weifan, 1927-)</li>
</ol>
<p>Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó©, originally from Taizhou, Jiangsu, was well-versed in traditional Chinese classics from a young age and later encountered modern writers such as È≤ÅËøÖ and Â∑¥Èáë. In 1940, he entered Taizhou County Middle School, beginning his Western-style education. In 1946, he was admitted to the Department of Navigation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University but dropped out due to family reasons and returned to Taizhou to teach at the Meide Church Primary School. During this time, the missionary Á±≥È∫óËèØ (Marguerite Mizell) from the Southern Presbyterian Church evangelized to him, and he was baptized in the summer of 1947. In 1948, he entered the education department at Nanjing Central University, where he participated in the ‚ÄúNational Christian Students‚Äô Union,‚Äù frequently meeting at the Huangnigang Church in Nanjing. Influenced by Pastor Ê•äÁ¥πÂîê, he experienced repentance and rebirth in the fall of 1949. In 1951, he decided to leave school for Hangzhou to attend the China Theological Seminary (Missionary Society background), serving as president of the student council. In 1952, after the Hangzhou Theological Seminary merged into Jinling United Theological Seminary, he transferred to continue his studies in Nanjing. He graduated from Jinling United Theological Seminary in 1955 and served as a pastor at the Baptist Church in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. In 1957, he returned to Nanjing to assist with the editing of ‚ÄúHoly Light.‚Äù In 1958, he was labeled a ‚Äúrightist‚Äù and underwent three years of forced labor at Qixia Mountain in Nanjing. From 1961 to 1966, he worked as an English teacher at Nanjing No.&nbsp;33 Middle School. In 1966, he was impacted by the Cultural Revolution. From 1971 to 1979, he labored at a steel window factory in Nanjing, holding various positions including worker, production scheduler, steel window technician, and production section chief. After the Jinling United Theological Seminary reopened in 1980, he returned to teach, also serving successively as the associate editor of ‚ÄúCorrespondence Textbooks,‚Äù editor of ‚ÄúJinling Theological Journal,‚Äù associate dean, person in charge of student work, and head of the Jinling Writing Studio until his retirement in 1999.</p>
<p>In 1979, prior to the reopening of Jinling United Theological Seminary, Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© was assigned to work at the Institute of Religious Studies at Nanjing University (where ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì also served as vice-president), assisting in editing ‚ÄúReligion.‚Äù ‚ÄúReligion‚Äù became one of the earliest religious studies journals published in China after the Cultural Revolution and played a significant role in exploring religious theory. As an editor of ‚ÄúReligion,‚Äù Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© was dedicated to promoting the ideological liberation of religious issues, contributing to the normalization of religious work within the ideological sphere. He pointed out that the role of religion during the socialist period could not be summarized by the ‚Äúopium theory.‚Äù While religion may have played some negative roles in history, it should not overshadow ‚Äúthe positive aspects of religion under certain conditions,‚Äù especially its constructive role in the ‚Äúconstruction of spiritual civilization within socialism.‚Äù</p>
<p>As a member of the established Chinese church, Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© considered the relationship between the government and the church. He remarked that ‚Äúthe long-standing formation of unified leadership‚Äù led to the issue of ‚Äúthe separation of church and state.‚Äù He criticized local government departments for being ‚Äúoverly controlling, interfering too much, and restricting the normal religious activities under the leadership of religious organizations.‚Äù He believed the fundamental key lay in ‚Äúregulating the relationship between government and religion from a political system perspective,‚Äù specifically ‚Äútransforming the functions of the relevant departments.‚Äù At the same time, he supported the reform of the Three-Self Organization to change its functions, enabling it to effectively manage the church according to the Three-Self principles, stating, ‚ÄúThere is no longer a need for an institution to continue leading the Three-Self Movement,‚Äù and that a ‚Äúchurch-oriented organization‚Äù should function as the church leadership system. This upgrade was necessary as ‚Äúthe Three-Self‚Äù organization could no longer undertake the historical mission of ‚Äúattracting a wide range of believers.‚Äù Thus, ‚Äúthe Chinese church can truly become a church, and Christ can genuinely be the head of the Chinese church.‚ÄùFor those Christian meeting points that did not participate in the Two Sessions, Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© opposed the ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù approach of categorizing all unapproved Christian activities as ‚Äúunderground forces‚Äù and ‚Äúillegal,‚Äù leading to their elimination or closure. He believed that such actions would only hurt the feelings of the religious community.</p>
<p>Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© can be considered one of the earliest spiritual leaders in China to identify as ‚Äúevangelical,‚Äù actively participating in the Three-Self establishment. For a long time, he maintained a close relationship with ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì, sharing many views during the 1980s and 1990s. However, in 1999, significant differences arose between Ê±™ and ‰∏Å regarding the issue of theological thought construction, forcing him to retire from Jinling Theological Seminary. Despite this, he continued to express dissent regarding the ‚Äúdiminishing of justification by faith‚Äù in various settings. His words and actions undoubtedly represent a practice of the spiritual or evangelical faction in the contemporary political and religious landscape of China.</p>
<p>Ê±™Á∂≠Ëó© was a prolific author, with key works included in the volumes published by ÂÆóÊñáÁ§æ, ‚ÄúTwenty Years of Gloom‚Äù and ‚ÄúTen Years of Struggles.‚Äù He passed away on September 15, 2015, due to illness.</p>

<li>Ë¢ÅÁõ∏Âø± (Yuan Xiangchen, 1914-2005)</li>
</ol>
<p>Ë¢ÅÁõ∏Âø± (Allen Yuan) was originally from Dongguan, Guangdong, born in Bengbu, Anhui, with the original name Ë¢ÅÊåØÈÇ¶. He received traditional education from an early age, with a private tutor who changed his name to Ë¢ÅÁõ∏Ëá£. In 1923, his family moved to Tianjin, where he attended a new school, later transferring to a school run by the YMCA in Beijing. In 1930, while in high school and influenced by new ideas, he rejected the name ‚ÄúÁõ∏Ëá£,‚Äù changing ‚ÄúËá£‚Äù to ‚ÄúÂø±.‚Äù During his studies, he became acquainted with ÁéãÊòéÈÅì through his teacher Áü≥Â§©Ê∞ë, a co-worker of ÁéãÊòéÈÅì. On the night of December 29, 1932, he repented for his sins and experienced rebirth. In August 1933, he was baptized by ÁéãÊòéÈÅì. Shortly afterward, during a meeting led by Pastor Ê≠¶ÁÜôËÄÉ of the Shandong Spiritual Meeting, he experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and resolved to testify for Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1934, Ë¢Å made the decisive choice to abandon his studies and entered the Far East Bible Institute in Beijing to study theology. In the summer of 1936, he attended the second Bible study conference hosted by ÂÆãÂ∞öÁØÄ in Gulangyu, Xiamen. After graduating in 1938, he served at the Holy Fellowship Church in Tianjin. The following year, he returned to Beijing to work as a translator at the Far East Bible Institute. In the summer of 1940, he felt a calling to leave Beijing and worked with American missionary Pastor Ë£¥ to develop outreach in rural areas in Cheng‚Äôan County, Hebei. In the summer of 1945, he returned to Beijing due to his mother‚Äôs serious illness. In March 1946, Ë¢ÅÁõ∏Âø± opened an evangelistic hall near the White Pagoda Temple at No.&nbsp;160 Fuchengmen, initially preaching on the street, after which the numbers began to grow, reaching over 200 people by 1949.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Ë¢ÅÁõ∏Âø± refused to participate in the Three-Self Movement, citing a lack of connections to foreign missions and differing beliefs. In 1957, he was labeled a rightist. On April 19, 1958, he was arrested for ‚Äúcounter-revolutionary‚Äù activities. After being detained at the Caolanzi Hutong detention center and undergoing six months of interrogation, he was transferred to Beijing Prison. In November 1958, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. In June 1960, he was sent to Heilongjiang Province to serve his sentence at Xingkai Lake Prison. In the spring of 1962, he was transferred to the Gezhi Prison in Zhaoyuan County, Nenjiang. On December 23, 1979, he was released on parole to Beijing but had his political rights revoked for ten years. From the time of his arrest in 1958, he spent 21 years and 8 months in prison.</p>
<p>After his release, Ë¢ÅÁõ∏Âø± began hosting Bible study classes in his home near the White Pagoda Temple and subsequently held Sunday services. Due to his refusal to participate in the Three-Self Movement, he continued to face official pressure. In October 1989, after regaining his citizenship, he visited ‰∏äÊµ∑ to meet with ÁéãÊòéÈÅì. In 1994, American evangelist Billy Graham visited the White Pagoda Temple and preached. In 1995, he was invited by the U.S. government to attend a morning prayer meeting at the White House, which he politely declined. In August 1996, he ceased church meetings at the White Pagoda Temple due to his refusal to register with the government. However, worshippers continued to gather every Sunday.</p>
<p>He passed away on August 16, 2005, at the age of 92.</p>

<li>ÊûóÁçªÁæî (Lin Xianjiao, 1924-2013)</li>
</ol>
<p>ÊûóÁçªÁæî (Samuel Lamb) was born into a Christian family in Macau. His father, Êûó‰øùÁæÖ, studied at Nyack College and taught at the Guangxi Wuzhou Bible School. His name means ‚ÄúDedicated to the Lamb of Christ.‚Äù When he was five, his family moved to Guangzhou, where he graduated from Meihua Primary School. In the summer of 1936, he was baptized in Changzhou and continued his education in Hong Kong. After the fall of Hong Kong in December 1941, he fled to Zhao Xing in Guangdong and later moved to Liantang. In 1942, Êûó entered the preparatory program at Wuzhou Bible School, and after one year, he advanced to the full program.In 1944, due to the war, the Bible school was closed, and ÊûóËøÅÂéªÈπèÂåñ. He returned to Wuzhou after the war, and under the introduction of principal ÂäâÁ¶èÁæ§ (Willian Newbern), he served as an assistant pastor at the Wan Shan Church of the Chinese Christian Church in Guangzhou. In 1946, he transferred to serve as a pastor at the Zion Church of the Chinese Christian Church in Guangzhou. At this time, the Bible school resumed classes, but Êûó chose not to return to continue his studies in order to dedicate more time to serving. During this period, he began editing ‚ÄúThe Voice of the Wilderness‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpiritual Sound Quarterly.‚Äù In 1948, dissatisfied with the new pastor‚Äôs liberal theological stance, he transferred to serve at the Xinghua Baptist Church.</p>
<p>In April 1950, Êûó began holding meetings at No.&nbsp;35, Zhongshan Wulu Bus Station, calling it ‚ÄúBus Station Gospel Hall,‚Äù with about 30 attendees. This location was a house purchased by his grandfather many years earlier. In October, he was invited to lecture by the Changzhou Divine Bible School in Hong Kong and was encouraged to stay in Hong Kong, but Êûó decided to return to Guangzhou. In February 1953, he visited the Christian Church in Beijing to meet ÁéãÊòéÈÅì. After reading Áéã‚Äôs book ‚ÄúIn the Fiery Furnace and Lion‚Äôs Den,‚Äù Êûó was greatly impressed by Áéã‚Äôs commitment to truth during the Japanese occupation, and he proactively corresponded with Áéã. Êûó stayed in Beijing until March before returning to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>In August 1955, ÁéãÊòéÈÅì was arrested during the crackdown on counter-revolutionaries. On the evening of September 14, more than ten public security officers arrived at the Bus Station Church and detained Èô≥ and two coworkers (ÁéãÂúãÈ°Ø and ÂºµËÄÄÁîü). Later, the Guangzhou ‚ÄúSouthern Daily‚Äù reported under the headline ‚ÄúA Counter-Revolutionary Group Led by ÊûóÁçªÁæî, ÁéãÂúãÈ°Ø, and ÂºµËÄÄÁîü Was Disbanded.‚Äù On September 27, the Three-Self Movement convened a meeting to accuse the ‚ÄúBus Station Counter-Revolutionary Group.‚Äù On December 18, Êûó was moved to a detention center and was released at the end of January 1957. In February 1958, Êûó participated in the ‚ÄúSocialist Education Movement‚Äù conference. On the night of May 30, he was arrested again. On November 20, Êûó was convicted of ‚Äúcounter-revolutionary activity, pro-imperialism, anti-Soviet actions, and being an accomplice of ÁéãÊòéÈÅì,‚Äù receiving a 20-year sentence.</p>
<p>In January 1959, ÊûóÁçªÁæî was sent to the Tea Mountain Farm in Shaoguan, Guangzhou, for labor reform. In July 1963, he was transferred to the Xiyuzhai Coal Mine in Taiyuan, Shanxi. He was released on May 29, 1978, initially designated as ‚Äúawaiting relocation,‚Äù and was granted approval to return to Guangzhou on June 15.</p>
<p>After returning to Guangzhou, Êûó taught English at home and resumed leading family gatherings, beginning the writing and publication of the ‚ÄúSpiritual Sound Series.‚Äù In May 1979, he published his first book after release, ‚ÄúOnce Saved, Always Saved,‚Äù and later composed over 30 hymns. In September 1979, meetings at the Bus Station resumed with only 4 to 5 attendees initially; as attendance increased, they built a roof for gatherings. By 1981, he was preaching on the third floor, while the second floor broadcast sermons using speakers, with 2,000 participants attending weekly. Various ministries were established, including children‚Äôs gatherings, Bible study classes, youth meetings, and visitation teams.</p>
<p>On December 6, 1982, government authorities ordered Êûó to halt gatherings, citing an additional five years of deprived political rights, which lasted until May 29, 1983. During this six-month period, due to renovations, large gatherings were suspended until the conclusion of his sentence. After this period, Êûó gradually resumed meetings. Between August and December 1988, the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau had six discussions with Êûó, demanding he cease all gatherings and join the ‚ÄúThree-Self Patriotic Organization.‚Äù The conversations focused not only on registration but also on relations with overseas churches, funding operations, and ‚Äúillegal‚Äù publications. Êûó argued that household church activities did not violate religious freedom policies or laws, asserting that the church was capable of self-support and that outsiders should not intervene in its ‚Äúautonomy.‚Äù Thus, he refused to join the ‚ÄúThree-Self Convention.‚Äù</p>
<p>On the evening of February 22, 1990, after a meeting concluded, dozens of public security officers executed a search warrant at the Bus Station gathering place, confiscating microphones, tape recorders, Bibles, and hymnals, and taking Êûó away. He was accused of violating the ‚ÄúAdministrative Regulations on Religious Activity Venues in Guangdong Province‚Äù by not applying for registration with the religious authorities. Êûó was labeled as an illegal preacher, and the Bus Station was declared an illegal preaching site and shut down. He was released after 21 hours of detention. Êûó maintained that the church adhered to the law and did not violate national laws and regulations; the constitution guarantees citizens the freedom of religious belief, and law does not require participation in the ‚ÄúThree-Self‚Äù organization; the church has the ability to sustain itself without external interference in its governance. Therefore, he refused to stop meetings and refused to register. After his detention, the Bus Station held only prayer meetings until it resumed regular gatherings in March 1991. From March 1990 to January 1991, he was interrogated more than ten times, pressured to register, attend training sessions, undergo ideological education, and provide updates on relations with the outside world and church activities.In 2001, due to the demolition of the Bus Station, the meeting location was relocated to No.&nbsp;15, Ronggui Lane, which increased the available space to accommodate 800 people, maintaining weekly gatherings of 3,000 attendees. Between 2003 and October 2013, the Bus Station Church faced significant scrutiny over issues related to church registration, emergency exits, fire safety, the ‚ÄúEastern Lightning‚Äù cult, SARS, and other matters.</p>
<p>On August 3, 2013, ÊûóÁçªÁæî passed away due to illness, resting in the Lord‚Äôs embrace at the age of 89.</p>

<li>ÂæêÊ∞∏Êæ§ (Peter Xu, 1940-)</li>
</ol>
<p>ÂæêÊ∞∏Êæ§, originally from Zhenping County, Nanyang City, Henan Province, was born into a Christian family. After graduating from a technical school for the railway system in 1962, he was assigned as a technician at the Datong Mining Bureau. Due to his evangelism activities, he was reported to superiors and was ‚Äúcleansed‚Äù during the ‚ÄúFour Cleanups‚Äù movement, enduring four months of detention and interrogation. Because Âæê insisted on his faith, he became a target of criticism after the Cultural Revolution. In November 1967, he decided to escape from Datong City, initially returning to his hometown in Zhenping, Henan, praying for the revival of the church in China.</p>
<p>He later moved to a brick factory in Zao City, Hubei Province, where he continued to preach to seasonal workers, which drew attention from the military management committee, prompting him to flee overnight and return to Henan to continue his evangelism.</p>
<p>In 1979, he was rehabilitated and returned to the Datong Mining Bureau, but he chose to continue his ministry. At that time, the Three-Self Organization had resumed operations, but Âæê was determined not to follow the Three-Self path. Influenced by the teachings of ÂÆãÂ∞öÁØÄ regarding rebirth, he emphasized repentance and confession. After fasting and praying with his coworkers, he began preaching on repentance, resulting in many believers weeping and praying to God in confession, which formed the tradition of church gatherings centered on a training system called ‚ÄúThe Way of Life.‚Äù Participants attended a ‚ÄúLife Conference‚Äù lasting 3 to 6 days, during which some would experience the Holy Spirit and weep. From 1985 onward, they held ‚ÄúField Theological Schools‚Äù lasting three months, focusing on the theme of ‚Äúrebirth,‚Äù thus being nicknamed the ‚ÄúRebirth Faction.‚Äù Other churches, observing the emotional reactions of attendees during their gatherings, referred to them as the ‚ÄúCrying Faction.‚Äù Their meetings were termed ‚ÄúFull-Scope Meetings,‚Äù leading the Chinese government to often label them as ‚ÄúFull-Scope Churches.‚Äù</p>
<p>In August 1982, Âæê and his coworkers were arrested. After spending 100 days in detention, he escaped and continued preaching in rural areas. Other coworkers were sentenced for ‚Äúcounter-revolutionary propaganda, illegal preaching, and disturbing social order.‚Äù In 1983, Âæê and other coworkers established churches in various locations throughout Henan Province and later moved to Hubei to avoid government capture. In 1988, he was arrested while attempting to meet American evangelist Billy Graham in Beijing and was sentenced to three years of labor education, being released on April 26, 1991.</p>
<p>The Three-Self Church‚Äôs criticism of the ‚ÄúRebirth Faction‚Äù was notably harsh, with ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù publishing multiple articles denouncing them as a ‚Äúheretical cult.‚Äù The book ‚ÄúUphold the Truth, Resist Heresy,‚Äù published by the National Two Sessions of Christianity, included them on a list of cult organizations. However, the China Gospel Fellowship, which had assisted in training, pointed out that while individuals within the Rebirth Faction may hold some ‚Äúextreme‚Äù views, it did not constitute heresy overall. In March 1997, Âæê was arrested for the third time and sentenced to three years. Later, due to his acceptance of differing rebirth testimonies from other church believers, disputes arose within the church, leading some adherents of the original teachings of the Rebirth Faction to believe Âæê had deviated. In 2001, Âæê was granted asylum in the United States as a political refugee.</p>

<li>ÂºµÊ¶Æ‰∫Æ (Zhang Rongliang, 1951-)</li>
</ol>
<p>ÂºµÊ¶Æ‰∫Æ was born in Fangcheng County, Henan, where he came into contact with Christianity during the Cultural Revolution and was baptized in 1969. Concurrently, he was appointed by the Guaihe Dui Brigade to the Jiaozhi Railway construction site as the militia company commander, leading over 100 laborers in preparations for the railway. Due to his excellent performance and his poor peasant background, he was groomed by the commune leadership to join the Communist Youth League and appointed as the militia battalion commander. In July 1970, he even took an oath to join the Communist Party, serving as the deputy secretary of the Party branch in Wangzhuang Brigade. At that time, he believed that Christianity‚Äôs emphasis on faith and going to heaven did not contradict the Communist goal of building a socialist society in this life.</p>
<p>In May 1971, Âº† was discovered during a gathering by the militia. The commune secretary required him to write a self-criticism, promising that he could keep his role as long as he expressed a renunciation of faith. However, Âº† stubbornly refused to abandon his beliefs and was consequently placed under party surveillance. Following the Lin Biao incident in September 1971, the Communist Party began a cleanup within its ranks.In May 1974, the Guaihe Commune forced 21 Christians (including Zhang Rongliang) to the county seat for a study session aimed at persuading them to abandon their faith, inciting them to denounce one another, which led to Zhang being reported by others. The study session lasted for over a month, during which Zhang remained steadfast in his faith. In June, he was formally arrested and expelled from the Communist Party. In January 1976, he was sentenced to seven years and sent to a labor reform camp in Xihua County, Henan. In 1977, he met ÈæçÂª∫Âúã (Feng Jianguo) at the same labor camp, and the two became acquainted, praying and communicating with each other. They also formed a secret small fellowship with several other believers.</p>
<p>In January 1980, Zhang was released early and had his counter-revolutionary label removed. After his release, he observed the revitalization of churches in various places and decided to dedicate himself to ministry, clearly stating that he would not join the Three-Self Church. The initial coworkers included ÈÑ≠Êõ∏Ë¨ô, Áî∞ÊïèÈñ£, ‰∏ÅÁßÄÁé≤, and Âñ¨Êò•Áé≤.</p>
<p>Between 1983 and 1984, over 40 preachers from the Fangcheng Church were arrested and sentenced for ‚Äúillegal cross-province preaching and disturbing social order.‚Äù Zhang Rongliang became wanted and established churches in various places. The church centered in Fangcheng gradually embarked on cross-border missionary work. In 1994, as the church expanded across China and was no longer limited to Fangcheng, it renamed itself ‚ÄúChina for Christ Church,‚Äù using Fangcheng as the mother church and establishing teams in Fangcheng East, Fangcheng West, Nanyang, Zhuma Station, Wuyang, and Sanmenxia (all located in Henan Province), as well as teams in Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>After the 1990s, Zhang Rongliang was imprisoned four times: from September 1990 to May 1991, February 1994, August 1999 to February 2000, and December 2004 to August 2011.</p>
<p>He authored the book ‚ÄúThe Apostles of Fire: Modern Acts of the Apostles in China‚Äù (2015).</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>È¶ÆÂª∫Âúã (Feng Jianguo, 1926-2012)</li>
</ol>
<p>È¶ÆÂª∫Âúã was born into a peasant family in Tanghe County. As a child, he fell ill and, having found no help from doctors, sought assistance from the church. The church elder guided him to abandon the ‚Äúidols‚Äù in his home, and after prayer, he recovered from his illness, leading the entire family to turn to the Lord. Following that, Feng attended a local school run by the Missionary Society, became a believer in 1938, and began preaching by 1944. In 1975, Tanghe County organized a theory study class for proletarian dictatorship, motivating Christians to abandon their faith. In October, Feng was arrested by the police and detained for 13 months in the Tanghe Tianye Temple Jail. He was subsequently sentenced to five years for ‚Äúreligious counter-revolution.‚Äù In 1977, he was transferred to the W53 Labor Reform Farm in Xihua County and was released starting in 1980.</p>
<p>After his release, Feng Jianguo refused to join the Three-Self Movement and traveled around preaching, forming a nine-member team centered in Tanghe to spread the gospel throughout Henan. In 1983, during a crackdown by the Henan authorities, he hid in the mountainous areas of Tongbai County. In 1988, inspired by the vision of ‚Äúspreading the gospel throughout China,‚Äù he decided to establish the ‚ÄúChina Gospel Fellowship,‚Äù serving as the head of the fellowship.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the China Gospel Fellowship expanded from primarily Henan-based churches into other provinces, witnessing rapid growth. In 1993, it established various mission agencies such as Enan (led by ÈÇ¢ÈáëÁî´), Yu‚Äôan (led by Áî≥Áæ©Âπ≥), Yu‚Äôdong (led by È≠èÈáëÊ™î), and Ebei (led by Áî≥Áæ©Âπ≥). They also initiated the slogan ‚ÄúOne penny for missions, two knees for prayer, and one life for sacrifice in missions.‚Äù In March of the following year, they sent a ‚ÄúBrave Death Squad‚Äù of 70 people for nationwide missions, meaning ‚Äúto die to oneself, to die for the world, to die for the devil, and to die for the environment.‚Äù</p>
<p>In September 1996, Feng Jianguo, ÁæÖËã±, ÈÇ¢ÈáëÁî´, and ÂºµË°° were arrested in Tanghe County as part of a special action by the Henan provincial government; they were sentenced to labor reform for two to three years. By this time, the China Gospel Fellowship had expanded to 17 mission agencies. In 1999, they began promoting evangelism among migrant workers in urban areas, shifting the church‚Äôs focus from rural to urban ministry.</p>
<p>He passed away in September 2012 at the age of 86.</p>

<p>China Christian Population (Ying 2009: 81)</p>
<p>The figures for the Christian population in China during the 1980s relied mainly on announcements from the Chinese government. According to Document No.&nbsp;19 issued in 1982, the Christian population was 3 million. Due to a lack of data since the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, it can only be compared with the 1.03 million collated by the China National Society for the Promotion of Christianity in 1950. This shows that from the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China to 1982, the number of Christians in China increased from 1.03 million to 3 million over a span of 32 years, resulting in a growth rate of 191.26%. Despite experiencing various political movements from the 1950s to the 1970s, particularly the ‚Äúcounter-religion‚Äù policies during the Cultural Revolution, Christianity still managed to achieve such growth, indicating that it can no longer be classified simply as a ‚Äúforeign religion‚Äù but can be viewed as an indigenous religion rooted in China. At the same time, the figure of 3 million Christians surely does not reflect the situation after the reform and opening up in 1979, instead indicating a certain degree of revival for Christianity in underground status towards the later stages of the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>China Christian Council, 1980 (Xing Fuzeng 1999: 79-84)</li>
</ol>
<p>The 1980 Shanghai Conference proposed the need to establish a religious organization outside the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee. This ‚Äúis a service organization,‚Äù primarily aimed at providing services to churches and believers across the country. The religious organization born from this initiative was officially established at the third national conference and named the ‚ÄúChina Christian Council.‚Äù Its charter does not publicly proclaim its acceptance of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People‚Äôs Government like the Three-Self organization does; instead, it emphasizes ‚Äúuniting all Christian believers in China who worship the one true Father and recognize Jesus Christ as Lord, under the leadership of the same Holy Spirit, according to the same Bible, working together to establish our country‚Äôs self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating churches.‚Äù To foster unity, the Council particularly stressed mutual respect in faith and does not seek uniformity, hoping to gain as much support and recognition from believers of different faith traditions as possible.</p>
<p>At that time, some within the Chinese church questioned the need to establish a religious organization outside the Three-Self Patriotic Organization. Some suggested placing the religious work within the national Three-Self Patriotic Organization as its subsidiary department or committee. There were also concerns that setting up an independent religious organization ‚Äúcould dilute the flag of Three-Self patriotism.‚Äù Ding Guangxun stated at the third national conference: ‚ÄúHow can an organization with such a purpose (referring to the Three-Self organization and its political purpose) constantly and long-term make the various works of the church its mission? If many pastoral and religious tasks we envision are handed over to the Three-Self organization, then the Three-Self will have to put in a lot of effort to do pastoral and religious work, which would actually change the nature and purpose of this organization. If so, it would dilute the principles and requirements of Three-Self patriotism.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the understanding at that time, there was ‚Äúno question of who leads whom‚Äù between the Three-Self organization and the religious organization, as the Three-Self‚Äôs main concern was anti-imperialist patriotism, advocating independent and self-run churches, focusing on the issues of Chinese churches‚Äô self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation; whereas the Council deals with questions of governance, support, and transmission. The relationship between the two was ‚Äúcomplementary.‚Äù</p>
<p>The China Christian Council and the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee are collectively referred to as the ‚ÄúTwo Councils of Christianity.‚Äù</p>

<li>Amity Foundation, 1985 (Yao Xingfu 2018: 444-448; Laliberte, Palmer &amp; Wu 2011: 145-146; Wickeri 2007: 271-278)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Amity Foundation was established in April 1985 and is the earliest civil charity organization initiated by Chinese Christians after the reform and opening up, with participation from various sectors of society. The name ‚ÄúAmity‚Äù comes from the Latin word for love ‚ÄúAmo,‚Äù and in English it is Amity, which takes meaning from the biblical verse: ‚ÄúLove binds all virtues together.‚Äù The founder is Ding Guangxun, a Chinese Christian leader and vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference, while the Secretary-General was Han Wenzao, the leader of the Nanjing Three-Self organization. Ding Guangxun also serves as the chairman of the board.</p>
<p>In the early stages of its establishment, Han Wenzao pointed out that the functions of the Amity Foundation are: (1) to hope to play a proactive role in the development of Chinese society; (2) to hope for Christians‚Äô participation to be recognized widely by the Chinese people; (3) to strengthen the sharing of resources among the global church and the interpersonal relationships internationally. Initially, the foundation supported a center for child mental health research in Nanjing and recruited foreign teachers to teach at Chinese higher education institutions through overseas churches or other organizations.With the development of its ministries, various projects were launched across the country concerning community development and environmental protection, public health and AIDS prevention, disaster management, educational assistance for orphans, social welfare, church and social services, education and international exchanges, as well as capacity building for social organizations. The areas of work involved eight major categories: medical and health services, social welfare, education for the visually impaired, rural poverty alleviation and comprehensive development, ecological protection, and women‚Äôs development.</p>
<p>In November 1986, with the donation from the United Bible Society, the Amity Foundation established the ‚ÄúNanjing Amity Printing Plant‚Äù (renamed ‚ÄúNanjing Amity Printing Co.&nbsp;Ltd.‚Äù in June 1988), which is the only printing factory authorized by the Chinese government to print Bibles. In September 1989, the one millionth Bible was printed, in December 2000, the 25 millionth, in December 2007, the 50 millionth, and in November 2010, the 80 millionth. By July 2012, the 100 millionth Bible had been printed, and by 2019, the figure reached 200 million. The Bibles printed by Amity are primarily supplied to Christian and Catholic churches and believers in China, and they also print Bibles for various countries around the world.</p>
<p>The donations to the Foundation mainly come from church organizations, businesses, and individuals both domestically and abroad. From 1985 to 2010, a total of 1.5 billion RMB was raised in donations.</p>

</ol>
<p>The founder of Fangchang Church is Zhang Rongliang, who was born in 1951 in Fangcheng County, Henan. He came into contact with Christianity during the Cultural Revolution and was baptized in 1969. Due to his enthusiasm for evangelism, he was imprisoned in 1974 and sentenced to seven years in 1976. During the Cultural Revolution, he was held in the same labor camp as Feng Jianguo from Tanghe Church. In 1980, after being released early, Zhang returned to evangelism and clearly stated his refusal to participate in the Three-Self Church. The initial co-workers included Zheng Shuoqian, Tian Minge, Ding Xiuling, and Qiao Chunling.</p>
<p>Between 1983 and 1984, more than 40 preachers from Fangchang Church were arrested and sentenced on charges of ‚Äúillegal missionary activities across provinces and counties, disturbing social order.‚Äù Zhang Rongliang was wanted and continued to establish churches in various locations. The development of the Fangchang team has similarities with the Tanghe team. Both affirmed their stance of not participating in the Three-Self organization and were influenced by Bao Dening, leading to a stronger charismatic tendency. The church also centered around Fangchang and gradually embarked on cross-border missions.</p>
<p>In 1994, as the church expanded across China and was no longer limited to Fangchang alone, it was renamed ‚ÄúChina for Christ Church,‚Äù making Fangchang the mother church, and there were Eastern and Western teams from Fangchang, Nanyang team, Zhuma Zhan team, Wuyang team, Sanmenxia team (all located in Henan Province), as well as teams from Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Yunnan.</p>

<li>The Word of Life Church (Reborn faction or Full-Scope Church) (Zhang Yinan 2010: 18-30; Xin 2009; Su &amp; Allan 2021: 68-70)</li>
</ol>
<p>The founder of The Word of Life Church is Xu Yongze. Xu was born in 1940 into a Christian family in Nanyang and had already been engaged in evangelism during the Cultural Revolution. By the early 1980s, Xu Yongze had established a firm stance of not participating in the Three-Self organization. In 1982, under the influence of the Chinese evangelist Song Shangjie, Xu began to emphasize repentance and confession. After fasting and praying with his co-workers, he preached about repentance, leading many believers to weep and pray for forgiveness under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This led to the formation of a church meeting tradition centered around ‚ÄúThe Word of Life,‚Äù involving a training system where believers attend a ‚ÄúLife Meeting‚Äù lasting 3 to 6 days, during which some experience the Holy Spirit and weep. Since 1985, they held ‚Äúfield seminaries‚Äù lasting three months. Their emphasis on being ‚Äúborn again‚Äù earned them the nickname ‚ÄúReborn faction.‚Äù Other churches began to call them the ‚ÄúCrying faction‚Äù due to the expressiveness of believers weeping during meetings. Their gatherings are referred to as ‚ÄúFull-Scope Meetings,‚Äù hence the Chinese government often refers to them as ‚ÄúFull-Scope Churches.‚Äù</p>
<p>In August 1982, Xu and his co-workers were arrested. After escaping 100 days into his imprisonment, he continued to preach in rural areas. Other co-workers received prison sentences on charges of ‚Äúcounter-revolutionary propaganda incitement, illegal missionary activities, and disturbing public order.‚ÄùIn 1983, Xu and other co-workers established churches in several locations in Henan Province, later relocating to Hubei Guangyue to continue their missionary work to evade official capture. In 1988, he was arrested when he went to Beijing to meet the American evangelist Billy Graham, who was visiting China, and was sentenced to three years of labor re-education, being released on April 26, 1991.</p>
<p>The Three-Self Church‚Äôs criticism of the ‚ÄúReborn faction‚Äù is particularly notable, with ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù publishing multiple articles denouncing it as a ‚Äúheretical sect.‚Äù The book ‚ÄúUpholding the Truth, Resisting Heresy,‚Äù published by the National Committees of Christianity, also included it in the list of cult organizations. However, the China Evangelical Fellowship, which has assisted with training, pointed out that while some individuals within the Reborn faction may have ‚Äúextreme‚Äù tendencies, overall, it does not constitute heresy. In March 1997, Xu Yongze was arrested for the third time and sentenced to three years. Later, Xu‚Äôs acknowledgment of differing experiences of being born again among other church believers led to internal controversies, with a faction of original Reborn leaders believing that Xu had deviated from the Reborn teachings. In 2001, Xu Yongze resided in the United States as a political refugee.</p>

<li>China Gospel Fellowship, 1988 (Zhang Yinan 2010: 10-11; Koesel 2013: 577-584; Su &amp; Allan 2021: 75-78)</li>
</ol>
<p>The China Gospel Fellowship is one of the three major household church teams in Henan, located in Tanghe County under Nanyang City. Key founding members include Feng Jianguo, Shen Yiping, Shen Xianfeng, and Xing Jinfu, and it was initially referred to as ‚ÄúTanghe Church.‚Äù In 1988, the ‚ÄúChina Gospel Fellowship‚Äù was officially established, with Feng Jianguo as the general leader of the fellowship. In 1988, Hong Kong‚Äôs Bao Dening (Dennis Balcombe) introduced the charismatic tradition. After its establishment, co-workers expanded churches throughout Henan Province and Hubei, with the gospel spreading from Nanyang to Anhui, Hubei, and even Sichuan, leading to the establishment of more churches. By the early 1990s, the China Gospel Fellowship had expanded its focus beyond Henan Province to other provinces, experiencing rapid development, particularly involving contact with overseas entities, charismatic traditions, and cross-regional missions, inevitably provoking official suppression. Many co-workers (Shen Yiping, Wei Jindang, Lian Changnian) were subsequently imprisoned.</p>
<p>In 1993, regional associations such as E‚Äônan (led by Xing Jinfu), Yu‚Äôan (led by Shen Yiping), Yu Dong (led by Wei Jindang), and E‚Äôbei (led by Shen Yiping) were established. They also proposed the slogan, ‚ÄúOne penny for mission offerings, a pair of knees for mission prayers, a life given for missions.‚Äù The following March, they dispatched a ‚Äúsuicide squad‚Äù of 70 people for national missions, implying ‚Äúdying to oneself, dying to the world, dying to the devil, and dying to the environment.‚Äù</p>
<p>In September 1996, Feng Jianguo, Luo Ying, Xing Jinfu, Zhang Heng, and others were arrested in Tanghe County as part of a special operation by the Henan provincial government, resulting in sentences ranging from two to three years of re-education through labor. At this time, the China Gospel Fellowship had developed into 17 regional associations.</p>
<p>In 1999, they began to promote evangelism among migrant workers in urban areas, shifting the church‚Äôs focus from rural development to urban outreach.</p>

<li>Shanghai Conference 1980 (Zhao Tian‚Äôen, Zhuang Wanfang 1997: 312-313)</li>
</ol>
<p>From February 25 to March 1, 1980, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee held a Standing Committee (expanded) meeting in Shanghai, marking the official resumption of rebuilding work for the Chinese church. This meeting is referred to as China‚Äôs ‚ÄúJerusalem Conference,‚Äù where 37 representatives gathered once again after the Cultural Revolution. Zhang Zhiyi, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, also attended this meeting. In his opening speech, Ding Guangxun set the tone for the future rebuilding and development of the Chinese church: ‚ÄúThe achievements of the Three-Self are significant; the tasks of the Three-Self are not completed; we cannot be satisfied with the Three-Self.‚Äù</p>
<p>The meeting decided to convene the third national Christian conference and concluded that: (1) the Bible should be reprinted and published, hymns and spiritual books compiled and the publication of ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù should be resumed; (2) the Jinling Union Theological Seminary in Nanjing should be reopened to train clergy, and correspondence courses and regional short-term theological training classes should be organized; (3) a ‚ÄúChurch Affairs Agency‚Äù should be established, specifically to handle church affairs, complementing the Three-Self organization.</p>
<p>On the last day of the meeting, the Standing Committee of the Three-Self issued a ‚ÄúLetter to Brothers and Sisters in the Lord Countrywide,‚Äù which, in addition to the aforementioned three points, affirmed the party‚Äôs religious policies, reiterating: ‚ÄúThe achievements of the Three-Self are significant; the tasks of the Three-Self are not completed; we cannot be satisfied with the Three-Self.‚Äù</p>
<p>This meeting can be said to have prepared for the third national conference of Chinese Christianity.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Third National Conference of Chinese Christianity 1980 (Zhao Tian‚Äôen, Zhuang Wanfang 1997: 314-318; Xing Fuzeng 1999: 76-81)</li>
</ol>
<p>From October 6 to 13, 1980, the Third National Conference of Chinese Christianity was held in Nanjing, 20 years after the second national conference. A total of 176 representatives from 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended the conference, and Zhang Zhiyi, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department, and Xiao Xianfa, Director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, also spoke at the conference.</p>
<p>At the third national conference, Ding Guangxun delivered an opening speech titled ‚ÄúReview and Outlook,‚Äù which included three main themes: the great achievements of the Three-Self, the unfinished tasks of the Three-Self, and the church needing not only to manage itself but also to do well. First, Ding emphasized that ‚ÄúThree-Self‚Äù is absolutely undeniable from both historical and practical considerations. Historically, the Three-Self Movement has achieved significant success over thirty years of practice. Chinese Christians have become patriotic Christians because of this movement, and Chinese Christianity has thus freed itself from the control and exploitation of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, becoming a religious organization of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, ‚Äúin line with the appearance of the socialist new China.‚Äù In other words, ‚Äúthe Three-Self has gradually changed the perception of various peoples towards Chinese Christians and Chinese Christianity.‚Äù Christianity is no longer seen as a ‚Äúforeign religion,‚Äù and Christians are no longer seen as overly Westernized or dependent on foreign teachings. These are all significant achievements of the Three-Self Movement. These great achievements also demonstrate the ‚Äújustness, rationality, and necessity‚Äù of the Three-Self Movement. Therefore, Ding stated: ‚ÄúOpposing the Three-Self is not only a lack of patriotism but also a denial of the Christian gospel work, which undermines Christianity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Secondly, Ding pointed out that although the accomplishments of the Three-Self are great, the tasks are far from completed and must be consolidated, ‚Äúto defend, to expand, to develop,‚Äù and continue the Three-Self movement. He noted that many new believers still lack understanding of the Three-Self movement, especially mentioning foreign organizations that openly promote ‚Äúunderground preaching,‚Äù attempting to develop ‚Äúunderground churches‚Äù in China, which are actually ‚Äúsubversive activities against us.‚Äù Meanwhile, in many places, the implementation of the policy of religious freedom still faces difficulties, and the Three-Self organization must continue to assist the government in this work.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Ding emphasized the need to ‚Äúmove from self-managed churches to well-managed churches.‚Äù What the Three-Self emphasizes is ‚Äúself,‚Äù and now it further requires ‚Äúto manage well, nurture well, propagate well.‚Äù He acknowledged that the church had not done well in pastoral work in recent years, and in some places, the truth of Christ had been misrepresented and not comprehensive enough. Therefore, while continuing to engage in the patriotic work of the Three-Self, there is also a need to care for the sheep and run the Lord‚Äôs church well. He specifically mentioned the urgent need to publish the ‚ÄúBible‚Äù and other publications, to quickly restore the Jinling Union Theological Seminary, and to establish a Christian affairs organization that is, like the Three-Self organization, a patriotic and religious group, ‚Äúeach with its own focus.‚Äù He reiterated, ‚ÄúOn any issues involving faith, our principle is mutual respect, not interfering with beliefs or unifying beliefs.‚Äù</p>
<p>In conclusion, Ding focused on international relations. He stated that the Chinese church should take its own unique path, but ‚Äúthis does not exclude beneficial international exchanges.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnyone who respects our independence and autonomy and treats us equally‚Äù can develop friendly mutual assistance and cooperative relationships.But if there are attempts to ‚Äúpull Chinese Christianity back to a colonial state,‚Äù aiming to split the Chinese church and ‚Äúforce us to abandon the Three-Self path,‚Äù then vigilance must be raised.</p>
<p>In his opening speech, Ding Guangxun proposed to summarize the history of the Three-Self Movement over the past thirty years and establish the role of the Three-Self Movement under the tasks of the new era in light of the current challenges faced by the Chinese church.</p>

<li>First Batch of the Bible Published After the Cultural Revolution 1980 (Ta Kung Pao 1981)</li>
</ol>
<p>In October 1980, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee reprinted the first batch of the ‚ÄúNew Testament‚Äù after the Cultural Revolution, while the ‚ÄúOld and New Testaments‚Äù were also published at the end of 1980. The reprinted version was based on the 1919 ‚ÄúUnion Version‚Äù of the Bible. A spokesperson for the national Three-Self stated that the costs for this reprint were entirely borne by the Chinese church, while the State Administration for Religious Affairs and the National Publishing Bureau also assisted in purchasing paper and providing printing conditions. The first batch of Bibles had a print run of 135,000 copies. The spokesperson also mentioned that a small number of people abroad harbor hostility towards China and use the issue of the Bible to spread rumors, ‚Äúpromoting the idea of supplying us with Bibles or raising huge sums to smuggle Bibles into China, which is an overt infringement of our country‚Äôs and our church‚Äôs sovereignty. They deceive overseas believers out of their money, create anti-China sentiment, and attempt to control the Chinese church, pushing it back into a colonial state, which Chinese Christians and the Chinese people cannot tolerate.‚Äù</p>

<li>Revision of the Chinese Translation of the Bible 1980 (Ding Guangxun 1981: 9; National Christian Two Conferences 1981: 61; Wang Shenyin 1981: 10-12; Wang Weifan 2013: 4)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1980, Ding Guangxun, in his opening speech at the Third National Conference of Christianity, mentioned: ‚ÄúOver the past few decades, our Chinese language has developed, and new discoveries of ancient biblical manuscripts have been made. To better express the original meaning in Chinese, the revision of the Chinese translation of the Bible also needs to be carried out. However, this is a serious sacred task that must be conducted with caution, and it is currently impossible to estimate when a new version can be published for believers to use; this will take several years.‚Äù Subsequently, in response to a reporter‚Äôs question, a spokesperson for the two Christian councils also stated: ‚ÄúFrom the perspective of the Chinese translation, there are areas in the current version that need improvement, and some scholars in our country‚Äôs Christianity are conducting research to seek a version more aligned with the original meaning, but this work will take several years to complete.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to Wang Weifan, this work had already begun in 1979, led by Bishop Wang Shenyin and Chen Zemin, and they decided to first retranslate the ‚ÄúGospel of Luke.‚Äù In 1981, Bishop Wang Shenyin published an article in ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù titled ‚ÄúSuggestions for the Revised Chinese Translation of the Bible,‚Äù indicating that the Jinling Union Theological Seminary had taken on this task and that the four gospels had already been revised. He mentioned that the principles of this revision included: (1) correcting misused vocabulary in the old versions, for example, in Luke 3:14 ‚ÄúWith money and grain, you should be content,‚Äù changing ‚Äúmoney‚Äù to ‚Äúgrains,‚Äù as the former refers to ‚Äúland taxes paid by farmers in the old society,‚Äù while the latter refers to ‚Äúrations and allowances given to soldiers by the old army‚Äù; (2) revising inappropriate or unclear wordings in the old translations, such as John 7:1 ‚ÄúJesus walked in Galilee‚Ä¶,‚Äù changing ‚Äúwalked‚Äù to ‚Äútraveled around,‚Äù as the former suggests crowds marching in the streets; and in Mark 11:10, ‚Äúthe highest and those who shout,‚Äù where ‚Äúthe highest‚Äù was replaced with ‚Äúthe most high‚Äù; (3) correcting mistranslations or omissions in the old translations, such as Matthew 18:12 ‚ÄúDoes he not leave the ninety-nine to go to the mountains and look for‚Ä¶,‚Äù changed to ‚ÄúDoes he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains to look for‚Ä¶?‚Äù</p>
<p>However, with the reopening of the Jinling Union Theological Seminary, most manpower had to be shifted to teaching preparations, causing the work of re-translating the Bible to be suspended.</p>

<li>Chinese Christian Delegation‚Äôs Overseas Visits 1981 (Feng Weiwen, Lin Ze 1981; Chu &amp; Lind 1983; Wickeri 2007: 279-280)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1981, there were two significant overseas visits by Chinese Christianity, marking the opening of the door for Chinese Christianity after the Cultural Revolution and the resumption of exchange with the universal church.</p>
<p>In March 1981, at the invitation of the Christian Conference of Asia and the Hong Kong Christian Council, a Chinese Christian delegation visited Hong Kong for three weeks. This was the first contact after nearly thirty years of interrupted communication between the churches in China and Hong Kong since the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, and it was also the first overseas visit of the Chinese church after the Cultural Revolution.Ding Guangxun, Bishop (Chairman of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, President of the China Christian Association, and President of the Nanjing Union Theological Seminary), led the Chinese Christian delegation, which consisted of 8 members: Shen Derong (Secretary-General of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee), Luo Guanzong (Vice Chairman of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, Chairman of the Shanghai Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and General Secretary of the Shanghai YMCA), Tang Matai (Vice President of the China Christian Association, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and Pastor of the Dongshan Church in Guangzhou), Cao Shengjie (Deputy Secretary-General of the China Christian Association), Han Wenzao (Deputy Secretary-General of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the China Christian Association), Cai Wenhao (Vice President of the China Christian Association, Chairman of the Zhejiang Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and Pastor of the Gulou Church in Hangzhou), and Xiong Zhenpei (Vice Chairman of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and Chairman of the Guangdong Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee). Among the 8 delegates, in addition to the main leaders of national patriotic Christian organizations, two representatives from Guangdong Province were especially arranged, likely considering the close relationship between the churches in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Additionally, members of the delegation represented historical denominations in Hong Kong, including Anglican, Baptist, Chinese Christian Church, and Methodist backgrounds.</p>
<p>On April 8, the delegation issued a ‚ÄúLetter to Brothers and Sisters in Hong Kong‚Äù to the Hong Kong church, emphasizing that the Chinese church had achieved self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation in the new China, and eliminated denominational prejudices within the church, fostering mutual respect in faith. During the Cultural Revolution, the gospel did not extinguish but rather thrived. Under the principles of the Three-Self, the Chinese church is not closed off and desires to engage in exchanges with overseas churches on an equal and friendly basis. They hope that overseas believers will respect the sovereignty of the Chinese church and the ‚ÄúThree-Self‚Äù principles and refrain from actions detrimental to the testimony of the Chinese church.</p>
<p>During their visit to Hong Kong, the delegation attended the ‚ÄúAsian Christian Witness Consultation‚Äù and delivered three speeches: ‚ÄúChinese Christianity: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow‚Äù (Cai Wenhao), ‚ÄúThe Witness of Chinese Christianity for the Gospel‚Äù (Cao Shengjie), and ‚ÄúExperiences and Insights of Chinese Christians Participating in National Political Life‚Äù (Han Wenzao).</p>
<p>After the meeting, the delegation held a discussion with the leaders of the council and conducted a joint thanksgiving worship service, with Tang Matai preaching about ‚Äúthe Jerusalem Conference before and after.‚Äù Attendees included leaders from various denominations and organizations in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In July 1981, the council published a compilation of the delegation‚Äôs visit to Hong Kong titled ‚ÄúThe Lord‚Äôs Love for Us.‚Äù</p>
<p>In October 1981, an international Christian conference themed ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Calling to a New Beginning‚Äù was held in Montreal, Canada, with nearly 150 representatives from around the world in attendance. Notably, representatives from Chinese Christianity and Catholicism participated, including Ding Guangxun, Han Wenzao, Jiang Wenhan, Shen Yifan, Jiang Peifan, Zhao Fusan, Chen Zemin, Fu Tieshan, Tu Shihua, Lu Weidu, and Wang Zicheng. The Chinese representatives spoke as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Zemin (Vice President of Jinling Union Theological Seminary) presented on ‚ÄúReconciliation with the People‚Äù; Shen Yifan from the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee spoke on ‚ÄúFreedom as Viewed by a Chinese Christian‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow New China Helps Christians Think Anew Theologically‚Äù; Jiang Peifan (President of the Jiangsu Christian Association) addressed ‚ÄúChurch Life at the Grassroots‚Äù; Jiang Wenhan (President of the China Christian Association) discussed ‚ÄúWhat New China Means to Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow ‚ÄòForeign‚Äô was the Chinese Church in China?‚Äù; Han Wenzao (Deputy Secretary-General of the China Christian Association) shared insights ‚ÄúOn International Relations of the Chinese Church‚Äù; and Ding Guangxun (K. H. Ding) made contributions as well.Ting, Chairman and President of the China Christian Two Conferences, presented ‚ÄúFourteen Points‚Äù and discussed ‚ÄúDifficulties and Prospects‚Äù; Zhao Fusan (Zhao Fusan, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) spoke on ‚ÄúColonialism and Missionary Movement‚Äù and ‚ÄúChurch Autonomy from a Theological Perspective.‚Äù On the Catholic side, Fu Tieshan (Bishop of the Beijing Diocese) presented ‚ÄúWitnessing to Christ by Chinese Catholic Clergy and Laity,‚Äù and stated, ‚ÄúThere is Freedom of Religious Belief in New China.‚Äù Lu Weidu (Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association) shared ‚ÄúReflections of a Chinese Catholic Layman‚Äù; Wang Zicheng (Diocese of Yueyang) discussed ‚ÄúFrom Blind Obedience to Independence‚Äù; and Tu Shihua (Bishop of the Hanyang Diocese) emphasized ‚ÄúTo Have an Independent, Self-ruled and Self-managed Church is Our Sacred Right.‚Äù</p>
<p>From the above speeches, it is evident that the representatives of the Chinese church aimed to convey the following messages to the universal church: (1) Clarifying the independence and autonomy of the Chinese church from historical and theological perspectives; (2) The significance of New China for the construction of Chinese theology; (3) The principles guiding the future foreign relations of the Chinese church.</p>
<p>The conference published ‚ÄúA New Beginning: An International Dialogue with the Chinese Church.‚Äù</p>

<li>Publication of ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China‚Äù 1981 (Xing Fuzeng 2019: 455-476)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first edition of ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China,‚Äù published in April 1981, was the first academic work on the history of Chinese Christianity published after the Cultural Revolution, attracting wide attention, even being reviewed and recommended by the People‚Äôs Daily on December 3, 1982. The author, Gu Changsheng, originally served as the secretary of the Seventh-day Adventist Three-Self Reform Organization. In late 1957, he moved to the History Research Institute of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, responsible for the project on ‚Äúthe history of imperialism‚Äôs utilization of Christianity to invade China.‚Äù He was transferred in late 1977 to teach at the History Department of East China Normal University. The manuscript underwent five revisions and passed five reviews before it was renamed from ‚ÄúThe History of Imperialism‚Äôs Utilization of Christianity to Invade China‚Äù to ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China‚Äù and published in 1981.</p>
<p>As the first academic work on the history of Christianity in China published after the Cultural Revolution, ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China‚Äù undoubtedly bears a profound imprint of its time. On one hand, although the extreme ‚Äúleft‚Äù ideologies of the Cultural Revolution were criticized, the ‚Äúleft‚Äù historical perspective remained deeply rooted. On the other hand, changing the title from a critique of ‚Äúimperialism‚Äù to a more neutral ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China‚Äù hinted at the arrival of a new era.</p>
<p>Gu Changsheng acknowledged the need to strike a balance between the ‚Äúlimitations of the era‚Äù and ‚Äúintellectual liberation,‚Äù but overall, his arguments were still constrained by the former. Therefore, at the time, some critiques in Hong Kong noted that ‚Äúthe entire book‚Äôs content reviews the activities of missionaries in modern China from a Marxist political perspective,‚Äù and it ‚Äúaims to highlight the role of imperialism in the utilization of missionaries to invade China, as well as how missionaries supported and implemented imperialism‚Äôs aggressive policies.‚Äù The book still presented the missionaries more negatively than positively, with little mention of their spiritual contributions. However, Gu pointed out that in mainland China, due to the prevailing extreme ‚Äúleft‚Äù ideologies, he faced considerable criticism for ‚Äúerecting a monument for the imperialist missionaries‚Äù and questioning ‚Äúhow missionaries could be associated with modern China.‚Äù Gu used the term ‚Äúattacked from both left and right‚Äù to describe the varying evaluations of the publication of his work.At the end of 1982, the People‚Äôs Daily published a book review by Song Jian, which affirmed that ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China‚Äù ‚Äústripped away the hypocritical facade of missionaries,‚Äù concluding that ‚Äúthe missionaries‚Äô activities were overall beneficial to the imperialist invasion of China‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe use of religion by imperialism to invade China is an important component of imperialistic activities.‚Äù On the other hand, Song raised the issue of the missionaries‚Äô motives, suggesting that they also ‚Äúspread advanced scientific and cultural knowledge‚Äù and ‚Äúbreathed new fresh air of science and even democratic politics‚Äù into China. He believed that the book ‚Äúused considerable effort to expose the crimes of imperialism in utilizing religion to invade China,‚Äù but felt that its treatment of the missionaries‚Äô introduction of Western scientific knowledge and the exchange of cultures was somewhat lacking in depth.</p>
<p>Since its first publication in 1981, ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China‚Äù has undergone several editions: a revised second printing in April 1983, a second edition in December 1991, a third edition in July 2004, and a fourth edition in April 2013. In the 1983 second printing, Gu Changsheng removed many references to ‚Äúcultural invasion.‚Äù At the same time, he acknowledged in the ‚ÄúPostscript to the Reprint‚Äù that he had ‚Äúinsufficiently explained the bridging role of some missionaries in communicating East-West culture and had not included those missionaries who had once supported China‚Äôs reform and revolution.‚Äù However, it was not until the 1991 edition that Gu had the opportunity to provide a more detailed discussion on the relationship between missionaries and the exchange of Chinese and Western cultures.</p>
<p>In 1984, Gu Changsheng was invited by the History Department of Yale University and traveled to the United States at the end of that year. During his visit, he was able to collect more materials at the Yale Divinity School Library. After returning to China in January 1987, Gu began working on the second edition of ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China.‚Äù In December 1988, at the invitation of the U.S. Congress, he attended the Presidential Prayer Breakfast on February 2, 1989, in Washington, D.C. Before his trip to the U.S., he submitted the manuscript for the second edition of ‚ÄúMissionaries and Modern China‚Äù to the publisher. After concluding his time in Washington, Gu visited several universities in the eastern U.S. (Princeton University, Rutgers University, Yale University, Harvard University) before heading to the West Coast, where he visited two campuses of the University of California. He was also invited by the World College West in San Francisco to serve as a visiting professor for one semester. At that time, Beijing was experiencing an unprecedented student movement, which was ultimately suppressed by official force. Due to the events of June 4, Gu participated in demonstrations in the U.S. condemning the Chinese government‚Äôs crackdown and ultimately decided to remain in the U.S.</p>

<li>The Fourth National Conference of Chinese Christianity 1986 (China Christian Two Conferences 1986: 1-4; Wang Weifan 1995: 31)</li>
</ol>
<p>From August 16 to 23, 1986, the Fourth National Conference of Chinese Christianity was held in Beijing, attended by 266 representatives from across the country. The conference issued a ‚ÄúLetter to Brothers and Sisters in the Lord Nationwide,‚Äù reviewing the achievements of the China Christian Two Conferences since the reform and opening: over 2 million Bibles published; more than 700,000 copies of ‚ÄúHymns (New Edition)‚Äù; published a total of 4 million copies of books including ‚ÄúTianfeng,‚Äù ‚ÄúJinling Theological Journal,‚Äù ‚ÄúSermon Collections,‚Äù ‚ÄúCorrespondence Course Materials,‚Äù and ‚ÄúVolunteer Training Lectures‚Äù; 10 theological colleges reopened; and various provinces and cities hosted different volunteer training and amateur theological classes. Regarding church openings, over 4,000 churches had opened in the past six years, along with tens of thousands of meeting points. In addition, 300 pastors were ordained, one-sixth of whom were female pastors. The Chinese church also resumed exchanges with churches from various regions. All of this resulted from the church being built on the truths aligned with the Three-Self principles. Finally, the conference asserted that ‚Äúthe church must establish itself in the holy love of Christ,‚Äù and emphasized the need for mutual tolerance and forgiveness borne out of love.</p>
<p>Notably, Ding Guangxun originally planned to preach at the opening worship service under the title ‚ÄúMay the Lord Strengthen the Work of Our Hands,‚Äù but it was later moved to the closing worship. Additionally, some colleagues opposed and attempted to block Ding‚Äôs remarks, as he proposed a shift away from past struggle-oriented thinking, advocating for the Three-Self to focus on managing the church well. Ultimately, Ding insisted and was able to share during the closing worship. Wang Weifan noted that Ding‚Äôs remarks ‚Äúaccounted for the ‚Äòleftist‚Äô line reflected in the church that emphasized ‚Äòclass struggle‚Äô and pointed out a path for the Chinese church ‚Äòto build itself in love.‚Äô‚Äù At the time, some colleagues disagreed, stating that ‚Äúthe past struggles were also a form of love.‚Äù(8) Reconstruction of Theological Education in China (Hoff 2009: 414-427; China Christian Two Conferences 1992: 171-173; Xing Fuzeng 2000: 20-23)</p>
<p>In February 1981, Jinling Union Theological Seminary was the first to resume classes, enrolling the first batch of theological students after the Cultural Revolution. Since Chinese theological colleges had been closed for over ten years, there was a significant turnout for applications, with nearly a thousand people signing up within one or two months. After selection from various churches, nearly 500 candidates remained, and ultimately 52 were admitted. At the end of 1980, Jinling began publishing ‚ÄúCorrespondence Course Materials,‚Äù which helped volunteers at rural meeting points and was very well received, with print numbers later increasing to over 40,000 copies per issue. In 1987, a one-year volunteer training class was established, enrolling about 60 people per class. By 1989, a Bible correspondence course was added, attracting as many as 15,200 applicants, with 1,000 ultimately admitted.</p>
<p>Following this, several new or reopened theological colleges emerged across the country, totaling 13 by 1989. The reconstruction of the theological education system that began in the 1980s was mainly divided into three levels: national, regional, and provincial, distributed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Level Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Level</strong> - Jinling Union Theological Seminary (Nanjing)</p>
<p><strong>Regional Level</strong> - Northeast Theological Seminary (Shenyang, Liaoning) - Sichuan Theological Seminary (Chengdu, Sichuan) - East China Theological Seminary (Shanghai) - Central South Theological Seminary (Wuhan, Hubei) - Yanjing Theological Seminary (Beijing)</p>
<p><strong>Provincial Level</strong> - Fujian Theological Seminary (Fuzhou) - Zhejiang Theological Seminary (Hangzhou) - Guangdong Union Theological Seminary (Guangzhou) - Anhui Theological Seminary (Hefei) - Shandong Theological Seminary (Jinan) - Shaanxi Bible School (Xi‚Äôan) - Yunnan Theological Seminary (Kunming)</p>

<p>When the Chinese theological education system was being rebuilt in the 1980s, the primary challenge encountered was a severe shortage of qualified teachers. Many of the remaining educators from the 1950s were few, and numerous older pastors (many without teaching experience in theology) were compelled to take on teaching roles, with the average age of teachers at that time being over 60-70 years. They were tasked with the arduous work of training successors. In the early 1990s, the State Administration for Religious Affairs conducted a survey on religious schools in China, which reported issues of ‚Äúinsufficient quantity and poor quality of religious teachers.‚Äù Among Christian theological colleges, a noticeable ‚Äúgap phenomenon‚Äù emerged, characterized by a predominance of elderly teachers and younger teachers, with a shortage of middle-aged core instructors. ‚ÄúAs time passed, the number of elderly teachers would decrease annually, and if not addressed, this contradiction would become even more pronounced.‚Äù Institutions mainly retained promising young graduates to alleviate teaching staff difficulties. By 1994, graduates from the 1980s already accounted for 54% of the professional course teachers in national colleges. Jinling Union Theological Seminary, as the only institution offering graduate studies, also had the highest proportion of graduates engaged in teaching at various theological colleges, effectively becoming a training center for faculty.</p>
<p>In 1987 and 1988, Jinling Union Theological Seminary sent 11 international students to the UK, the US, Canada, and Germany for further study, with 8 returning to contribute to teaching in various colleges.</p>
<p>In August 1985, the national Christian two conferences held a symposium on theological education at Mogan Mountain. Subsequently, the China Christian Association established a ‚ÄúTheological Education Committee‚Äù in February 1987 to specifically handle matters related to theological education. This committee developed a draft for a two-year theological diploma teaching plan and a four-year undergraduate teaching plan in August 1987.In March 1988, a teaching plan draft for the Theological Research Program and a one-year theological training class was also established. After collecting feedback and making modifications, the committee approved the plans at its second meeting in July 1988.</p>
<p>In 1987, the establishment of a ‚ÄúChinese Christian Theological Education Series‚Äù was confirmed, inviting colleagues from various schools to be responsible for the first batch of 15 course materials (later increased to 17). Publication began in 1989, and by 1992, a total of books such as ‚ÄúCommentary on First and Second Corinthians,‚Äù ‚ÄúPastoral Care and Work,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Brief History of Christianity,‚Äù ‚ÄúMeditations on the Song of Songs,‚Äù ‚ÄúIntroduction to the New Testament,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Brief History of the Hebrew Nation,‚Äù ‚ÄúBible Studies,‚Äù ‚ÄúBiblical Geography,‚Äù ‚ÄúIntroduction to Biblical Studies,‚Äù ‚ÄúOld Testament Studies,‚Äù ‚ÄúStudies on the Acts of the Apostles,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Life of Jesus‚Äù were published.</p>

<li>American Evangelist Billy Graham Visits China 1988 (Xing Fuzeng 2018)</li>
</ol>
<p>Billy Graham visited China in April 1988. He was accompanied by his wife Ruth McCue Bell, son Franklin Graham, and Pastor Tang Jinhui, who was responsible for translation. This visit was initiated by Bishop Ding Guangxun, the leader of the China Christian Two Conferences, in 1985 and was officially invited by the Chinese People‚Äôs Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the China Christian Association.</p>
<p>They arrived in Beijing on April 12 and, on April 14, engaged in discussions with Chinese religious scholars at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Peking University. On April 16, they were received by Premier Li Peng. On April 17 (Sunday), Graham preached at the historic Chongwenmen Church, originally a Methodist church, drawing a crowd of over a thousand people, with every seat filled. On the morning of April 20, he held discussions with Chinese religious leaders on peace issues.</p>
<p>After leaving Beijing, Graham visited his wife‚Äôs birthplace in Huaiyin, Jiangsu, where she left China at the age of 17. Ruth‚Äôs father, Lemuel Nelson Bell, was a medical missionary with the Southern Presbyterian Church and served as the director of the Renci Hospital in Huaiyin. After leaving Huaiyin, Graham and his group traveled to Nanjing, visiting Jinling Union Theological Seminary, Nanjing University, and the Aide Printing House, which was authorized by the government to print Bibles. At Jinling, he shared with future co-workers, encouraging them to preach centered on the authority of the Bible.</p>
<p>On April 22, they arrived in Shanghai. On the morning of April 23, Graham visited the famous house church leader Wang Mingdao. The Chinese government took a non-interfering and passive cooperation attitude towards Graham‚Äôs contact with the house church, regarding it as his private activity. On April 24, Graham preached in the morning at Mu‚Äôen Church (previously known as Methodist Moore Memorial Church) and in the evening at the Qingxin Church (formerly a Presbyterian church from the U.S.). During his stay in Shanghai, he also met with Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji.</p>
<p>Guangzhou was the last stop on Graham‚Äôs visit to China. On April 27, he specifically visited Lin Xiangao, a prominent leader of the house church in Dama Station, and gave a brief sharing during their meeting.</p>
<p>Graham‚Äôs contact with two notable house church figures was considered highly groundbreaking, as both Wang and Lin were symbolic figures associated with the anti-Three-Self sentiment, having been imprisoned on charges of counter-revolution in the 1950s and enjoying a prominent reputation overseas. For Graham, this trip had already received criticism from anti-Communist North American church figures, and failing to meet with the house church would have put him under even greater pressure.</p>
<p>Overall, Graham‚Äôs visit to China received positive evaluations. Some commentators indicated that the meeting between Li Peng and Graham reflected the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs tolerance toward religion. However, similar to his visits to the Soviet Union and Eastern European communist countries, which sparked criticism from North American churches, particularly fundamentalist factions, this visit did not escape the same scrutiny. Before leaving Beijing, Graham stated in an interview, ‚ÄúAnother reason I came to China is to help people build bridges of mutual understanding.‚Äù After completing his visit to China, he arrived in Hong Kong for more interviews, expressing optimism about the future of Chinese Christians. Undoubtedly, this visit significantly changed the impression of North American evangelical Christianity towards China. The two Christian associations also described Graham‚Äôs visit as an ‚Äúimportant breakthrough‚Äù in their overseas exchange work.</p>

<li>Issues Regarding Chinese Representatives at the Lausanne World Evangelical Conference 1989 (Tianfeng 1989a: 2-3)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Second International Congress on World Evangelization was scheduled to take place in July 1989 in Manila, Philippines. The organizing committee decided to invite representatives from the China Christian Two Conferences and house churches, with each group comprising 150 participants.The conference, citing ‚Äúinternal balance,‚Äù demanded that the Chinese government must approve all 300 participants to attend; otherwise, none would be invited. They sought assurances from the State Administration for Religious Affairs before submitting the list of 300 names to the Chinese government. Otherwise, it would imply that ‚Äúthere is no religious freedom in China,‚Äù bringing negative international repercussions. In February 1989, Ding Guangxun discussed this issue with some members of the organizing committee in the United States and offered suggestions; however, ultimately, ‚Äútheir fundamental attitude remained unchanged.‚Äù As a result, on May 18, the National Christian Two Conferences issued a statement condemning the organizing committee for reigniting factional conflicts within the Chinese church and creating divisions, stating that they ‚Äúdisrespect and even ignore the existence of our two conferences‚Ä¶ unilaterally creating a list of attendees from our country,‚Äù and ‚Äúdisregarding our country‚Äôs and church‚Äôs sovereignty, intervening in our internal affairs to such an extent, attempting to humiliate us with unreasonable demands.‚Äù The leadership of the two conferences expressed ‚Äúextreme indignation‚Äù regarding this situation. Nevertheless, the Chinese Christian spokesperson stated, ‚ÄúOur sincere relationship with the church leaders and broad participants involved in the Lausanne conference remains unchanged.‚Äù</p>

<li>The 1989 Democracy Movement and the Chinese Church (Qiao 1989: 8-11; Tianfeng 1989b: 29; Zhao Tian‚Äôen, Zhuang Wanfang 1997: 515-518; Lambert 1994: 211-219; Wickeri 2007: 288-295)</li>
</ol>
<p>In April 1989, the death of former CCP General Secretary Hu Yaobang spurred public mourning that led to a massive student and democratic movement, ending on June 4 with a violent crackdown by the Chinese Communist Party. During the 1989 democracy movement, voices supporting the students and democratic reforms emerged within the Three-Self Church and its leadership. For instance, on May 17, students from Jinling Union Theological Seminary held protests in the streets for several days, waving the seminary‚Äôs flag alongside various biblical slogans. On May 18, 15 students from East China Theological Seminary participated in the march, holding signs with messages such as ‚ÄúGod loves the world‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe love righteousness and hate unrighteousness.‚Äù On May 19, most students participated in support efforts, such as providing water to demonstrators. Students from Beijing Union Theological Seminary also joined the movement.</p>
<p>After martial law was declared in Beijing on May 19, on May 24, Ding Guangxun (Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference), Luo Guanzong, Li Shoubai, and Shen Derong (all members of the National Committee) sent a letter to the Chairman of the National People‚Äôs Congress, Wan Li, and the Chairman of the National Committee, Li Xiannian. On May 25, 15 standing committee members from the China Christian Two Conferences (including Luo Guanzong, Sun Yanli, Ren Zhongxiang, Shen Yifan, Yin Xiang, Qi Qingcai, Li Shoubai, Wang Juzhen, Deng Yuzhi, Wu Gaozi, Shen Derong, Cheng Buyun, Shen Cheng‚Äôen, Cao Shengjie, and Shi Ruzhang) sent a letter to Chairman Wan of the Standing Committee of the National People‚Äôs Congress expressing concern over the situation, particularly the ‚Äúanxieties‚Äù of Christian individuals. The statement affirmed the students‚Äô patriotic appeals and called for an urgent meeting of the National People‚Äôs Congress to be convened quickly to address the situation and restore stability and unity to the country.</p>
<p>After the June 4 massacre, Ding Guangxun and Han Wenzao issued a public statement in Nanjing, expressing shock at the events and stating that the leaders of the Chinese church felt their actions and words must be based on seeking the greatest benefit for the church under God‚Äôs guidance. They firmly believed in God‚Äôs justice and that the people would ultimately attain democracy, begging believers everywhere to pray for them to have strength and wisdom from God during these difficult times. However, as the situation evolved, the voices of reform quickly faded. On June 27, the National Christian Two Conferences also swiftly issued a statement supporting the decisions of the CCP‚Äôs 13th Central Committee‚Äôs Fourth Plenary Session to suppress the ‚Äúriots.‚Äù Local Three-Self organizations subsequently expressed political support for the ‚Äúsuppressing of violence‚Äù: on July 27, the Shanghai Christian Two Conferences passed a resolution firmly supporting all decisions of the Fourth Plenary Session. Other organizations, including those from Guizhou‚Äôs Liupanshui, Hunan‚Äôs Three-Self and Christian Association, and churches in various provinces including Hunan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Beijing, also indicated support for quelling the counter-revolutionary riots.</p>
<p>Zhao Fusan, a leader of the Christian Three-Self movement and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, did not return to China after publicly denouncing the Chinese government in Paris.</p>
<p>Regarding house churches, a reporter from Qiao visited the Dama Station Church in Guangzhou in June 1989, receiving a response that ‚Äúif we stray a little during this incident, the authorities will immediately ‚Äòhandle us.‚Äô‚Äù As a result, the church did not participate in protests, issue any statements, or take any action to support the students after May. However, Qiao‚Äôs report also pointed out that besides the external environment, the ‚Äúinternal beliefs‚Äù of house churches also played a crucial role.Many house churches believe that the church should not interfere in politics and must ‚Äúsubmit to the authorities.‚Äù Since the Bible states that all people are sinners, there will not be a ‚Äúperfect government‚Äù on earth. The position of the Dama Station Church can be seen as broadly representative of this view.</p>

<li>Original Denominations after Sectarianism 1982 (Zheng Jianye 1983: 11; Starr 2015: 2045-2057; Chan 2019: 86-91)</li>
</ol>
<p>The reconstruction of the Chinese church after the Cultural Revolution mainly referred to the Three-Self system established after the 1958 united worship, which excluded the possibility of restoring denominational organizations. According to the resolution of the expanded national meeting of the Two Associations of Christianity in September 1982, it was declared that ‚Äúthe Chinese church has entered a new period where denominations are basically concluded.‚Äù Subsequently, the Two Associations began to use the term ‚Äúpost-denominational‚Äù (not equivalent to ‚Äúnon-denominational‚Äù) to describe the state of the Chinese church. The so-called ‚Äúpost-denominational‚Äù refers to the church system transitioning between ‚Äúunited worship‚Äù and ‚Äúchurch union.‚Äù In fact, although the Chinese church abolished the denominational system after 1958, the denominational tradition still holds a certain sense of identity for many original denominational pastors and believers. Among these, original denominations with stronger tendencies towards ‚Äúrecoveryism‚Äù‚Äîthe little group churches (Christian gathering places, local churches), the True Jesus Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church‚Äîare particularly obvious.</p>
<p>At the expanded national meeting of the Two Associations in 1982, Bishop Zheng Jianye made seven suggestions regarding the issue of ‚Äúoriginal denominations‚Äù: (1) Each original denomination should not act independently under its own name; (2) Each original denomination should stop its own national and regional organizations; (3) Each original denomination should not independently engage in international connections; (4) Should not publish and distribute denominational publications independently; (5) All denominations should participate in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement; (6) All denominations should cooperate with other denominations participating in the Three-Self Movement, seeking consensus in faith while respecting differences; (7) All denominations should advocate for the independence and autonomy of the churches in our country, with believers loving their country and religion, serving to honor God and benefit others. The above seven points illustrate that the Chinese church has not fully realized the task of a ‚Äúunited church,‚Äù but is merely attempting to address the ‚Äúoriginal denominational‚Äù issue under a new system of ‚Äúchurch union‚Äù based on the foundation of united worship that signifies the basic end of denominationalism.</p>
<p>After the Three-Self organizations resumed operation, expanding unity and incorporating non-Three-Self faith groups into the Three-Self system became an urgent task at the time. One reason for the refusal of non-Three-Self faith groups to participate in Three-Self is that some original denominations insist on their denominational traditions and reject joining or withdraw from Three-Self due to doctrinal and liturgical issues.</p>
<p>In June 1983, the national Christian Two Associations held a special seminar in Nanjing, during which Ding Guangxun pointed out that in order to expand and consolidate the unity of the Chinese church, it was necessary to respect the liturgical issues of the original Seventh-day Adventist Church and original Christian gathering places. He said, ‚ÄúIn terms of faith characteristics, it is not about the minority obeying the majority, but the majority caring for the minority, being considerate of the minority.‚Äù For example, in January 1985, when the Shanghai Huai‚Äôen Church resumed its breaking of bread gatherings, it emphasized that this was ‚Äúto meet the special needs of brothers and sisters with this particular faith characteristic,‚Äù and not ‚Äúto restore the breaking of bread gathering of the original Christian gathering places,‚Äù nor ‚Äúto restore the organizational structure of the Christian gathering places.‚Äù At the national standing committee meeting of the Two Associations held in 1990, Ding Guangxun again pointed out that respecting the characteristics and traditions of individual denominations was necessary ‚Äúfor the unity of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.‚Äù He particularly remarked, ‚ÄúHolding worship on the Sabbath and conducting a humility ceremony before communion is not about restoring the Christian Seventh-day Adventist Church, nor is holding the breaking of bread gathering a restoration of the gathering places. These are all to be considerate of characteristics, uniting more people around the Three-Self and the ecumenical movement. We do this to avoid restoring these denominations.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1988, Ding Guangxun proposed to eliminate the term ‚Äúassociation‚Äù from the Chinese Christian Association, renaming it ‚ÄúChinese Christian Church.‚Äù Clearly, this was an important step from a ‚Äúpost-denominational‚Äù state toward realizing a united church system. However, this suggestion faced opposition from individuals within the Two Associations, particularly from original Baptists and original gathering places. Undoubtedly, building a united church in China faces significant resistance in practice.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that since the 1980s, the development of original gathering places, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the True Jesus Church has grown relatively quickly. In some areas, these original denominations have even become numerically the ‚Äúmainstream.‚Äù The centrifugal tendency of original denominations has increased with their expanding influence. The calls within original denominations to restore denominational identity have also become stronger, with some areas even seeing signs of denomination listing, threatening the ‚ÄúThree-Self Patriotic Movement.‚Äù ‚ÄúPost-denominationalism‚Äù is a unique pattern of Chinese Christianity. However, challenges from original denominations continue to exist.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Hymns of Praise: New Edition 1983 (Cao Shengjie 2022: 53-76; Cao 2022: 40-87)</li>
</ol>
<p>With the revival of churches in China after the Cultural Revolution, there was an urgent demand for hymnal collections used during worship.In 1981, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and the China Christian Association decided to compile a new collection of hymns and published a notice in Tianfeng, calling on Christians nationwide to compose hymns of praise. In the same year, the national Two Associations of Christianity established a hymn working group, later renamed the ‚ÄúHymn (New Edition) Editorial Department,‚Äù which consisted of four members: Cao Shengjie, Shi Qigui, Lin Shengben, and Hong Luming. Cao Shengjie served as the head in his capacity as Vice Secretary-General of the China Christian Association. Meanwhile, Shen Zigao, Yang Yinliou, and Ma Geshun were invited as consultants.</p>
<p>At that time, Bishops Ding Guangxun and Zheng Jianye set principles for the work, including ‚Äúmutual respect, inclusiveness‚Äù and ‚Äúsinicization of hymns,‚Äù and early on included hymns with characteristics from original denominations that were commonly used, for example, not only hymns from the six denominations of ‚ÄúUniversal Praise,‚Äù but also works by Jia Yuming and one hymn selected from the ‚ÄúSongs‚Äù compiled by the Christian gathering places. As for the latter, emphasis was placed on creations reflecting Chinese Christianity, embodying Chinese style. In terms of melodies, traditional tunes, adapted folk songs, and five-tone scales suitable for Chinese individuals were included. Regarding the text‚Äôs style, there was both classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and popular forms. Furthermore, to fit the circumstances of northern and rural churches, short poems centered on the Book of Psalms were also essential. The content also focused on self-sufficiency of the Chinese church and related hymns connected to the Three-Self Movement.</p>
<p>In 1982, a Hymn Committee was established to study and promote sacred music work within the Chinese church, and a ‚ÄúHymns of Praise: New Edition‚Äù editorial committee was formed, both chaired by Zheng Jianye. The new simplified score edition was published in 1983, with a preface written personally by Bishop Zheng Jianye.</p>
<p>It was printed in 1985 and contained 400 hymns, of which 102 were composed by Chinese individuals (56 being new collections from recent years); the rest were translations of foreign hymns, including ancient Latin, Greek hymns, and some hymns from Asian countries. Six of these hymns were introduced to the Chinese church for the first time, and some lyrics were revised. It also included 42 short songs and various simple guides.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>China Church Regulations Committee 1987 (China Christian Two Associations 1992: 44-51, 166-170)</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Christian tradition, church polity has a close relationship with the denominational system. However, with the cessation of denominational organizations, the original denominational polities also lost their function. How the Chinese church in the ‚Äúpost-denominational‚Äù period establishes a new set of regulations became an urgent issue.</p>
<p>Since 1984, more than 13 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) have developed their respective trial church regulations through their Christian Two Associations or associations. In August 1987, the joint meeting of the national Two Associations‚Äô standing committee passed a resolution on ‚Äúadvancing autonomy and establishing church regulations,‚Äù leading to the formation of the Regulations Committee, chaired by Pastor Cai Wenhao, responsible for promoting and assisting local Christian administrative bodies in formulating and perfecting church regulations while developing national exemplary church regulations for local churches to reference. After the committee was established, it held its first meeting in May 1988, proposing: (1) Church regulations must conform to the Bible and church tradition while combining the actual situation of the Chinese church to promote autonomy, but should not be formulated as binding documents; (2) Church regulations are the internal implementation rules of the church and must comply with the country‚Äôs constitution and legal provisions, but should not directly copy management regulations issued by the state, to avoid creating the mistaken impression of government interference in church internal affairs.</p>
<p>To formulate national church regulations, the committee referenced past original regulations of different denominations within Chinese churches and documents related to the World Council of Churches. In September 1989, it proposed the ‚ÄúProposed Church Regulations for Chinese Christianity,‚Äù primarily to draft certain items, collect opinions from various parties, and organize them into a ‚ÄúDraft Church Regulations for Reference and Implementation by Local Christian Churches.‚Äù</p>
<p>In May 1990, the committee held its second meeting to discuss the draft, subsequently drafting a second version, revised as the ‚ÄúDraft Church Regulations for Chinese Christianity (Draft for Consultation).‚Äù In August 1990, during the meeting of the national Two Associations, opinions were widely solicited. In April 1991, the committee made further revisions, producing the ‚ÄúRevised Proposal for Church Regulations for Chinese Christian Churches for Trial (for Consultation),‚Äù and held a third meeting in June to discuss. After the meeting, a second revision was written, ultimately correcting it to form the ‚ÄúFinal Draft of Trial Church Regulations for Chinese Christian Churches,‚Äù which was distributed for review by the standing committee of the national Two Associations. In December 1991, the standing committee officially passed the ‚ÄúTrial Church Regulations for Chinese Christian Churches.‚ÄùFrom the consultation draft to the revised draft, the name changed from ‚ÄúChina Christian Church‚Äù to ‚ÄúChinese Christian Churches,‚Äù as some committee members pointed out that there was no organization called ‚ÄúChina Christian Church‚Äù in China yet, hence the change to ‚Äúlocal churches.‚Äù This reflects the reality that, after sectarianism, the goal of a united church had not yet been achieved.</p>
<p>In the preface of the ‚ÄúTrial Regulations for Chinese Christian Churches,‚Äù it was noted that ‚Äúdue to the historical formation, denominational background, and development situations of local churches differing,‚Äù provincial and municipal church administrative bodies could formulate or revise their own regulations or implementation details based on this premise. It also indicated that ‚Äúindividual churches or gatherings, due to significant differences in church perspectives and traditions, could carry out church work according to original traditions, provided it does not violate the principles of Three-Self. If necessary, local church administrative bodies should provide services and coordination.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúTrial Regulations‚Äù were divided into six parts: Church, Believers, Sacraments, Clergy, Church (Venue) Organization and Management, in addition to the preface. Considering the nature of its regulations, the content leaned towards practical issues, such as definitions of believers, execution of sacraments, classifications of clergy, selection standards, and the principles of organization and management of church venues. Only in the ‚ÄúChurch‚Äù section was there a more general theological discussion; the rest addressed specific church issues, such as independence and the Three-Self principles. It emphasized ‚Äúmutual respect and acceptance regarding faith traditions and liturgies, not attacking each other, nor insisting on uniformity,‚Äù thus illustrating the coexistence and consensus among different traditions in the post-denominational period.</p>

<li>Shanghai Bishop Ordination 1988 (China and Church 1988: 32; Zhong Gao 1988: 5-6; Jinling Concord Theological Journal 1988: 6-7)</li>
</ol>
<p>On June 26, 1988, the Shanghai Christian Two Associations held an ordination service at the Mu‚Äôen Church, where Shen Yifan, 60, and Sun Yanli, 74, were ordained as bishops. The last time a bishop was ordained in the Chinese church was in 1955 when Bishop Ding Guangxun was ordained for the Jiangsu Diocese by the Anglican Church in Zhejiang, and Wang Shenyin for the Shandong Diocese. This marked the first ordination of a bishop in the Chinese church in 33 years and was notably significant as it took place in the ‚Äúpost-denominational‚Äù period without the tradition of a ‚Äúbishopric.‚Äù</p>
<p>In Christian tradition, bishops are the embodiment of ‚Äúepiscopal polity,‚Äù representing the highest spiritual and administrative authority within the church. The Anglican Church, Methodist Church, and Lutheran Church all adhere to an episcopal system. After the united worship in 1958, the denominational organizations ceased operation. After the Cultural Revolution, only the Three-Self organizations were restored, fully signaling the entry into the ‚Äúpost-denominational‚Äù phase. By 1988, only six bishops of the original Anglican denomination remained: Mao Kezhong (born 1904, age 84 at the time, ordained as bishop of Jiangsu in 1950), Xue Pingxi (born 1904, age 84, ordained as assistant bishop of Fujian in 1955), Zeng Yousan (born 1910, age 78, bishop of Henan), Ding Guangxun (born 1915, age 73, ordained as bishop of Zhejiang in 1955), Wang Shenyin (born 1915, age 73, ordained as bishop of Shandong in 1955), and Zheng Jianye (born 1919, age 69, ordained in 1952).</p>
<p>The decision of the China Christian Two Associations to ordain two bishops in Shanghai primarily reflected the spiritual significance of the bishopric and somewhat inherited or restored the ‚ÄúApostolic Succession,‚Äù but it did not signify a restoration of the ‚Äúepiscopal polity,‚Äù thus lacking the administrative authority or power associated with bishops under such a system.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúClergy‚Äù section of the ‚ÄúTrial Regulations for Chinese Christian Churches,‚Äù passed in 1991, also specifically addressed bishops (overseers), stating that ‚Äúin provinces, cities, and autonomous regions where conditions permit, bishops may be ordained if needed. Bishops carry greater pastoral responsibilities but do not hold special administrative powers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Before the ordination in Shanghai, Ding Guangxun had written to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, regarding this matter. In April 1988, Archbishop Runcie replied, indicating that this was an ‚Äúappropriate initiative taken by the Chinese church in your situation and a decision made at the right time.‚Äù He noted the characteristics of the Chinese bishopric‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of dioceses and administrative affairs‚Äù as ‚Äúa new aspect of the episcopal form.‚Äù He hoped that bishops would serve as a bond between the Chinese church and the universal church.Although the ordination of bishops in Shanghai was ‚Äúa new matter,‚Äù it also reflected continuity with church traditions in certain details. For instance, according to traditional custom, a new bishop should be consecrated by at least three bishops, while the consecration in Shanghai involved four bishops: Wang Shenyin, Ding Guangxun, Xue Pingxi, and Mao Kezhong, along with three pastors: Qi Qingcai, Wu Gaozi, and Yin Jizeng. Furthermore, both of the ordained individuals came from a background with episcopal traditions‚ÄîSun Yanli from the Methodist background and Shen Yifan from the Anglican background.</p>
<p>It is reported that following Shanghai, provinces such as Fujian, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi were contemplating the selection of bishops. However, the next public plan to ordain a bishop in the Chinese church would not materialize until 2004 (though this ultimately did not come to fruition). With the passing of the last bishop, Ding Guangxun, in 2012, there are no longer any bishops in mainland China.</p>

<li>Three-Self Theology (Ding Guangxun 1992: 1-4; Chen Zemin 1981; Shen Yifan 1988: 17-26; Ye Jinghua 1997)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the exploration of theological development during the 1980s, Jinling Concord Theological Seminary played a significant role. The revival of the Jinling Theological Journal in 1984 was marked by Chen Zemin‚Äôs remarks in the ‚ÄúReopening Statement,‚Äù indicating that the revival of the journal aimed to provide a space for theological education and research exchange amidst new circumstances for the Chinese church. The 1992 publication of ‚ÄúSelected Theological Articles from Jinling‚Äù compiled over 20 articles from the journal since its revival, which can be regarded as an organization of ‚Äúautobiographical‚Äù theology in China in the 1980s.</p>
<p>In the preface of the selection, Ding Guangxun pointed out the ‚Äúlimitations‚Äù of theological reflection in China, noting that many issues in the international theological community were not widely discussed in China. One significant reason was that the Chinese church, in order to maintain a broad ‚Äúunity,‚Äù needed to adhere to principles of mutual respect regarding faith issues and worship liturgy. ‚ÄúFor the sake of unity, theological thought and expression are somewhat constrained, leading to a situation where care for the status quo exceeds innovation.‚Äù Ding characterized this as ‚Äúthe price paid for unity,‚Äù referring to how the Chinese church, situated in a ‚Äúpost-denominational‚Äù scenario formed by united worship, was seeking to avoid theological disputes to maintain unity.</p>
<p>On another front, Ding also described the ‚Äúbroader environment‚Äù within which the Chinese church found itself: ‚ÄúFor over a hundred years, Christians in our country have remained a minority, surrounded by non-Christian ideologies and forces hostile to Christianity from all sides. The number of Protestants still accounts for less than one percent of the population. There are still those who self-identify as radical and oppose religion, occasionally raising their heads here, utilizing some new slogans to create public sentiment against religion.‚Äù He particularly emphasized that the Chinese church would not pursue a path of ‚Äúconfrontation and martyrdom,‚Äù but rather cherish the current opportunities and spaces to bear witness for Christ. In this situation, there developed a tendency to ‚Äúemphasize the salvific way of Christ as the unique message of the church.‚Äù In this regard, Chen Zemin pointed out that the task of theology is ‚Äúreconciliation,‚Äù a return to harmony‚Äîbringing Christians who had previously distanced themselves from the people back into identification and reconciliation with the broader populace. Only on this foundation could the gospel be witnessed to the people, thus allowing those distant from God to return to Him through the incarnational gospel and reconcile with the loving Father.</p>
<p>Shen Yifan, in ‚ÄúTheological Reflections of the Chinese Church,‚Äù asserted that the theological contemplation of the Chinese church was inseparable from the social circumstances in China. He elaborated on five aspects of the social realities faced by Chinese Christians: (1) the fundamental improvement of the fate of the Chinese people; (2) the eradication of social evils with systemic changes, and significant improvements in various social issues; (3) the noble character and selfless sacrifice of revolutionaries; (4) increased unity within Chinese society with shared goals for struggle; (5) the emergence of a new landscape in China after the Cultural Revolution. In this context, he believed that the theological thoughts of the Chinese church must address the following questions: (1) Is God‚Äôs love limited to those He has redeemed, or does it extend to all people? Does God perform His ‚Äúacts of love‚Äù solely through believers, or also through ‚Äúall political and virtuous individuals‚Äù? (2) Does corrupt human nature still reflect God‚Äôs image to varying extents? (3) Are all material advancements and achievements merely ‚Äúthe work of Satan,‚Äù or do they ‚Äúmanifest divine wisdom and care‚Äù? (4) Should people reject the real world or engage with it to promote material and cultural progress? Which aligns more with God‚Äôs will? (5) Do disasters and suffering push people towards God, or do they inspire efforts to escape disaster and suffering? (6) Is the world completely dominated by evil forces to the extent that its destruction is necessary for the kingdom of God to descend, or does God still reign over history and the world?(7) Is Christ‚Äôs redemption for individual reconciliation with God, or does it also include reconciliation of all human society with God? (8) Does the incarnation have meaning only for the individual soul‚Äôs salvation, or for the entirety of life and church life? (9) Are the relationships between faith and love, belief and actions, salvation and morality, humanity and God, and interpersonal relationships opposing or unified? The aforementioned theological reflections continue to tread along the discourse direction established by the theological mass movement in China during the 1950s and fully reflect the relationship between contemporary Chinese political circumstances and Three-Self theology.</p>
<p>However, by the late 1980s, alternative theological discourses began to emerge within the Three-Self framework. For example, some scholars cited Western theology to carve out a new linguistic space for established theology or reflected on China‚Äôs historical disasters (like the Cultural Revolution) from Christian views on humanity and God, indirectly criticizing the sinful issues within Chinese society. These alternative theological discourses were primarily seen in the Jinling Theological Journal.</p>

<li>The Issue of the Existence or Abolition of the Three-Self Organizations (Xing Fuzeng 1999: 82-99; Wickeri 2007: 262-271)</li>
</ol>
<p>In mid-February 1989, Bishop Ding Guangxun stated during an interview with News Network International in Los Angeles that the Three-Self Movement would disband by the end of 1991, with the China Christian Association replacing its functions. However, on April 12, the Edward Foundation released a statement in Hong Kong denying this claim. The question of the existence or abolition of the Three-Self organizations had actually been brewing within the movement for some time and sparked intense debate, reflecting the complexity and sensitivity of the issue itself.</p>
<p>Initially, in 1986, the China Christian Church convened its fourth national conference, where Ding Guangxun, in his closing speech (‚ÄúMay the Lord Strengthen the Work of Our Hands‚Äù), criticized ‚Äúthe backbone of the Three-Self‚Äù for clinging to ‚Äúold mentalities, old habits, and old attitudes‚Äù from the ‚Äústruggle era,‚Äù failing to ‚Äúbecome a church-building expert full of Christ‚Äôs love and grounded.‚Äù He then proposed that the ‚Äústruggle‚Äù of the 1950s and 1960s should give way to ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äù through ‚Äúchurchification‚Äù and ‚Äúpastoralization‚Äù to build the church, making the church acceptable to God, beloved by the people, and cherished by the believers. The Three-Self must be focused on ‚Äúestablishing a good church.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe must implement the Three-Self to establish a good church; use the building of the church to promote the Three-Self, to illustrate the correctness and necessity of the Three-Self.‚Äù If actions taken under the Three-Self banner harm rather than build the church, it is no surprise that there would be opposition to the Three-Self. ‚ÄúAs long as the Three-Self is dedicated to establishing a good church, believers will willingly accept it, and the Three-Self will become widely supported and justified.‚Äù Ding Guangxun called for serious attention to the relationship between the Three-Self and the church. He reiterated that the church is not a subordinate unit of the Three-Self patriotic organization; ‚Äúthe church is the body of Christ, the dwelling place of the resurrected Lord, and the fellowship of saints throughout the ages.‚Äù The church is the main entity, and both the Three-Self and the Association are products of specific historical conditions, serving as ‚Äúscaffolding‚Äù for the church. The conference officially proposed the slogan ‚ÄúBuilding the Church of New China According to the Principles of Three-Self.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1987, a joint meeting of the national Two Associations was held in Chengdu, themed ‚ÄúBuilding the Chinese Church According to the Principles of Three-Self Patriotism.‚Äù In his opening remarks (‚ÄúFurther Discussion on Establishing a Good Church‚Äù), Ding Guangxun proposed the principle of ‚Äúclarifying the relationship between the Three-Self and the church‚Äù: ‚ÄúWe have never done anything for the Three-Self‚Äôs sake. The Three-Self is a principle, a method, a pathway, with the goal of nurturing a church that is beloved by believers and ‚Äòfavored by the people‚Äô to thrive in China.‚Äù Clearly, Ding‚Äôs views faced some opposition during the meeting. In his speech, he explicitly noted that ‚Äúsome people still have reservations about building the church according to the principles of Three-Self patriotism.‚Äù Thus, he felt compelled to further clarify the political significance of ‚Äúbuilding a good church‚Äù‚Äîuniting believers. He emphasized, ‚ÄúIf the Three-Self does not elevate the banner of building a good church and does not regard establishing a good church as its duty, continuing to engage in practices that upset believers will politically align with opposing forces and centrifugal tendencies.‚Äù As long as the Three-Self can build good churches, the grassroots support for the Three-Self will be solid, and opposing forces will not be able to ‚Äútake our supporters away,‚Äù which will ‚Äúexpand the area of unity.‚Äù Therefore, the ‚Äúchurchification‚Äù of the Three-Self is the method for establishing a good church.</p>
<p>In 1988, Ding Guangxun spoke at the national joint meeting of the Two Associations held in Shanghai, entitled ‚ÄúClarifying the Relationship Between the Three-Self Organization and the Church,‚Äù pointing out how the Three-Self organization had, under the influence of political movements in the past, reluctantly intervened in the internal affairs of the church.He emphasized that the original intention of the Three-Self Movement was to oppose imperialism and promote patriotism, advocating for independence and self-reliance. However, following the outbreak of the Korean War and a series of political movements, the functions of the Three-Self organization ‚Äúunderwent changes,‚Äù transforming into a management department that leads the church. Therefore, Ding Guangxun stressed the need to adjust the functions of the Three-Self organization, which relates to the churchification of the Three-Self. He emphasized that any change in the functions of the Three-Self organization ‚Äúin no way means giving up the principles and guiding guidelines of the Three-Self.‚Äù Under the banner of the Three-Self principles, ‚Äúthe church and the Association should demonstrate the correctness and necessity of autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation through the effective governance of the church, its nurturing, and its preaching, which will yield better results.‚Äù</p>
<p>At the meeting, some attendees questioned whether ‚Äúnow is the time to clarify the relationship,‚Äù citing centrifugal tendencies within the church and the threat of overseas infiltration. Ding responded with a political interpretation: ‚ÄúIt is precisely because the situation is severe that clarifying relationships is even more necessary.‚Äù ‚ÄúDue to the lack of clarity in relationships, we have suffered considerable damage; expanding the area of unity often becomes an empty phrase.‚Äù</p>
<p>The question of whether to abolish the Three-Self organization became a highly controversial topic at the meeting. Some representatives suggested that ‚Äúthe Three-Self mission has been completed, and we can declare a victorious conclusion,‚Äù while others proposed that ‚Äúthe mission of the Three-Self can be integrated into the work of the Association.‚Äù There were also representatives who fervently defended the ‚ÄúThree-Self red flag.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ding Guangxun‚Äôs idea of abolishing the Three-Self was likely aligned with then-General Secretary of the Central Committee Zhao Ziyang‚Äôs political reforms emphasizing ‚Äúseparation of party and government.‚Äù However, the abolition of the Three-Self touched upon the vested interests within the organization, leading to strong resistance, especially from some ‚Äúold Three-Self‚Äù members in Shanghai and Guangdong, who resolutely defended the organization, thus facing significant obstacles to the idea of cancellation. After the Tiananmen Square incident, as Zhao Ziyang and the enlightened United Front Work Department lost power, the national meeting of the Two Associations held in Shanghai in 1988 was criticized as ‚Äúa gathering of an opposition party leading a campaign for bourgeois liberalization,‚Äù with the attacks directed specifically at Ding Guangxun. Despite being able to retain his leadership position in the China Christian Two Associations after ‚ÄúJune Fourth,‚Äù Ding no longer mentioned clarifying the relationship between the Three-Self and the church in the 1990s.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The Heresy Issue (Liang Jialin 1999: 168-174; Tang Shoulin, Ren Zhongxiang)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the 1980s, the first ‚Äúheresy‚Äù criticized by the China Christian Two Associations was the ‚ÄúShouting Sect.‚Äù However, the issue of the ‚ÄúShouting Sect‚Äù was simultaneously deemed by the Chinese government as ‚Äúa reactionary force disguised under the cloak of religion.‚Äù Thus, the ‚Äúheresy‚Äù in contemporary China often possessed a dual nature of political reaction and religious heresy.</p>
<p>The development of the ‚ÄúShouting Sect‚Äù in China was closely related to the teachings of Li Changshou from the local church. Originally a co-worker of the Christian gathering places, Li moved to Taiwan in 1949 and later migrated to the United States in 1962. He initiated the ‚ÄúShouting Movement‚Äù in 1967, claiming that the age of doctrine had passed and that the current era had shifted to the age of the Spirit, advocating for the release of the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord. The movement spread to China in the early 1980s and became known as the ‚ÄúShouting Sect.‚Äù The Shouting Sect‚Äôs opposition to the Three-Self Movement resulted in significant incidents impacting the Three-Self churches, drawing heightened attention from the government. The Religious Affairs Bureau characterized it as ‚Äúreactionaries exiled abroad by Li Changshou, who infiltrated and developed in conjunction with a part of the Christian ‚Äòlittle group‚Äô domestically,‚Äù stating they ‚Äúdisguise themselves under religious banners, deceive parts of the masses, disrupt social order, harm the country and the people, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities as a reactionary organization.‚Äù</p>
<p>While suppressing the ‚ÄúShouting Sect‚Äù nationwide, the China Christian community also began to critique Li Changshou and the ‚ÄúShouting Sect‚Äù theologically and doctrinally. Given that Li had worked with the Christian gathering places before 1949, co-workers from the original gathering places who participated in the Three-Self Movement, Ren Zhongxiang and Tang Shoulin, became key figures critiquing Li. In 1983, Ren and Tang wrote articles addressed to grassroots churches in the correspondence publication, describing Li Changshou‚Äôs teachings as ‚Äúheretical.‚Äù Later, the Shanghai Christian Affairs Committee published a co-authored book titled ‚ÄúContending Earnestly for the Faith (Refuting Li Changshou‚Äôs Heretical Teachings),‚Äù which not only argued the doctrinal points but also opposed the view that ‚Äúcritique can only occur from a spiritual faith perspective, not from a political one,‚Äù escalating the issue from a doctrinal ‚Äúheresy‚Äù to a political ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù or ‚Äúheretical teaching.‚Äù</p>
<p>From the historical perspective of the church, heresy originally concerned whether there were fundamental errors in doctrine; however, in the unique context of the contemporary Chinese church, political factors have been heavily intertwined, with the concept of ‚Äúheresy‚Äù often used interchangeably with ‚Äúheretical teaching.‚Äù(8) The ‚ÄúOnce Saved, Always Saved‚Äù Debate in Henan House Churches (Cheng Dapeng 2001: 125-126; Zhao Tian‚Äôen 2001: 161-163; Zhang Yinan 2010: 46-47)</p>
<p>In 1986, the three major house church leaders in Henan held a ‚ÄúFangcheng Conference,‚Äù which included Xu Yongze‚Äôs ‚ÄúRebirth Faction,‚Äù Shen Yiping and Shen Xianfeng‚Äôs ‚ÄúTanghe Team‚Äù (the predecessor of the Chinese Evangelical Fellowship), and Zhang Rongliang‚Äôs ‚ÄúFangcheng Church.‚Äù They invited spiritual elders from Henan, Wenzhou, and Shanghai to discuss two fundamental theological issues: (1) soteriology, specifically whether to accept the notion of ‚Äúonce saved, always saved‚Äù; and (2) pneumatology, whether speaking in tongues is necessary as evidence of being filled with the Holy Spirit. However, the meeting did not reach any conclusive agreements.</p>
<p>In 1987, the Fangcheng house church in Henan began a debate regarding the issue of ‚Äúonce saved, always saved.‚Äù Qiao Chunling emphasized that being chosen is predetermined by the Lord, and believers can still be saved even if they lose their faith. She quoted 2 Timothy 2:13: ‚ÄúIf we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself,‚Äù suggesting that even if some believers are ‚Äúunfaithful,‚Äù the Lord will still save them. Zhang Rongliang disagreed, arguing that the Lord saves all who believe; those who do not believe do not have eternal life. He questioned why people would need to believe if they could enter the kingdom of heaven without faith. Zhang pointed out that 2 Timothy should be read coherently within its context: ‚ÄúIf we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us.‚Äù Jesus is trustworthy and does not change due to people‚Äôs lack of faith, so believers must persist in their faith to remain eternally saved. Due to this doctrinal dispute, a division occurred within the church, and Zhang Rongliang led over ten believers who disagreed with ‚Äúonce saved, always saved‚Äù to reestablish their group.</p>
<p>The issue of ‚Äúonce saved‚Äù had already sparked controversy in the Wenzhou house church as early as the 1970s and continued to ferment within house churches. The theological debate also had its background in the Chinese church‚Äôs context, particularly concerning the issue of apostates under political pressure. Those opposing ‚Äúonce saved‚Äù firmly believed that ‚Äúthose who endure in faith will obtain eternal life, while those who forsake their faith cannot be saved.‚Äù Conversely, proponents of ‚Äúonce saved‚Äù maintained that ‚Äúreborn persons have eternal life, and if they can perish, how can that be considered eternal life?‚Äù However, dissenters used Judas as an example, asserting that Judas, who abandoned his faith, would inevitably face destruction.</p>
<p>During the debate, both sides labeled each other as ‚Äúonce saved faction‚Äù and ‚Äúmultiple salvation faction.‚Äù However, those opposing ‚Äúonce saved‚Äù denied the label of ‚Äúmultiple salvation‚Äù being placed upon them. They argued, ‚ÄúWe are justified through faith, saved through faith; rebirth occurs only once‚Ä¶ If a believer commits sin after coming to faith, as long as they do not abandon the Lord and repent, they are still saved. This is not rebirth. Even those who abandon the Lord, deny Him under pressure, yet repent and continue to trust in the Lord before death will also be saved.‚Äù They emphasized the responsibility of believers to maintain their faith and stated that the assurance of salvation should not lead to willful sinning.</p>

<li>L«ö D√†j√≠ (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Institute of World Religions 2012; Du√†n D√©zh√¨ 2011; Yang 2012: 49-54)</li>
</ol>
<p>L«ö D√†j√≠ (1931-2012), from D√†xi√†n, Sichuan. He began his studies at Southwest People‚Äôs Revolutionary University in 1949, subsequently working in the North Sichuan Administrative Office and the Southwest Military and Political Committee. After graduating from the Department of Philosophy at Peking University in 1957, he taught at Chongqing Geological School. In 1961, he joined the Department of Philosophy at Central University for Nationalities, and in 1975, he entered the Institute of World Religions at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (later renamed the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), participating in the establishment of the Marxist Religious Theory Research Office and serving as its director. In 1988, he became the honorary director of the Institute of Religious Studies at Central University for Nationalities and was also an advisor at Renmin University of China‚Äôs Buddhism and Religious Studies Research Office, as well as a member and advisor of the Chinese Religious Studies Association. In 2007, he was recognized as an outstanding social scientist in China. He passed away on June 28, 2012.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, there was a debate in China‚Äôs religious theory community about whether religion is the ‚Äúopium of the people.‚Äù L«ö D√†j√≠ and ZhƒÅng J√¨‚ÄôƒÅn (deputy director of the Marxist Religious Theory Research Office at the Institute of World Religions, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) advocated that the essence of religion is indeed ‚Äúthe opium of the people.‚Äù</p>
<p>L«ö D√†j√≠ published ‚ÄúConfirming the Scientific Guide to Understanding Religious Issues: A Rereading of Marx‚Äôs ‚ÄòCritique of Hegel‚Äôs Philosophy of Right: Introduction‚Äô‚Äù in the third issue of ‚ÄúWorld Religion Studies‚Äù in 1981. L«ö pointed out that ‚Äúcurrent religious research must continue to uphold Marxist theoretical guidance, specifically noting: Marx‚Äôs ‚ÄòCritique of Hegel‚Äôs Philosophy of Right: Introduction‚Äô lays the theoretical foundation of the Marxist view of religion, serving as a ‚Äòscientific guide to accurately understanding religious issues‚Äô; ‚ÄòMarx‚Äôs assertion that ‚ÄôCritique of religion is the premise of all other critiques‚Äô has universal significance; ‚ÄòA comprehensive understanding of Marx‚Äôs principle that ‚ÄôReligion is the opium of the people‚Äô is necessary as it remains the cornerstone of Marxism‚Äôs entire worldview on religious issues.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1982, L«ö D√†j√≠ published another article titled ‚ÄúA Preliminary Discussion on the Historical Role of Religion‚Äù in the fourth issue of ‚ÄúWorld Religion Studies.‚Äù The article primarily analyzed and argued for the role of religion in history based on Marxist theories regarding religious issues, combining facts from historical social movements related to religion in both China and the West. L«ö noted that the ‚Äútheory of the clothing of religion‚Äù is a basic concept of Marxist analysis of historical religious social movements, which has been strongly proved in various relevant contexts. He emphasized the distinction between ‚Äúthe correctness of the worldview‚Äù and ‚Äúthe right or wrong in politics,‚Äù pointing out, ‚ÄúEquating the correctness of the worldview with the political right or wrong is a concrete manifestation of metaphysical thought methods in religious studies, which must be denied.‚Äù He also criticized the notion of ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs own religion,‚Äù stating that such a thing not only did not exist historically but also did not exist in socialist societies. In conclusion, L«ö emphasized: ‚ÄúWe believe that the Marxist view of religion‚Äôs ‚Äòtheory of the clothing of religion‚Äô has been strongly validated in various situations; religion is the opium of the people, not the gospel of the people.‚Äù</p>
<p>He edited ‚ÄúIntroduction to Religious Studies‚Äù (1989) and authored works such as ‚ÄúHistory of Western Religious Thought‚Äù (1994) and ‚ÄúFrom Philosophy to Religious Studies: Selected Academic Papers of L«ö D√†j√≠‚Äù (2002).</p>

<li>ZhƒÅng J√¨‚ÄôƒÅn (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Institute of World Religions 2010; Du√†n D√©zh√¨ 2011)</li>
</ol>
<p>ZhƒÅng J√¨‚ÄôƒÅn (1930-2010) was born in Nantong, Jiangsu. In February 1949, he studied in the Russian department at Harbin Foreign Language Institute and in October entered the Department of Philosophy at Peking University. After graduation, he stayed at Peking University‚Äôs Department of Philosophy. In 1979, he was transferred to the Institute of World Religions at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and in 1982 became the deputy director of the Religious Studies Research Office there, achieving the rank of researcher in 1987.</p>
<p>In the second issue of ‚ÄúWorld Religion Studies‚Äù in 1981, ZhƒÅng J√¨‚ÄôƒÅn published ‚ÄúA Preliminary Understanding of the Statement ‚ÄòReligion is the Opium of the People‚Äô,‚Äù indicating that Marx‚Äôs statement made in 1844 in the ‚ÄúCritique of Hegel‚Äôs Philosophy of Right: Introduction‚Äù ‚Äúreveals the most fundamental attributes of religion and scientifically elucidates its essence and social function.‚Äù He quoted Lenin‚Äôs explicit point in ‚ÄúOn the Attitude of the Workers‚Äô Party Towards Religion‚Äù: ‚ÄúReligion is the opium that stupefies the people‚ÄîMarx‚Äôs famous saying is the cornerstone of Marxism‚Äôs entire worldview on religious issues,‚Äù implying that Marx‚Äôs ‚Äúfamous saying‚Äù serves as ‚Äúthe theoretical basis and core of Marxism regarding religious issues, our fundamental stance and guiding principle in studying religious issues.‚ÄùZhƒÅng pointed out that ‚Äúsome may believe that religion has not only been exploited by the reactionary ruling class but also by the rising bourgeoisie during its ascent and by peasant wars, making religion seem like a kind of neutral entity without class nature.‚Äù He considered this position ‚Äúinappropriate,‚Äù as it theoretically ‚Äúconfuses‚Äù the ‚Äúcontent‚Äù and ‚Äúform‚Äù of the issue. He cited Marx and Engels‚Äô term ‚Äúthe clothing of religion‚Äù used for ‚Äúthe religion utilized by the rising bourgeoisie and peasants‚Äù as clear evidence. At the end of the article, he reminded people to note that ‚ÄúMarxism-Leninism has also undergone a struggle between two lines on the issue of religion, opposing not only leftist tendencies but also rightist tendencies.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the fourth issue of ‚ÄúWorld Religion Studies‚Äù in 1982, ZhƒÅng J√¨‚ÄôƒÅn published an article titled ‚ÄúLearning Several Basic Theoretical Issues About Religion from Marx: Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of Marx‚Äôs Death,‚Äù proposing that historical materialism should serve as the scientific guide for studying religious issues. He emphasized that Marx‚Äôs ‚Äúbrilliant thought‚Äù ‚Äúis still our guiding ideology for revolution and construction, and also serves as our guide for scientific research,‚Äù and ‚Äúis a universal truth applicable everywhere.‚Äù Therefore, as researchers in Marxist religious studies, they should earnestly learn the basic theories of Marx regarding religion and learn to apply Marxist positions, viewpoints, and methods in specific research work. ZhƒÅng particularly stressed that ‚ÄúMarx‚Äôs assertion on the essence of religion is a truly scientific assertion,‚Äù pointing out that Marx‚Äôs famous statement ‚ÄúReligion is the opium of the people‚Äù summarizes the essence of religion and explains its social function. Thus, Marx‚Äôs assertion, along with his statement that ‚Äúreligion is an inverted worldview‚Äù and Engels‚Äô assertion that ‚Äúreligion is a fantastical reflection,‚Äù clearly reveals the essence of religion and provides an exact explanation of its nature. ZhƒÅng also indicated that when discussing the essence and fundamental characteristics of religion, it is necessary to emphasize that religion is not only ‚Äúan ideology‚Äù but also ‚Äúa superstructure.‚Äù Therefore, it is essential to uphold Marx‚Äôs assertion that ‚Äúreligion is the opium of the people,‚Äù meaning that religion, like opium, is a spiritual narcotic and ultimately ‚Äúa harmful thing‚Äù for the people.</p>

</ol>
<p>After the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party of China gradually restored religious activities throughout the country under the reform and opening-up policy. However, various religions did not disappear due to the full implementation of the ‚Äúeradication of religion‚Äù policy during the Cultural Revolution; instead, they developed even more vigorously than before, with the situation of Christianity being particularly notable. The number of Christians rose from 1 million in 1949 to 3 million as announced by the Chinese government in 1983, an increase of threefold. As a ‚Äúforeign religion,‚Äù Christianity, after undergoing the CCP‚Äôs ‚Äúreform,‚Äù ‚Äútransformation,‚Äù and ‚Äúweakening‚Äù in the 1950s, and the ‚Äúpromotion of decline‚Äù and ‚Äúelimination‚Äù policies in the 1960s and 70s, actually achieved significant growth over 30 years, which undoubtedly demonstrates that the CCP‚Äôs attempts to eradicate religion were a complete failure.</p>
<p>In March 1982, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued the document ‚ÄúBasic Views and Basic Policies on Religion During the Socialist Period of Our Country‚Äù (Document No.&nbsp;19), which clearly stated: ‚ÄúThe idea that religion will quickly disappear with the establishment of the socialist system and a certain degree of development of the economic and cultural landscape is unrealistic. The belief that one can completely eliminate religion through administrative orders or other coercive means is even more contrary to the essential views of Marxism on religious issues; it is completely wrong and very harmful.‚Äù So, how can the religion issue be fundamentally resolved? ‚ÄúIt can only be gradually eliminated on the premise of guaranteeing freedom of religious belief through the gradual development of socialist economy, culture, and technology, and through the gradual development of both material and spiritual civilization, which will eventually remove the social and cognitive roots that allow religion to exist.‚Äù However, such a ‚Äúgreat undertaking‚Äù cannot be achieved in the period of one, two, or three generations. It is evident that the spirit revealed in Document No.&nbsp;19 is still based on Marxist views of religion, asserting that only after the socialist cause is accomplished will the various reflections of real-world religions finally disappear.</p>
<p>However, the development of religion in China during the reform and opening-up period not only illustrates the fact that religion cannot be eradicated by hard political or administrative measures, but also entangles the Party-state in a paradox that is hard to reconcile. According to Marx‚Äôs theory of religion, with the arrival of a communist society, religion will gradually vanish. But in China, after 30 years of socialist practice, religion not only did not gradually shrink but instead experienced astonishing growth. In the 13th National Congress of the CCP in 1987, the theory of the ‚Äúprimary stage of socialism‚Äù was formally proposed, indicating that China‚Äôs socialist society is still in its primary stage, and future development must start from this reality, focusing on the planned commodity economy based on public ownership as the main task. Therefore, religion will continue to exist for a long time in the socialist society of China, which is still in the ‚Äúprimary stage.‚Äù This was a social reality that the CCP had to confront in the 1980s, leading it to adjust its theories and policies on religion. On one hand, it revised the assertion that religion is the opiate of the people, stating that it is not applicable to socialist China; on the other hand, it strengthened the management and control of religion.</p>

<li>Critique of Religious Idealism in Literary Works 1981-1982 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 1996: 268-280)</li>
</ol>
<p>In early 1981, after Li Ping published the novella ‚ÄúWhen the Evening Glow Disappears‚Äù in the first issue of ‚ÄúOctober,‚Äù it sparked great response due to the novel‚Äôs content that positively affirms religion, leading to a debate about its content. Many critics expressed dissent regarding the author‚Äôs inclination towards religious sentiment in the work, arguing that he could not maintain a historical materialist stance and had fallen into the trap of promoting religious belief.</p>
<p>In early 1982, ‚ÄúYouth Literature‚Äù held a symposium to further analyze and discuss this novella. At the meeting, He Xin, who adheres to Marxist literary theory, sharply criticized the problems present in the novel. He pointed out that the answers to the significant life issues revealed by Li Ping were quite superficial, and its tone expressed a sense of disillusionment, not only in political enthusiasm but also in values.</p>
<p>Due to the content of the novel involving the protagonist‚Äôs experiences and reflections during the Cultural Revolution, it was criticized for violating party policies. Ye Lu‚Äôs commentary remarked, ‚ÄúWhy does the author guide readers to participate in this ancient and profound philosophical debate? After experiencing a decade of chaos, do people need to re-find a theoretical and spiritual pillar to maintain stability and balance of the soul? Can Marxism not explain all of this, leading to a change of faith and other pursuits?‚Ä¶ The occurrence of a decade of turmoil does not mean the bankruptcy of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought. Similarly, just because the decade of chaos corrupted social ethos and caused moral degeneration for some, one should not seek support and rescue from Jehovah or Shakyamuni.‚Äù There were also critiques asserting that, during the post-Cultural Revolution period when young people experienced a vacuum of faith, the author took the opportunity to promote idealistic religious thoughts, which would only lead to broader ideological confusion and pose a threat to social unity and stability. Some even made combative criticisms: ‚ÄúThe ideological confusion among some comrades in our cultural field has reached a serious level. We cannot stand idly by regarding certain tendencies of religious idealism currently emerging in the realm of thought. Criticizing idealism and beliefism, and promoting dialectical and historical materialism, is an unavoidable task for us, especially for philosophical workers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the ‚Äúthree faith crisis‚Äù (loss of faith in communism, loss of faith in the Chinese Communist Party, and loss of faith in the modernization efforts led by the Party) that emerged in Chinese society post-Cultural Revolution reflects the confusion faced by Chinese youth in the early 1980s in pursuing life goals and direction. Therefore, religion became a means for some to pursue life‚Äôs values, with significant social roots. ‚ÄúWhen the Evening Glow Disappears‚Äù indeed aptly reflects the characteristics of this era, while its strong combat awareness criticism illustrates that Chinese society is in a state of transition between the old and the new, facing various rejections of new ideas before the old ideological consciousness has been eliminated.</p>

<li>Local Cadres‚Äô Interference in Church Affairs (‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì, Ë∂ôÂæ©‰∏â 1984: 5; ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì 1989: 18; ÁôæÂßì 1989: 19)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1984, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì and Ë∂ôÂæ©‰∏â expressed their views on religious policy, pointing out that there were still ‚Äúmany comrades who, regardless of what the constitution states, what the central government considers and instructs, or the complex relationships between religion, the masses, ethnicity, international issues, and many other problems, still firmly believe that religious freedom is secondary, and that the real intention of the Party and the country regarding religion is to limit, weaken, and compress religion, and thus they treat the faith issues of the masses rudely.‚Äù ‰∏Å noted that while proponents of ‚Äúeradicating religion‚Äù from the Cultural Revolution period have disappeared, many ‚Äúcomrades‚Äù are still influenced by that line, regarding belief as a very serious issue, and thus believing that ‚Äúlimiting religion is a matter of course, allowing only a few believers but not permitting an increase.‚Äù They regarded the religious affairs department as a ‚Äúdepartment that fights against religion, limiting and weakening religion,‚Äù taking it upon themselves to limit and weaken religion, resorting to administrative orders and ‚Äúsupplemented by various policies without legal basis‚Äù to deal with the religious community and believers.</p>
<p>At the National Two Sessions meeting in Chengdu in 1987, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì pointed out that among government officials, ‚Äúthere exists to some extent a situation that is not compatible or not fully compatible with the principle of self-supporting patriotism in running churches,‚Äù which undoubtedly posed a major obstacle to better managing the church and expanding the unity. The so-called incompatibility pertains to the ‚Äúleft‚Äù tendencies among local cadres, who often intervene in the internal affairs of churches in the name of strengthening management and administrative guidance.To this end, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì, who also served as a National People‚Äôs Congress representative, spoke at the National Congress in 1988, criticizing cadres for being ‚Äúnon-believers in religion, lacking understanding of religion, and indifferent to the thoughts and feelings of the believing masses.‚Äù He noted that they often harbored ‚Äúresentment towards religion, compressing religious activities, and promoting the demise of religion,‚Äù adopting a style that attempted to ‚Äúmanage every aspect of religion.‚Äù</p>
<p>How do local cadres ‚Äúmanage every aspect of religion‚Äù? This is primarily evident in personnel issues. In 1988, ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì reflected to the State Council‚Äôs Religious Affairs Bureau regarding the promulgation of the ‚ÄúAdministrative Regulations for Religious Activity Venues in Guangdong Province,‚Äù stating that many local cadres, regardless of whether regulations had been enacted, were already interfering with church personnel. For example, the stipulation that ‚Äúnon-religious professionals are not allowed to perform religious duties‚Äù violates the Christian tradition that values laypeople and volunteers. Furthermore, the promulgation of the ‚Äúthree determinations‚Äù (determining the scope, the location, and the personnel) required that clergy who preach in outside counties, cities, or provinces must obtain consent from the original local government‚Äôs religious affairs department. More seriously, the appointment of pastors and preachers must receive approval from the government‚Äôs religious affairs department, and the transfer of clergy must also be agreed upon by the government. Conversely, local cadres prefer to appoint certain ‚Äúactivists,‚Äù who are looked down upon by believers and have a notorious reputation, to ‚Äúissue orders in place of government officials.‚Äù The result was that ‚Äúmembers of the Communist Party were transferred from the religious affairs department into the church as atheistic church leaders,‚Äù leading ‰∏Å to lament, ‚ÄúIs this not a common occurrence?‚Äù</p>
