<li>Hsu Pao Chien (ÂæêÂØ∂Ë¨ô) (Âê≥Âà©Êòé 1981: 171-222; ÂæêÂØ∂Ë¨ô 1934: 44-50)</li>
</ol>
<p>Hsu Pao Chien (ÂæêÂØ∂Ë¨ô, 1892-1944), also known by his courtesy name Liuji, was from Dazhu County, Zhejiang. He grew up in a traditional Confucian family and moved to Shanghai in 1905 for his studies. His uncle advised him before his departure that he was not to: (1) join foreign religions; (2) join revolutionary parties; or (3) cut his hair and braid. While in Shanghai, he was deeply influenced by revolutionary ideas and read extensively about revolutionary literature. The following year, he transferred to Shaoxing Provincial School, remaining committed to the revolutionary cause. However, during his studies, he also engaged with Confucian thought and became aware of the scholarly interpretations from the Song and Ming dynasties. After graduating in 1910, he enrolled at the Beijing Taxation School, cutting off his braid as a sign of his support for the revolution. Following the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, he witnessed the political landscape shift from hope to disappointment, feeling frustrated. He began to believe that the hope for China lay in the revival of Confucian spirit and even participated in activities of the Confucian Association. However, after his direct involvement, he grew disillusioned with the ‚Äúpoliticization‚Äù of the Confucian Association.</p>
<p>In 1912, after participating in the Beijing Youth Association‚Äôs activities, he heard speakers discuss how Western strength was attributed to Christianity; this led him and his classmate Zhang Qinshi to privately study the Bible seriously starting in 1913, marking the beginning of his exploration of Christianity. In the spring of 1913, after being deeply moved by speeches from John R. Mott and Sherwood Eddy in Beijing, he decided to join a Bible study class. He later attended the summer session for students at Government Schools in North China, where he felt compelled to convert due to (1) the greatness of Jesus‚Äô character; (2) the sincere behavior of the believers he observed; and (3) the absence of true conflict between science and religion. He emphasized that one could embrace Christianity without discarding Confucianism, as the two could ‚Äúcoexist and complement each other.‚Äù Subsequently, he began attending worship at the London Mission in Beijing, where he asked Reverend Cheng Jingyi about baptism. He was baptized by Reverend Cheng after Christmas in 1913.</p>
<p>In 1914, Hsu Pao Chien became the president of the Youth Association at the Taxation School, actively engaging in service while also holding the position of president for the Social Progress Association. After graduating in 1915, he forsook a lucrative job at the customs to work as a student officer for the Beijing Youth Association. In response to the new ideas and the May Fourth Movement, he co-founded ‚ÄúLife Monthly‚Äù in Beijing in November 1919 with Hu Xuecheng and later established the ‚ÄúBeijing Preaching Society‚Äù in early 1920. At that time, Hsu wrote in The Chinese Recorder, describing their work as a ‚ÄúChristian Renaissance.‚Äù</p>
<p>In January 1921, he traveled to the United States and enrolled at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University, majoring in religious philosophy. Upon returning to China in 1924, he served as the executive secretary of the United Schools Association in Beijing while also teaching at Yenching University‚Äôs School of Religion. From 1926 onwards, he engaged in full-time teaching at Yenching University. In 1930, he received a year‚Äôs leave from Yenching University to serve at the World Student Christian Federation and the YMCA in Geneva. In 1931, he went to America again, continuing his studies and teaching at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University until he returned to Yenching University in 1932. In 1933, he earned his doctorate with a dissertation titled ‚ÄúEthical Realism in Neo-Confucian Thought.‚Äù</p>
<p>Additionally, in response to the Japanese invasion of China, he reflected on the issues of narrow nationalism, particularly during his studies in the U.S., where he interacted with Japanese students abroad, reconsidering that dismissing the entire concept of national identity was inappropriate. As he became involved in the work of the Pacifist and Love Society, he shifted toward promoting pacifism and internationalism. He argued that enlightened individuals from both China and Japan should strengthen cooperation and pushed for the ‚ÄúChina-Japan Christian Conference‚Äù to convene in Beijing in 1934.</p>
<p>While Hsu found fulfillment in his student work and teaching at Yenching University, he increasingly felt disconnected from the struggles of the common people. At the same time, he identified the contradiction between private property and the spirit of Jesus, leading him to contemplate abandoning everything to share in the hardships of the people and realize the ideals of a Christian society. Yet, due to family responsibilities, he felt sorrowful that he could not challenge the existing social system. In 1935, he decided to accept the position of Executive Director of the rural experimental area in Lichuan, Jiangxi Province, resigning from his position at Yenching University to immerse himself in rural development. In 1936, he published ‚ÄúExperiences in Rural Work.‚Äù After the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, he moved to the rear area in Chengdu and participated in the editing and compilation of the ‚ÄúCompendium of Christian Classics.‚Äù(1) Xu Pao-chien (ÂæêÂØ∂Ë¨ô) (Âê≥Âà©Êòé 1981: 171-222; ÂæêÂØ∂Ë¨ô 1934: 44-50)</p>

<li>Yu Dongchen (ÂëÇÂØ¶Âº∑ 1985a: 374-385)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yu Dongchen (1851-?), from Dazhu County in Sichuan, experienced poverty in his youth and made a living as a coal porter. From 1886 to 1890, Dazhu County experienced conflicts between local faiths and Christianity, during which churches were destroyed. In 1888, Yu and his brothers participated in these conflicts, ultimately taking a leadership role in the 1890 altercations, leading over 100 workers from coal kilns and paper mills to kill 12 Christian congregants in Longshui Town and destroy over 200 homes belonging to Christians. He issued a proclamation stating that ‚Äúthe foreigner possesses the nature of a dog or a sheep but wields the power of a tiger or a wolf‚Ä¶ the clergy infiltrate the government offices, distorting everything‚Ä¶‚Äù Soon after, French diplomatic pressure mounted on the Qing government, prompting General Qi Yuan and Governor Liu Bingzhang of Sichuan to dispatch troops to suppress the unrest. Yu retreated to the Western Hills, which became known as the ‚ÄúDazhu Church Incident.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1892, Yu descended again to attack Christians, prompting another military response from the government, which captured 37 of his followers. Yu fled once more. In 1898, after being arrested, he was taken to the Rongchang County prison. Soon after, members of Yu‚Äôs faction rebelled and stormed Rongchang County, coercing the magistrate to release him. After his release, Yu returned to Longshui Town and issued another declaration, stating, ‚ÄúThe destruction of churches in the sixteenth year of Guangxu (1890) was not merely my personal grudge but rather the public outcry of the people.‚Äù This incident prompted calls for swift action from foreign diplomats in Chongqing and church authorities. Given the intense anti-Christian sentiment in the region, officials feared that hasty arrests could incite greater resistance and thus resorted to hiring assassins to eliminate Yu secretly. Upon learning of this plot, Yu rallied his followers to the He Bao area in Rongchang County in May and led an attack that burned a Catholic church, killed two congregants, and abducted the local priest, M. Pere Fleury, along with another Chinese priest. Local officials intervened, but the latter managed to escape.</p>
<p>At this point, disparities emerged between General Gong Shou, who advocated for dialogue and negotiation, and Ren Xifen, who favored a dual approach of suppression and negotiation. Yu insisted on total amnesty for all anti-Christian cases and demanded that foreigners be prohibited from using such cases as leverage against local governance. However, the French minister and the bishop remained steadfast. Yu, feeling that the government was insincere, decided to take preemptive action, issuing a proclamation chronicling the plight of the people as well as the foreigners‚Äô arrogance, framing his uprising as a struggle for the nation and the people to eliminate harm. In August, Yu led over 2,000 followers intending to invade the city to burn churches and capture priests. Various congregants fled, and foreign nationals in Chongqing evacuated to boats in anticipation of a possible confrontation. In response to the escalating situation, the government resolved to conduct a thorough crackdown, ultimately resulting in Yu Dongchen being surrounded and captured by government forces, with all his followers surrendering.</p>
<p>Yu‚Äôs anti-Christian incidents spanned ten months, engaging over ten counties and resulting in the destruction of more than 20 churches, with casualties among missionaries and congregants. Following the incident, the Hankou consul requested compensation of 25,000 taels for missionaries and 400,000 taels for church repairs, ultimately settling for around 50,000 taels.</p>

<li>Zhou Han (ÂëÇÂØ¶Âº∑ 1985b: 553)</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhou Han (1843-1911), courtesy name Tiezhen, was from Ningxiang, Hunan. He enlisted in the military in 1860 after passing the provincial exam. Starting in 1882, he assisted the Imperial Commissioner Liu Jintang in military affairs in Xinjiang. In 1884, he returned to Hunan on leave and settled in Changsha. During this period, Liu Jintang, feeling that ‚Äúthe loss of public virtue has led to disasters,‚Äù planned to fund the printing of benevolent books in Hunan for reformation, and Zhou assisted in this initiative. However, due to difficulties in fundraising, it ceased around 1888.</p>
<p>While in Changsha, Zhou witnessed the increasing presence of foreign missionaries and began writing anti-missionary texts, which he published and disseminated. Between 1899 and 1901, he authored and published over a hundred anti-missionary works, mostly concentrated between 1890 and 1892. His writings circulated widely in Hunan, Hubei, and the Yangtze River basin, significantly raising anti-missionary awareness and inciting actions against missionary presence. Zhou‚Äôs anti-missionary literature was published under his own name as well as attributed to various historical figures including scholars and notable officials. The content of Zhou‚Äôs works predominantly critiqued Christianity from a Confucian traditionalist perspective, addressing the aggressive nature of missionary efforts and the cultural differences between Chinese and Western customs.(1) Conflicts between Wang Zai and Ni Tuosheng</p>
<p>The differences between Wang Zai and Ni Tuosheng (ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤) revolved around two main issues: (1) Wang advocated for an itinerant evangelism approach, serving as a free preacher in various locations, while Ni insisted on establishing ‚Äúlocal churches‚Äù; (2) regarding the ordination of pastors, Wang began to accept the necessity of ordaining pastors for the sake of evangelism, whereas Ni opposed this view. Ultimately, Ni Tuosheng left Fuzhou.</p>
<p>In 1927, Wang was invited to speak at the Guangzhou Spiritual Conference. In 1928, the conferences in Guangdong and Hong Kong began to co-host the Spiritual Conference, with Wang invited to lead on three separate occasions (1928, 1931, 1932). Through the Spiritual Conferences, he met R. A. Jaffray, a missionary from the Alliance Church, who invited him to participate in outreach efforts in Southeast Asia. In the winter of 1928, Wang traveled from Indochina to Singapore and Malaysia, then moving into the Indonesian archipelago, with East Borneo as the last stop. In 1929, Jaffray established the ‚ÄúSoutheast Asia Evangelical Mission,‚Äù with Wang serving as its president. In October 1929, Wang led revivals in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, and Beijing, calling for support among believers for the work in Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asia Evangelical Mission was later renamed the ‚ÄúChinese Overseas Mission.‚Äù</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Wang lived successively in Singapore and Indonesia. He immersed himself in evangelistic work in Southeast Asia, leading revivals and preaching meetings across various regions.</p>
<p>Wang Zai passed away in California, USA, on December 13, 1975, at the age of 77.</p>

<li>Ni Tuosheng (ÂÄ™ÊüùËÅ≤) (Êùé‰Ω≥Á¶è 2001; Âê≥ÁßÄËâØ 2004; Ê¢ÅÂÆ∂È∫ü 2003; ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2005)</li>
</ol>
<p>Ni Tuosheng (Watchman Nee, 1903-1972), originally named Shu Zu, was born into a Christian family in Fuzhou, Fujian. His grandfather, Ni Yucheng, was the first Chinese pastor sent by the American Board to Fujian, while his parents, Ni Wenxiu and Lin Heping, were dedicated Christians, with his mother having a background in the Methodist Church. In 1916, Ni entered Trinity College, administered by the Anglican Church in Fuzhou. Though he grew up in a Christian environment and was baptized as a child in the Methodist Church, he had not genuinely accepted the faith.</p>
<p>In February 1920, during a revival meeting held by E. H. M. Y√º in the Fuzhou Congregational Church, not only did Ni‚Äôs mother, Lin Heping, experience spiritual rebirth, but Ni also recommitted to his faith and devoted himself to the ministry. Ni received training from the missionary Margaret E. Barber and began to read works by Jessie Penn-Lewis. In March 1921, Ni and his mother were re-baptized.</p>
<p>In 1922, Ni and Wang Zai began to hold breaking of bread meetings in Fuzhou, contributing to a revival in the area. In 1924, the two split over church direction and ordination issues, and Ni departed Fuzhou. He then worked for about eight or nine months at the Ling Guang Newspaper in Nanjing before embarking on evangelism efforts in Southeast Asia and Japan. After returning to China in May 1925, he lived in Gulangyu, Xiamen, and established the ‚ÄúGospel Publishing House,‚Äù producing ‚ÄúChristian News.‚Äù In 1926, Ni preached in Xiamen but fell ill and went to Nanjing for recovery, during which he completed ‚ÄúThe Spiritual Man.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1927, Ni relocated to Shanghai, renaming the ‚ÄúGospel Publishing House‚Äù to ‚ÄúGospel Book Room,‚Äù where he published works such as ‚ÄúRevival,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Christian,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSermon Records.‚Äù By January 1928, he rented a space on Hading Road, Wenshu, to begin gatherings. In 1928, ‚ÄúThe Spiritual Man‚Äù was officially published by Gospel Book Room. At this time, meetings also began to emerge across various regions. Simultaneously, Ni connected with the British Brethren, and in 1931, they sent representatives to visit the meeting place in Shanghai. In 1933, Ni was invited to visit the British Brethren.</p>
<p>In October 1934, Ni married Zhang Pinhui, but faced public opposition from Zhang‚Äôs aunt, Zhang Meizhen. The incident affected Ni deeply, leading him to retreat for a year. In the autumn of 1935, he traveled to Yantai in Shandong, where he experienced a ‚Äúbaptism of the Holy Spirit‚Äù during a revival meeting, holding a special gathering in Yantai before returning to Shanghai and Quanzhou for more meetings, resulting in revitalization.</p>
<p>In 1938, he published ‚ÄúReconsiderations of Work,‚Äù further establishing his view on ‚Äúlocal churches.‚Äù In July, he set out to visit Britain, and in October, he visited Denmark. His speeches in Denmark were later compiled into ‚ÄúThe Normal Christian Life.‚Äù In July 1939, he returned to Shanghai to lead further meetings.</p>
<p>By the end of 1939, he took over his brother Ni Huaizu‚Äôs ‚ÄúChina Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory.‚Äù This involvement sparked dissatisfaction among his coworkers, who believed he had abandoned the church to engage in business. Even his coworker Li Yuanru urged the Shanghai church elders to halt Ni‚Äôs ministry. Faced with this internal pressure, Ni ultimately accepted a decision for his removal in May 1943, marking the second time in his ministry that he was forced to withdraw.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance against Japan, Ni participated in work focused on rural education and transformation efforts, further deepening his commitment to serving the Chinese people amid adversity.He firmly believed that the occurrence of anti-foreign incidents stemmed from the accumulated insults and injuries suffered by the populace, culminating in an outburst of outrage. The rumors regarding missionaries allegedly killing infants for their organs were merely the catalyst that ignited this volatile situation. Thus, he maintained that missionaries should reflect on their own actions and those of their congregants, considering how they provoked dissatisfaction among intellectuals and the general public.</p>

<li>Yu Dongchen (ÂëÇÂØ¶Âº∑ 1985a: 374-385)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yu Dongchen (1851-?), originally from Dazhu County in Sichuan, experienced poverty in his childhood and made a living as a coal porter. Between 1886 and 1890, Longshui Town in Dazhu County experienced conflicts between secular faiths and Christianity, leading to the destruction of churches. In 1888, Yu and his brothers participated in these conflicts and later took a leadership role in the disturbances of 1890, leading over 100 workers from coal kilns and paper mills to kill 12 Christian congregants in Longshui Town and destroy over 200 homes belonging to Christians. He issued a proclamation that stated, ‚ÄúThe foreigner possesses the nature of a dog or a sheep, but wields the power of a tiger or a wolf‚Ä¶ the clergy infiltrate the government offices, distorting everything‚Ä¶‚Äù Following this, French diplomatic pressure mounted on the Qing government, prompting General Qi Yuan and Governor Liu Bingzhang to dispatch troops to suppress the turmoil. Yu retreated to the Western Hills, this episode becoming known as the ‚ÄúDazhu Church Incident.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1892, Yu descended again to attack Christians, leading to another military response from the government, which captured 37 of his followers. After being arrested in 1898, he was taken to the prison in Rongchang County. Shortly thereafter, members of Yu‚Äôs faction revolted and stormed Rongchang County, coercing the magistrate into releasing him. After being freed, Yu returned to Longshui Town, issuing a proclamation that the destruction of churches in the sixteenth year of Guangxu (1890) was not merely his personal grudge but rather the public outcry of the people. The incident prompted calls for swift action from foreign diplomats and church authorities in Chongqing. Given the intense anti-Christian sentiment in the area, officials feared that rapid arrests could trigger greater resistance and resorted to employing assassins to eliminate Yu. Aware of this plot, Yu rallied his followers to the He Bao area in Rongchang County in May, where they burned a Catholic church, killed two congregants, and abducted the local priest, M. Pere Fleury, along with another Chinese priest. Local officials intervened, but the latter managed to escape.</p>
<p>At that point, disparities emerged between General Gong Shou, who advocated for negotiation and peaceful resolution, and Ren Xifen, who favored a dual strategy of suppression and negotiation. Yu insisted on total amnesty for all anti-Christian cases and that foreigners should not use such incidents as leverage against local governance. However, the French minister and bishop remained inflexible. Feeling that the government lacked sincerity, Yu decided to take preemptive action, issuing proclamations detailing the hardships faced by locals due to the foreigners‚Äô aggressiveness, framing his uprising as a movement for the nation and its people. In August, Yu led over 2,000 followers intending to invade the city to burn churches and capture priests. As congregants from various regions fled, foreign nationals in Chongqing evacuated to boats in anticipation of possible conflict. Due to the escalating situation, the local government resolved to conduct a thorough crackdown, ultimately resulting in Yu Dongchen being surrounded and captured by government forces, with all his followers surrendering.</p>
<p>Yu‚Äôs anti-Christian incidents lasted ten months, involving over ten counties and causing the destruction of more than 20 churches, with casualties among both missionaries and congregants. Following the conflict, the Hankou consul requested compensation of 25,000 taels for missionaries and 400,000 taels for church repairs, ultimately settling for approximately 50,000 taels.</p>

<li>Zhou Han (ÂëÇÂØ¶Âº∑ 1985b: 553)</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhou Han (1843-1911), courtesy name Tiezhen, was from Ningxiang, Hunan. He enlisted in the military in 1860 after passing the provincial exam. Starting in 1882, he assisted the Imperial Commissioner Liu Jintang in military affairs in Xinjiang. In 1884, he took a leave and returned to Hunan, settling in Changsha. At that time, Liu Jintang planned to raise funds to print benevolent books to influence society positively. Zhou assisted in this effort, but the fundraising difficulties led to its suspension around 1888.</p>
<p>During his time in Changsha, Zhou observed the growing number of foreign missionaries and began writing anti-missionary texts, which he published and disseminated. Between 1899 and 1901, he produced over a hundred anti-missionary works, concentrated mainly between 1890 and 1892. His writings circulated widely in regions like Hunan, Hubei, and the Yangtze River basin, significantly raising the awareness of anti-missionary sentiments and urging actions against missionary activities. Zhou‚Äôs anti-missionary literature was published both under his name and attributed to various prominent historical figures, such as scholars and notable officials. The content of Zhou‚Äôs works primarily critiqued Christianity from a Confucian perspective, discussing the aggressive nature of missionary endeavors and the cultural discrepancies between Chinese traditions and Western norms.From the Mass Education Movement, Y. C. James Yen gained insight into the lack of education among the humble peasantry, while recognizing that Chinese intellectuals often overlooked the ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù and ‚Äústrength‚Äù of their fellow countrymen. This propelled him to resolve that upon his return to China, he would dedicate himself to the movement for mass literacy.</p>
<p>After returning from France to the United States, Yen received a scholarship to Princeton University, where he enrolled in the graduate program in history in 1919 and earned his master‚Äôs degree the following year. Arriving in Shanghai in August 1920, he visited Yu Rizhang to express his desire to start a mass education movement, which Yu supported. Yen then joined the newly established mass education division of the National Association of the YMCA, responsible for compiling simple literacy readers, such as ‚ÄúThe Common People‚Äôs Primer‚Äù (Âπ≥Ê∞ëÂçÉÂ≠óË™≤). In 1922, he conducted his first literacy education experiment in Changsha, Hunan. Following this, during a second experiment in Yantai, Shandong, he expanded the education efforts to include women.</p>
<p>In August 1922, the Chinese National Association of Mass Education Movement was founded in Beijing, with the aim of ‚Äúeliminating illiteracy and creating new citizens.‚Äù Yen served as the executive director. He reflected on what he perceived as the two main issues facing China after the establishment of the Republic: the plight of the common people and the military. With rampant illiteracy, the quality of the populace remained low, making the establishment of a representative government nearly impossible. In this climate, the corrupt bureaucratic system persisted, and social and economic improvements were stalled, preventing the establishment of a robust public opinion‚Äîthis became the root of China‚Äôs internal and external troubles. Therefore, it was urgent to promote mass education, enlighten the populace, and cultivate a sense of democracy and national consciousness.</p>
<p>Given that over 85% of China‚Äôs population consisted of peasants, the focus of mass education needed to shift towards rural areas. In 1926, the Association began rural education experiments in Baoding, Hebei Province. In 1929, Yen and his family moved to Ding County, where the headquarters of the Association also relocated. The experimental area focused on four major educational methods: culture, livelihood, hygiene, and civic responsibility, aiming to enhance the literacy, productivity, health, and unity of the peasantry, thereby cultivating a new generation of ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù to fundamentally eradicate the four great vices of ‚Äúignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness.‚Äù They also published a weekly newspaper, ‚ÄúThe Farmer‚Äôs Gazette‚Äù (Ëæ≤Ê∞ëÂ†±).</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, the operations in Ding County were forced to cease due to the occupation. Yen subsequently moved the rural education movement to Hunan, where he continued his experiments in Xiangxi. In 1940, he founded the ‚ÄúChina Rural Reconstruction Institute‚Äù in Chongqing and served as its director. After the victory in 1945, this institute expanded to become the ‚ÄúRural Reconstruction College,‚Äù serving as the operational center for the Mass Education Movement.</p>
<p>Yen‚Äôs efforts in the mass education movement led to an interview by Pearl S. Buck, the content of which was compiled into the book ‚ÄúTell the People: Talks with James Yen about the Mass Education Movement,‚Äù published in 1945. Buck called for the spread of Yen‚Äôs mass education experiences in China to Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>
<p>In 1949, Yen left China, first going to Taiwan, then to the United States. In 1960, he founded the ‚ÄúInternational Institute of Rural Reconstruction‚Äù in the Philippines, continuing to promote his philosophy of mass education and assisting developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.</p>
<p>In May 1943, Yen was selected as one of the ‚ÄúTen Modern Revolutionaries‚Äù in the U.S.; in 1956, he was awarded the ‚ÄúRamon Magsaysay Award‚Äù in the Philippines; later, he received the ‚ÄúDwight D. Eisenhower Award‚Äù and the ‚ÄúPresidential End Hunger Awards‚Äù as lifetime achievement awards. He dedicated his life to rural reconstruction globally and earned the title of ‚ÄúFather of Mass Education in China.‚Äù</p>
<p>Yen passed away on January 17, 1990, in New York, due to pneumonia, at the age of 98.(1) The Anti-Missionary Sentiment of Gu Hongming (ËæúÈ¥ªÈäò) (ËæúÈ¥ªÈäò 1996: 41-51)</p>
<p>Gu Hongming (Ku Hung-ming, 1857-1928) was born in Xiamen, Fujian, and raised in the British colony of Penang (Malaysia). He lived and studied in Scotland and Germany, mastering multiple languages including English, German, and French. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh in 1877, Gu continued his studies at Leipzig University and the University of Paris. Upon returning to Penang in 1880, he dedicated himself to the study of Chinese culture. By 1885, he returned to China, assisting Governor Zhang Zhidong in modernization efforts. Despite promoting modernization, Gu was culturally conservative and an advocate for Confucianism, often acting as a cultural conservative with knowledge of both Eastern and Western traditions.</p>
<p>On July 21, 1891, Gu published an article in the North China Herald titled ‚ÄúDefensio Populi ad Populos or The Modern Missionaries Considered in Relation to the Recent Riots.‚Äù In it, he criticized the actions of missionaries in China while defending the anti-Christian incidents stirred by the Chinese populace. Gu expressed skepticism regarding the missionary goals emphasized by Western missionaries, categorizing them into three areas: (1) the moral upliftment of the people. He argued that if missionaries could genuinely prove their efforts achieved this goal, it would be reasonable for them to receive treaty protections. However, he posed the question: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it a public secret that only the worst, weakest, ignorant, and impoverished individuals among the Chinese have converted to Christianity? Aside from these, who else have missionaries successfully converted?‚Äù In Gu‚Äôs view, these converts had only adopted Christianity for financial advantages, thus abandoning their ancestral beliefs and becoming disenfranchised individuals following foreign dictates while disdaining their own historical traditions. He challenged missionaries to consider whether the spread of Christianity genuinely raised moral standards among the Chinese.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The Enlightenment of the People. Gu argued that if the work of missionaries truly enlightened the populace and brought light to dark places, they would naturally win the support of the Chinese. However, he questioned whether what missionaries brought was indeed ‚Äúscientific knowledge,‚Äù or merely ‚Äúsuperficial tricks‚Äù rather than genuine science. With his insights into modern Western thought and the circumstances of the medieval church, Gu criticized missionaries for fundamentally standing against scientific principles. The assertion that the Bible was dictated by an omniscient Creator was, in his perspective, thoroughly anti-scientific. ‚ÄúThose who burn and harm scientists in Europe are posing as champions of science and knowledge here in China; how strange and absurd is this!‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>Charity Work. Although missionaries invested considerable resources in charity work in China, Gu pointed out that such commendable endeavors must be justified in terms of expense. He claimed that if the funds spent by foreign governments to protect missionary activities were directly allocated to medical and relief efforts, it would undoubtedly yield greater benefits. Moreover, among the millions donated by Westerners, how much was genuinely used to ease the suffering of the Chinese people? How many were spent on supporting missionaries and their families, or on constructing beautiful homes and other administrative costs?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In Gu Hongming‚Äôs view, if the goal of missionaries was to uplift morals and enlighten the populace, then this seemed nothing more than deception and fantasy. Regarding charitable work, it was simply a large charity plan meant for the unemployed professionals (referring to missionaries). Thus, missionary efforts in China were fundamentally a failure, contradicting their lofty goals. Furthermore, with the support of Western powers through military might, missionaries operated with a group of Chinese ‚Äúabandoned people‚Äù (converts) on Chinese soil‚Äî‚Äúbesides their pure clerical duties, everything insults and harms,‚Äù he asserted. This reality was the root of the resentment felt by the Chinese people toward foreigners.</p>
<p>Gu Hongming‚Äôs criticisms of missionary work reflect key influences on the perceptions of Chinese intellectuals towards Christianity, primarily shaped by the behavior of missionaries and the Chinese congregants, whom he called ‚Äúabandoned people.‚Äù</p>

His writings circulated widely in Hunan, Hubei, and the Yangtze River basin, significantly heightening anti-missionary awareness and inciting actions against missionaries.

<p>Xu Pao-chien (Hsu Pao Chien, 1892-1944), courtesy name Liuji, was born in Dazhu County, Zhejiang. Growing up in a traditional Confucian family, he moved to Shanghai in 1905 for his studies. His uncle advised him before his departure not to (1) join foreign religions; (2) join revolutionary parties; or (3) cut his hair. While in Shanghai, he was significantly influenced by revolutionary ideas and read extensively about revolutionary literature. The following year, he transferred to Shaoxing Provincial School, remaining passionate about the revolutionary cause. However, during his studies, he also engaged with Confucian thought and became aware of the scholastic interpretations from the Song and Ming dynasties. After graduating in 1910, he enrolled at the Beijing Taxation School, where he cut off his braid as a sign of his support for the revolution. Following the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, he watched the political landscape shift from hope to disappointment, feeling frustrated. He believed that China‚Äôs hope lay in the revival of Confucian spirit and even participated in activities of the Confucian Association. However, he became disillusioned with the ‚Äúpoliticization‚Äù of the Confucian Association after personally engaging in it.</p>
<p>In 1912, after participating in activities organized by the Beijing Youth Association, he heard speakers discussing how the strength of the West derived from Christianity, which led him and his classmate Zhang Qinshi to started studying the Bible in private starting in 1913, marking the beginning of his exploration of Christianity. By spring of 1913, after being deeply moved by speeches by John R. Mott and Sherwood Eddy in Beijing, he decided to join a Bible study class. He later attended a summer session for students at Government Schools in North China, where he felt compelled to convert due to (1) the greatness of Jesus‚Äô character; (2) the sincere behavior of the believers he observed; and (3) the absence of any real conflict between science and religion. He emphasized that embracing Christianity did not require abandoning Confucianism, as both could ‚Äúcoexist and complement each other.‚Äù Subsequently, he began attending services at the London Mission in Beijing, where he inquired with Reverend Cheng Jingyi about baptism. After Christmas in 1913, he was baptized by Reverend Cheng.</p>
<p>In 1914, Xu became the president of the Youth Association at the Taxation School, engaging actively in service while also holding the position of president of the Social Progress Association. After graduating in 1915, he declined a lucrative customs position to work as a student officer for the Beijing Youth Association. In connection with the new ideas and the May Fourth Movement, he co-founded ‚ÄúLife Monthly‚Äù in Beijing in November 1919 with Hu Xuecheng, and established the ‚ÄúBeijing Preaching Society‚Äù in early 1920. At that time, Xu described their work in The Chinese Recorder as a ‚ÄúChristian Renaissance.‚Äù</p>
<p>In January 1921, he traveled to the United States to study at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University, majoring in religious philosophy. After returning to China in 1924, he served as the executive secretary of the United Schools Association in Beijing, while also teaching at the Yenching University School of Religion. From 1926 onward, he engaged in full-time teaching at Yenching University. In 1930, he received a year-long leave from Yenching to serve at the World Student Christian Federation and YMCA in Geneva. In 1931, he return to the U.S. to continue his studies and teaching at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University until returning to Yenching University in 1932. He earned his doctorate in 1933 with a dissertation titled ‚ÄúEthical Realism in Neo-Confucian Thought.‚Äù</p>
<p>In addition, in response to the Japanese invasion of China, Xu reflected on the issues surrounding narrow nationalism, particularly during his studies in the U.S. where he interacted with Japanese students, reconsidering whether it was appropriate to dismiss the entire notion of national identity. He became involved in the Pacifist and Love Society, promoting pacifism and internationalism. In 1934, he argued that enlightened individuals from both China and Japan should strengthen cooperation and advocated for the ‚ÄúChina-Japan Christian Conference‚Äù to be held in Beijing.</p>
<p>While Xu found fulfillment in his student work and teaching at Yenching University, he increasingly felt disconnected from the struggles of the common people. He recognized the contradiction between private property and the spirit of Jesus, leading him to contemplate abandoning everything to align himself with the hardships of the people and realize the ideals of a Christian society. However, due to familial responsibilities, he felt sorrowful that he could not challenge the existing social system. In 1935, he decided to accept the position of Executive Director of the rural experimental area in Lichuan, Jiangxi Province, resigning from his position at Yenching University to dedicate himself to rural development. In 1936, he published ‚ÄúExperiences in Rural Work.‚Äù After the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, he moved to the rear area in Chengdu and participated in the compilation and editing of ‚ÄúThe Collection of Christian Classics.‚Äù</p>

</ol>
<p>Wu Leichuan (Wu Chen-ch‚Äôun, 1870-1944), originally named Wu Zhenchun, was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He received traditional Confucian education, passing the xiucai examination in 1886 and later the provincial juren examination in 1893, earning the title of jinshi in 1898. After achieving this status, he joined the Hanlin Academy, but due to the timing of the Reform Movement and the Boxer Rebellion, he was unable to secure a government position. From 1905 to 1909, he served as the supervisor and gentry in the Zhejiang Higher School. In 1910, he became the principal of a secondary school in Hangzhou and served as a member of the advisory board. After the Wuchang Uprising, he was elected as the Director of Civil Affairs for the Hangzhou Military Government.</p>
<p>Wu Leichuan‚Äôs relationship with Christianity began after he was transferred to Beijing. He was dissatisfied with the social activities in the capital, which compelled him to reflect on the value and meaning of life. At this time, he discovered that two of his acquaintances in the intellectual community were Christians, which surprised him, prompting the thought, ‚ÄúHow could educated individuals also believe in Christianity?‚Äù As a result, he purchased a copy of the New Testament and, after reading it, found many teachings admirable, though he struggled to accept the miraculous claims. He then began attending church services and sensed that Christianity could aid in transforming Chinese society, leading him to convert. Beginning in 1914, he participated in the baptism preparation classes offered by the Anglican Church and was baptized on Christmas in 1915.</p>
<p>In modern Chinese Christian history, Wu Leichuan stands out as one of the few individuals with a jinshi status who converted. From 1922 onward, he began teaching Chinese at Yenching University. At that time, faced with the impact of new ideas and the May Fourth Movement, a group of committed individuals in the Christian intellectual community formed the Beijing Preaching Society (ÁîüÂëΩÁ§æ) as a response. Wu Leichuan served as the vice-chairman of ‚ÄúLife Monthly‚Äù starting in September 1922 and initiated the establishment of the Truth Society in April 1923 to publish ‚ÄúThe Truth Weekly.‚Äù ‚ÄúLife Monthly,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Truth Weekly,‚Äù and later merged publications such as ‚ÄúTruth and Life‚Äù became significant platforms for examining faith during that era.</p>
<p>Wu Leichuan, with a profound background in traditional Chinese studies, began accepting Christianity at the age of 45.</p>

<li>Gao Bolan (È´ò‰ºØËò≠) (Èô≥Êô∫Ë°° 2013: 89-90; Macinnis n.d.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Gao Bolan (Asher R. Kepler, 1879-1942) was born in Pennsylvania, USA. In 1894, he enrolled at Lafayette College and later transferred to Ursinus College. After graduating in 1898, he briefly continued his studies at Urisnus Theological Seminary, achieving a degree at Hartford Theological Seminary in 1901. Following the Boxer Rebellion News in 1900, he decided to go to China as a missionary and was accepted by the American Northern Presbyterian Church in December of that year. He arrived in Shanghai in September 1901, being one of the first missionaries to come to China after the Boxer Uprising.</p>
<p>Starting his work in Ningbo in 1901, he served as the organizing secretary of the National Chinese Young People‚Äôs Christian Conference. Throughout his time, Gao actively promoted church unity, not only among the Presbyterian Church in China but also among various denominations. In the midst of these efforts, he was appointed as the English secretary for the conference of the Chinese Christian General Assembly in 1922. In 1925, he was elected as the executive director of the National General Assembly of the Chinese Christian Church and simultaneously served as an organizational secretary for the Chinese Christian Case Project, responsible for connecting the church unity initiatives of 13 denominations and 16 societies. He also served as the deputy executive secretary of the Chinese Christian General Assembly, urging various Presbyterian societies to continue their financial support for Chinese churches.</p>
<p>In 1927, the Chinese Christian Church National General Assembly was established, and due to Gao‚Äôs long-standing involvement in promoting church unity, he was appointed as the general secretary. In 1929, he received an honorary Doctor of Theology degree from Ursinus Theological Seminary. In 1933, after Reverend Cheng Jingyi was appointed as the general secretary of the National General Assembly of the Chinese Christian Church, Gao assumed the position of executive secretary.</p>
<p>Moreover, he reflected on the concept of church unity and authored ‚ÄúOneness,‚Äù articulating the spirit of unity within the Chinese Christian Church, particularly proposing the principle that ‚Äúunity is not uniformity,‚Äù which became an important document for the church unification movement in China.</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, he conducted inspections in various regions and sought ways for the church to respond. During his travels, Gao observed that many wounded soldiers lacked medical care, leading him to recommend that the Chinese Christian Church National General Assembly initiate a wounded soldier service. This resulted in the establishment of the National Christian Council for Wounded Soldiers in Transit in 1937, with Gao serving as the director. In 1938, he represented the Christian Conference in Wuhan to organize relief efforts.</p>
<p>Gao Bolan passed away unexpectedly in Massachusetts in August 1942 at the age of 63.Warren (from the Hunan Methodist Church) and Shen Wenqing (from the Hankou Methodist Church), along with other Chinese and foreign pastors, began preaching in military camps in Changde, resulting in ongoing and large-scale evangelism efforts that led to a growing number of soldiers converting to Christianity. Under the encouragement of Feng Yuxiang and the efforts of the accompanying pastors, the number of baptized soldiers increased significantly. Statistics indicate that by 1924, the Feng army had over 30,000 personnel in Beijing (Nanyuan and Tongzhou), with fewer than one-third unbaptized, and an overwhelming majority of officers were Christians, such as Zhang Zhijiang, Li Mingzhong, Xue Dubi, Lu Zhonglin, Liu Yufen, Zhang Shusheng, and Shi Yousan.</p>
<p>Due to Feng Yuxiang‚Äôs influence in the military and political spheres, many Western missionaries expressed great excitement over the emergence of the ‚ÄúChristian General.‚Äù Between the 1920s and 1930s, at least seven biographies authored by missionaries or Chinese pastors concerning Feng Yuxiang and his relationship with Christianity were published: (1) Goforth, Jonathan. ‚ÄúA Chinese Christian Army.‚Äù Shanghai: The Association Press of China, 1921; (2) Patton, Cornelius H. ‚ÄúGeneral Feng F-hsiang.‚Äù Boston: The American Board, 1921; (3) Broomhall, Marshall. ‚ÄúMarshal Feng: A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus.‚Äù London: The Religious Tract Society, 1924. Fifth Edition; (4) Davis, George T. B. ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Christian Army: A Story of Marshal Feng &amp; His Soldier.‚Äù New York: The Christian Alliance Publishing Company, n.d. [1925?]; (5) Ch‚Äôeng, Marcus. ‚ÄúMarshal Feng: The Man &amp; His Work.‚Äù Shanghai: Kelly &amp; Walsh, Ltd., 1926; (6) John, Bly M. S. ‚ÄúGeneral Feng F-hsiang: At Work for Christ.‚Äù Minneapolis, W. M. F. Literature Committee N. L. C., A., 1935.</p>
<p>These biographies focused heavily on documenting Feng‚Äôs religious life and how he promoted religious education and evangelism within the military. Additionally, many articles and contemporary magazines reporting on Feng and his military‚Äôs religious activities often referred to him as the ‚ÄúChristian General.‚Äù In May 1924, during the quinquennial global conference of the Methodist Church held in the U.S., the North China Annual Conference of the Methodist Church recommended Liu Fang and Feng Yuxiang as representatives to attend. Due to his military obligations, Feng could not attend the conference, but he sent a couplet expressing his hopes: ‚ÄúThe Methodist Church comes east, achieving success over seventy-five years; China will be saved, expecting fruitful results for millions of years.‚Äù Liu Fang, given his close relationship with Feng, was invited to speak at the conference to introduce Feng‚Äôs religious life and dedication to education and industry.</p>
<p>Under the admiration of both Chinese and foreign believers, a wave of ‚ÄúFeng Yuxiang enthusiasm‚Äù emerged in the church community, yielding high praise for this ‚ÄúChristian General,‚Äù with some even labeling him as the ‚ÄúCromwell of China.‚Äù In January 1923, the China Weekly Review published a survey of ‚ÄúThe Twelve Greatest Living Chinese,‚Äù revealing that Feng Yuxiang garnered over 1,200 votes, placing him second, just behind Sun Yat-sen, who received over 1,300 votes.</p>
<p>Following the May 30 Incident in 1925, Feng Yuxiang became thoroughly disillusioned with the so-called Christian nation and the actions of certain Western missionaries, yet his faith in Christianity remained unshaken.(1) Feng Yuxiang (È¶ÆÁéâÁ••) (Boorman 1968a: 37-43; ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 1996: 168-328)</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang (Feng F-hsiang, 1882-1948), courtesy name Huanzhang, was from Chaoxian County, Anhui. He served successively as the commander of the 16th Mixed Brigade of the Beiyang Army and held positions as military governor in Shaanxi, Henan, and army inspector. After the ‚ÄúBeijing Coup‚Äù in 1924, he reorganized his troops into the National Army, becoming the commander-in-chief and leader of the First Army. He participated in the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang during the National Revolutionary Movement in 1926. After the Central Plain War, Feng briefly retired but actively advocated for resistance against Japan, organizing a national anti-Japanese alliance in 1933 in Chahar Province, where he served as commander-in-chief. In 1936, he became the vice-chairman of the National Military Committee of the Nanjing National Government. Due to his devout Christian faith, he earned the nickname ‚ÄúChristian General‚Äù and even became a cover figure for Time Magazine.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1913, Feng was baptized by Reverend Liu Fang at the Methodist Church in Beijing. His transition from opposition to conversion was quite a journey. During his early years in the military, he had caused disturbances at gospel meetings and was initially uninterested in Christian faith. However, during the Boxer Rebellion, he was deeply impressed by the self-sacrifice of a female missionary who protected other missionaries. In 1905, while receiving treatment for an illness in Beijing, he was touched by the faith of a British doctor. By 1912, after becoming acquainted with Reverend Liu Fang, he began to attend Sunday services regularly. In 1913, during a revival meeting held by John R. Mott in the church at Chongwenmen, Feng was particularly moved by Mott‚Äôs teachings about altruism, the importance of interactions with the lower classes, and Jesus‚Äôs great sacrifice on the cross. After the meeting, he signed up for Bible classes, committing to pray daily.</p>
<p>The transformative impact of Christianity on personal morality and its influence on society and the nation were crucial factors in Feng‚Äôs conversion. Subsequently, he incorporated Christian doctrines into the training methods for his troops (the 16th Mixed Brigade). His diaries reflect his spiritual journey during this period. Between 1918 and 1919, Feng invited Liu Fang, Jonathan Goforth, and G. G. Ren to join him in pursuing spiritual work.</p>

</ol>
<p>Xu Baoqian (Hsu Pao Chien, 1892-1944), also known as Liuji, was from Dazhu County, Zhejiang. Coming from a traditional Confucian family, he moved to Shanghai in 1905 for his studies. His uncle advised him before his departure not to (1) join foreign religions; (2) join revolutionary parties; or (3) cut his hair. During his time in Shanghai, he was significantly influenced by revolutionary ideas and read extensively about revolutionary literature. The following year, he transferred to Shaoxing Provincial School, where he remained passionate about revolutionary goals. However, he also engaged with Confucian thought, becoming aware of the philosophical teachings from the Song and Ming dynasties. After graduating in 1910, he enrolled at the Beijing Taxation School, where he cut off his braid as a sign of support for the revolution. After the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, he experienced a shift from hope to disappointment, feeling frustrated about the country‚Äôs direction. He started to believe that reviving the Confucian spirit was vital for China‚Äôs future, even attending activities of the Confucian Association, though he later became disillusioned with its politicization.</p>
<p>In 1912, he began engaging with the Beijing YMCA‚Äôs activities, discovering the impact of Western strength through Christianity. This led him, along with his classmate Zhang Qinshi, to privately explore Christianity by studying the Bible seriously starting in 1913. Influenced by speeches from John R. Mott and Sherwood Eddy, he decided to participate in Bible study classes. In 1913, he felt a compelling urge to commit to Christianity due to the greatness of Jesus‚Äô character, the sincerity of believers, and the absence of conflict between science and faith. Xu emphasized that one could embrace Christianity while still retaining Confucian values.</p>
<p>Following a period of divine calling, Xu began actively participating in church activities and eventually got baptized in 1913. Throughout his subsequent work and leadership roles, he became influential in promoting mass education and outreach initiatives in China. After the war, he played significant roles in various educational institutions, emphasizing the importance of social reform and moral uplift.</p>

His long-standing involvement in church unity efforts and his commitment to promoting Christian values and education were widely recognized.</p>
<p>During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he traveled extensively, evaluating how the church could respond to the situation. Witnessing the lack of medical care for injured soldiers, he proposed that the Chinese Christian Church National General Assembly launch a wounded soldier service, which led to creating the National Christian Council for Wounded Soldiers in Transit in 1937, where he served as the director. In 1938, he represented the Christian Conference in Wuhan to organize relief efforts.</p>

In 1947, he returned to China after his health improved, resuming his role at Huazhong University, which had settled in Dali, Yunnan, to avoid bombings.</p>
<p>In 1949, after the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Wei continued to engage with the church community, focusing on the integration of Christian faith within Chinese culture. Throughout his tenure, he actively participated in discussions about how Christianity could interact with and adapt to local customs and practices, emphasizing the importance of cultural relevance in spreading the Gospel.</p>
<p>Wei Zhuomin (ÈüãÂçìÊ∞ë) remained a prominent figure in the development of Christian education and church unity in China, balancing his beliefs with the complex political and social realities of the time. He authored various works addressing the synthesis of Western and Chinese cultures, striving for a Chinese church that reflected both tradition and modernity.</p>
<p>In later years, Wei faced challenges as the political landscape shifted with the rise of the Communist regime. Nevertheless, he endeavored to promote understanding and cooperation among various Christian denominations, advocating for the establishment of a unified Christian presence in the rapidly changing society.</p>
<p>Wei Zhuomin passed away in 1976 in the United States, leaving behind a legacy of dedication to education, faith, and cultural engagement in the context of Christianity in China. His contributions played a significant role in shaping the landscape of Chinese Christianity during a pivotal era in the nation‚Äôs history.Wei Zhuomin (ÈüãÂçìÊ∞ë), also known as Francis C. M. Wei (1888-1976), was born in Xiangshan County, Guangdong. After early exposure to traditional education, he pursued further studies, ultimately playing significant roles in the development of Christian education in China.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the United States in 1946, Wei served as a visiting professor for the Luce Visiting Professorship of World Christianity, delivering a comprehensive lecture titled ‚ÄúRooting the Christian Church in Chinese Soil.‚Äù He subsequently accepted an invitation from the Hewell Foundation to give multiple talks in Andover-Newton and Boston, focusing on the theme ‚ÄúThe Spirit of Chinese Culture.‚Äù These lectures were later collected and published in the United States in 1947.</p>
<p>After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, Huazhong University relocated back to Wuhan. Due to significant damage to the campus during the war, Wei devoted himself to restoration efforts. However, he continued to serve as president even after the political regime changed in 1949.</p>
<p>On September 23, 1950, under government instructions, 40 leaders of the Chinese Christian community, including Wei, issued the ‚ÄúThree-Self Reform Declaration.‚Äù In April 1951, the Three-Self Reform Committee was established, and Wei was one of the 25 committee members. In July 1951, the government took control of Huazhong University. Following the start of semester in September, the entire school began land reform studies, and the Ministry of Education mandated a six-month rural assignment. In 1952, the Communist government implemented institutional adjustments, merging Huazhong University with other schools to form Huazhong Normal University.

<p>Wang (Wu Leid) and his leadership led to the establishment of the Lutheran Church of China as a formal organization that consolidated various Lutheran missions operating in China.</p>
<p>Starting from the 19th century, different Lutheran denominations from Europe and America engaged in missionary work in China. In 1906, eight Lutheran missionaries under the leadership of J. A. O. Gotteberg from the Norwegian Missionary Society wrote to all existing Lutheran missionary institutions in China, proposing to hold a meeting of Lutheran missionaries during the 1907 centenary of Christianity‚Äôs arrival to discuss unity. In May 1907, the meeting included participation from ten Lutheran mission societies comprised of seven American and European missions working in Central China and three German missions operating in Southern China. Given that the three German missions had arrived in China earlier than the other seven and conducted their work primarily in the Cantonese dialect, the conference decided to begin collaborative efforts in Central China.</p>
<p>In August 1908, the Union Lutheran Conference held its inaugural meeting at Jigong Mountain in Henan, where specific collaborative plans were formulated, and the decision was made to establish a jointly run seminary by Lutheran missions. In March 1913, the Lutheran Theological Seminary, supported by the American Mennonite Lutheran Mission, the American Hauge Synod Mission, the Finnish Missionary Society, and the Norwegian Missionary Society, was founded in Laokou, Hubei. That September, the seminary began publishing ‚ÄúThe Lutheran Journal,‚Äù becoming the first printed publication of the Lutheran Church in China.</p>
<p>In 1915, the Union Committee organized a temporary Lutheran Church of China Council as a preparatory body for a national Lutheran church. During the 400th anniversary of the Reformation in 1917, the Union Committee held its second general assembly and completed the draft of the constitution.</p>
<p>On August 20, 1920, the Lutheran Church of China was officially established at Jigong Mountain in Henan, where the first General Assembly was held, and the constitution was adopted. The governance structure of the Lutheran Church of China consisted of four levels: the Church, General Assembly, Synod, and District (church-synod-district-parish). The five original mission societies that participated in the founding of the Lutheran Church of China became the five synods: the Central Henan Synod (American Augustana Synod Mission), the Hubei and Hunan Synod (United Lutheran Church, which merged into the Mennonite Lutheran Mission in 1917), the Central Hunan Synod (Norwegian Mission), the Western Hunan Synod (Finnish Mission), and the Northern Hunan Synod (Swedish Mission, Church of Sweden Mission). The first superintendent was Wu Leid, the president of the Lutheran Theological Seminary.(1) The Development of Missionary Societies and Church Unity</p>
<p>The Lutheran Church of China saw significant organizational developments throughout the 1920s, with key leaders actively promoting unity among various Lutheran missions. In the second General Assembly held in October 1923, the American Lutheran Free Church and the Breklum Mission from Germany joined the movement, resulting in the establishment of the East Henan Synod and the South Guangdong Synod. By the third General Assembly in 1926, additional synods were formed, including the Jiangxi Synod (Berlin Mission), the East Shandong Synod (United Lutheran Church in America), and the Kanto Synod (later renamed the Northeast Synod, Danish Lutheran Mission).</p>
<p>During the seventh General Assembly convened in 1946, the newly established Yubeishan Synod (Norwegian Lutheran Mission) and the Southern Shaanxi Synod (Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Free Church) were included. However, the eighth General Assembly scheduled for October 1949 could not be held due to political circumstances. The overseer in Hong Kong, Peng Funa, organized a special meeting on Mount Daofeng, where four new member churches were admitted: the Lutheran Brethren Mission, the Barmen Mission, the Basel Mission, and the Christian Mission to the Buddhists.</p>

<li>Bible Union of China, 1920 (Yao 2003: 55-100)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bible Union of China was established in August 1920 by a group of fundamentalist missionaries in China. Following a speech by the prominent North American fundamentalist William H. G. Thomas at the missionary retreat in Guling, around 20 missionaries convened a meeting and formed a national alliance‚Äîthe Bible Union of China‚Äîaccompanied by a draft declaration and statement. The statement emphasized that missionaries must ‚Äúearnestly contend‚Äù for the faith as clearly revealed in both the Old and New Testaments, adhering to the fundamental doctrines outlined in the Apostles‚Äô Creed. It reasserted the need for action to protect the church and theological institutions in light of the discrepancies arising from Western theological debates, especially as some began to question the truth and accept a partial social gospel.</p>
<p>The movement aimed to awaken the church, renew understanding of the Gospel‚Äôs power, and promote the dissemination and study of the Bible, along with providing materials and articles that uphold biblical fundamental truths. It encouraged national missionary societies and churches to accept only those who rightly handle the word of God as missionaries, remaining vigilant against attempts to influence students and church leaders with erroneous beliefs and activities. However, the statement underwent several revisions, adopting relatively milder language to gain broader support, with key figures in the revisions being J. W. Lowrie, president of the American Presbyterian Church, and D. E. Hoste, the head of the China Inland Mission. Lowrie later became the general secretary of the Union.</p>
<p>The Bible Union was headquartered in Shanghai and published ‚ÄúThe Bulletin of the Bible Union of China‚Äù in 1921, which was renamed ‚ÄúThe Bible for China‚Äù in 1924. The first national conference was held in Shanghai in May 1922, where a committee of 100, comprising the leadership structure and executive committee, was elected, with a significant proportion of members being from the Presbyterian and China Inland mission societies. Membership increased from over 400 in 1920 to more than 2,000 by the end of 1922, accounting for about 30% of all missionaries in China during the 1920s.(1) The Bible Union of China and the Emergence of Anti-Modernist Groups</p>
<p>Following the foundation of the Bible Union of China, several other countries established similar anti-modernist organizations, including the Bible League for India, Burma and Ceylon, the Bible Union of Victoria in Australia, the Japan Bible Union, and the Madras Bible League.</p>
<p>In response, liberal missionaries in China countered the efforts of the Bible Union, accusing it of instigating theological disputes, conducting heresy trials, and undermining church unity. Some conservative missionaries also disagreed with the aggressive stance of the union. Even within the union itself, there were radical and moderate factions.</p>
<p>Since the Bible Union was a loosely organized alliance without a robust national structure, its headquarters was staffed by volunteers or part-time personnel, leading to a gradual decline in influence beyond their publications, like ‚ÄúThe Bulletin.‚Äù By the late 1920s, there were even calls among members for dissolution. However, with the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the Bible Union ultimately could not sustain its operations.</p>

<li>The Peking Apologetic Group, 1920 (Âê≥ÂúãÂÆâ 2000: 33-46; ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2020: 350-353)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1920, a group of Chinese and foreign Christians in Beijing established the ‚ÄúPeking Truth-Witness Group‚Äù in response to the May Fourth New Culture Movement. Their founding declaration explicitly stated: ‚ÄúThe stirrings of the environment have awakened our consciences,‚Äù affirming the belief that the dissemination of Christianity ‚Äúmust align with contemporary scientific and philosophical concepts to eliminate various misunderstandings and doubts, and to substantiate the truth of Christianity.‚Äù</p>
<p>The group‚Äôs initiator, Xu Pao-chien, explained that Beijing was the birthplace of both the patriotic and New Culture movements, and that the influence of both movements extended nationwide. He acknowledged that Christianity faced ‚Äúattacks‚Äù from these movements, prompting a group of Beijing Christians to feel an urgent sense of responsibility to clarify misconceptions held by critics and to discuss the reform of the church, addressing the criticisms that it could not adapt to new ideas regarding content, organization, systems, and practices. They aimed to demonstrate how Christianity could resonate with the spirit of the times and serve as a pioneer for societal evolution.</p>
<p>One of the group‚Äôs projects was the editing of a monthly publication titled ‚ÄúThe Life: A Journal of Christian Thought and Practice,‚Äù which emphasized the importance of Christian thought and practice. The inaugural issue was published in June 1920, containing a declaration that stated: ‚ÄúNow is the time for a ‚Äòsocial‚Äô reform in China. The awareness among students and leaders in the education community is encouraging. Critically and responsibly addressing all issues according to ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô and ‚Äòprinciples‚Äô is commendable. As Christians, we have long aspired to reform the world and should seize this opportunity to promote the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô and ‚Äòpower‚Äô of Christianity as a guiding force in transforming China. Having gained this awareness, we feel a significant responsibility, thus coming together to publish this ‚Äòmonthly journal.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>The editorial team consisted of 23 members, with Liu Tingfang as the editor-in-chief and Hu Xuecheng as the publishing manager. The members of the Truth-Witness Group and ‚ÄúThe Life‚Äù overlapped significantly with the YMCA, the Chinese Continuation Committee, and Yenching University, reflecting the rising Christian intellectual community under the foundation of Sino-Western cooperation.</p>
<p>In September 1924, the group restructured and was renamed the ‚ÄúLife Society.‚Äù In April 1926, ‚ÄúThe Life‚Äù merged with the ‚ÄúTruth Weekly‚Äù from the Beijing Truth Society, rebranding as ‚ÄúTruth and Life,‚Äù which continued until it temporarily suspended publication in 1941 due to the Pacific War, resuming afterward. Despite several restructurings, the content remained centered around themes of Christianity and its relation to Chinese culture, social reconstruction, and transformation, establishing it as a representative ongoing publication within the early 20th-century Chinese Christian liberal camp. Its origins were indeed stimulated and baptized by the New Culture Movement of May Fourth.(1) National Christian Council of China, 1922 (ÂÖ®Á¥πÊ≠¶ 1922: 249-252; ÁéãÊàêÂãâ 2006: 116-120)</p>
<p>In May 1922, the National Christian Conference of China convened in Shanghai, during which representatives decided to establish the ‚ÄúNational Christian Council of China‚Äù to promote cooperation and unity among various churches. As a unifying organization, the Council specifically declared at its inception that ‚Äúall matters of doctrine and church governance are not within the purview of this organization.‚Äù Furthermore, it articulated a declaration of its commitment to the Christian faith: ‚ÄúWe believe and reaffirm our loyalty to God, the Almighty Father; to Jesus Christ, His Son, our Lord and Savior, who loved us and gave Himself for our sins; and to the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life; we also acknowledge our loyalty to the Holy Spirit as the supreme guide for our faith and actions; and we affirm our commitment to the core Christian beliefs held by our respective churches.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the Council‚Äôs charter, its responsibilities included: (1) fostering and promoting a spirit of communion and unity among Chinese Christian churches, as well as a connection to the worldwide Christian community; (2) researching and advancing self-supporting, self-governing, and self-propagating church principles, facilitating the establishment of a nationalized church in China; (3) promoting the evangelization of China; (4) aiding church leaders, regardless of denominational affiliation, in exchanging ideas; (5) nurturing leadership talents to address various needs; (6) preparing for national Christian events; (7) cultivating spiritual life in churches and a missionary spirit; (8) organizing church communication offices; (9) coordinating and unifying various organizations; (10) representing Chinese churches in communications with other national Christian organizations; (11) making statements on matters of significant relation to the Chinese church; (12) executing tasks delegated by the national conference; and (13) preparing for the next national Christian conference.</p>
<p>The Council operated on a denominational and organizational basis, electing representatives as members (100 total) according to the number of people in each denomination and organization, and then forming an executive committee not to exceed 21 members, a majority of whom should be Chinese. In May 1923, the Council held its first annual meeting, where Yu Rizhang, the general secretary of the National Association of the YMCA, was elected president. Subsequent thematic committees established by the Council included committees on evangelism and retreats, rural churches and peasant life, industrial work, family affairs, anti-drug campaigns, indigenous churches, and international goodwill.</p>

<p>Since the late Qing period, the development of higher education among various Christian mission societies in China had progressed rapidly. In 1919, the presidents of Christian universities formed the ‚ÄúAssociation of Christian Colleges and Universities‚Äù to discuss common issues faced by these institutions.

<p>Since the late Qing period, Christian mission societies rapidly developed higher education in China. In 1919, the presidents of Christian universities formed the ‚ÄúAssociation of Christian Colleges and Universities‚Äù to address shared concerns. Between 1921 and 1922, the Committee of Reference and Council of the Foreign Missions Conference of North America organized the China Educational Commission to thoroughly investigate and review the current state of education in China, recommending strengthened cooperation among Christian higher education institutions and the formation of a united board to serve shared interests.</p>
<p>In October 1922, Nanking University, Yenching University, Qilu University, and Fujian Union University established the ‚ÄúGeneral Office of Chinese Union Universities‚Äù in New York. West China Union University and Yenching Female College joined in the late 1920s. This center became the first significant outcome of the collaborative movement among Chinese Christian universities.</p>
<p>In 1925, the Permanent Committee for the Coordination and Promotion of Christian Higher Education in China was established in Shanghai, responsible for united fundraising and comprehensive planning. Members included institutions such as Lingnan University, Fujian Union University, Nanking Women‚Äôs University, Zhejiang University, South China Women‚Äôs College, Nanking University, Yenching University, Qilu University, and Yenching Female College.</p>
<p>In 1928 and 1930, the educational committee of the China Christian Educational Association proposed a comprehensive plan for higher education in Christian institutions, providing recommendations for curricula and systems that were submitted for discussion among universities and their sponsoring missions. In 1931, 13 university committees and related missions approved the plan. However, due to the impact of the economic depression following 1929, which affected fundraising progress, the ‚ÄúComprehensive Plan‚Äù was inevitably abandoned, with only a university in the Huazhong region being established.</p>
<p>By October 1946, the United Board for Christian Higher Education in China was formally established, and the earlier office for Chinese Union Universities was reorganized as the new board‚Äôs executive office. The goals included enhancing cooperation and coordination among Christian universities to achieve their shared aspirations, while navigating the changing dynamics brought on by external and internal pressures.</p>
<p>The establishment and activities of the United Board represented a significant advancement in the collaborative effort within Chinese Christian higher education, aiming to sustain and expand its influence despite the challenges faced in the political and social landscape of China.(1) The Establishment of the ‚ÄúUnited Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia,‚Äù 1955</p>
<p>In May 1955, the organization earlier known as the United Board for Christian Higher Education in China was renamed the ‚ÄúUnited Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia.‚Äù This change came as the political climate in China dramatically shifted, prompting the board to refocus its mission and adapt to a broader regional context.</p>

<li>The Truth Society, 1922 (Âê≥ÂúãÂÆâ 2000: 58-66)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Truth Society was founded in the winter of 1922 by Liu Tingfang and Hu Xuecheng, who aimed to gather like-minded individuals to form a small group for spiritual reflection and discussions concerning church matters. Hu later solidified this idea by inviting six others‚ÄîWu Leichuan, Bao Guanglin, Zhang Qinshi, Peng Jinchang, Wu Yaozong, and Chen Guoliang‚Äîto form a small committee in December 1922. They held weekly meetings to study church and national issues. After discussions, they decided to launch a publication and in April 1923, began printing ‚ÄúThe Truth Weekly‚Äù in Beijing, officially naming their group the Truth Society. In the publication‚Äôs inaugural address, they clearly stated that as Christians, having received the mission to build the Kingdom of God and the aspiration to reform society, they needed to issue warnings against the corrupt political situation and awaken their compatriots to ‚Äúcome together to build the nation we envision.‚Äù Starting in September 1923, each issue of ‚ÄúThe Truth Weekly‚Äù featured the slogan: ‚ÄúUnited believers, in the fearless spirit of Jesus, testify to the truth, strive for church reform, and promote the transformation of China.‚Äù</p>
<p>Active participants in the Truth Society and contributors to ‚ÄúThe Truth Weekly‚Äù included: Wu Leichuan, Bao Guanglin, Zhang Qinshi, Peng Jinchang, Wu Yaozong, Chen Guoliang, Hu Guocheng, Li Rongfang, Liu Tingfang, Xu Paoqian, and Jian Youwen. However, the church community generally viewed the Truth Society‚Äôs opinions as extreme, even labeling them as ‚Äúheterodox.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1926, Wu Leichuan noted that since ten of the eleven members of the Truth Society were also members of the Life Society, with five serving as editors for ‚ÄúLife Monthly.‚Äù In April 1926, ‚ÄúThe Truth Weekly‚Äù merged with ‚ÄúLife Monthly‚Äù from the Beijing Life Society, becoming ‚ÄúTruth and Life,‚Äù until its temporary suspension in 1941 due to the Pacific War, after which it resumed publication.</p>

<li>The Chinese Fellowship of Reconciliation, 1922 (ÂßöË•ø‰ºä 2008: 20-23)</li>
</ol>
<p>Established in 1922, the Chinese Fellowship of Reconciliation was a branch of the international Christian anti-war organization, the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), in China. The founder, H. T. Hodgkin, had been sent by the British Quakers to work in education and medical missions in Sichuan from 1905 to 1910. Upon returning home, he maintained his commitment to advocating for peace, founding the Fellowship of Reconciliation in 1914. The organization held its first international conference in the Netherlands in 1919, and by 1930, similar organizations had been established in over twenty countries across Europe, America, and Asia.</p>
<p>In late 1920, Hodgkin visited China and introduced the principles of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. The Chinese branch was officially established in Beijing in 1922. The same year, a national conference was held in Shanghai, where they adopted a declaration stating: ‚ÄúWe believe that the love of Jesus Christ overcomes all the evils of the world, and therefore we will not participate in any war, be it offensive or defensive.‚Äù They argued that war does not solve problems and contradicts the love of Jesus Christ, proclaiming that ‚Äúonly goodness can combat evil.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Chinese Fellowship of Reconciliation later established its headquarters in Nanjing, forming a national committee responsible for administration, research, publicity, and communication, led by Bao Guanglin as the national officer. Over the years, they expanded their activities in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Anqing, Chengdu, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, and in 1931 published the bi-monthly magazine ‚ÄúThe Love.‚Äù Among its most notable members were Xu Paoqian and Wu Yaozong, with the latter later serving as the president of the Chinese Fellowship of Reconciliation.</p>

</ol>
<p>In early 1922, Ni Tuosheng and Wang Zai held a breaking of bread meeting at the home of Wang Zai in Fuzhou, and the attendees subsequently referred to themselves as ‚Äúbelievers gathering in the name of the Lord in Fuzhou.‚Äù In January 1923, Li Yuanru came to Fuzhou to preach at the invitation of Ni and Wang, leading to a significant number of conversions and the beginning of regular meetings at rented space on Shierling Road, organized by Ni, Wang, and Wang Lianjun. The Fuzhou meeting hall became the origin of what would be known as the ‚ÄúAssembly Hall.‚Äù During this time, Ni began publishing ‚ÄúThe Revival News.‚Äù</p>
<p>Through these shared experiences and events, participants began forming a strong community committed to spreading the message of Christianity, ultimately laying a foundation for further gatherings and the establishment of a more structured church community.(1) Dinner on the Development of Church Autonomy and Integrative Strategies</p>
<p>From 1924 to 1927, Feng Yuxiang supported the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and during this time he visited the Soviet Union, beginning to be influenced by the notion that religion was the ‚Äúopium of the people.‚Äù Eventually, military religious ceremonies and the presence of accompanying missionaries were also halted. Later, he decided to support Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs ‚ÄúClean-up the Party‚Äù movement.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Feng Yuxiang‚Äôs thoughts tilted further to the left, increasingly influenced by communist ideology. He adopted a materialistic understanding of religion, viewing it as superstitious and at odds with science. While he continued to appreciate Jesus, he also admired Marx, Engels, and Lenin. He believed that Marx‚Äôs statement to ‚Äúunite the proletarians of the world‚Äù was a ‚Äúscripture‚Äù that effectively defeated Jesus‚Äôs commandment to ‚Äúlove one another.‚Äù Feng regretted spending too much time on the Bible, reasoning that if he had concentrated on political writings instead, he would not have found himself in such a situation. Regarding God‚Äôs existence, Feng expressed skepticism, suggesting, ‚ÄúWe must rise to save ourselves; listening quietly to God will not lead to salvation!‚Äù He believed Christianity was also ‚Äúnot without superstition.‚Äù</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance against Japan, Feng‚Äôs views shifted again. Under the overarching imperative to resist Japan, he asserted that ‚Äúnationalism‚Äù took precedence over all other ‚Äúisms.‚Äù He believed that for China to achieve its goals of national survival and independence, there must be internal unity among its people. His relationship with Christianity underwent a significant transformation as well. In August 1936, he spent a month in Lushan, further contemplating religious issues. One morning, hearing hymns from a church, he was moved and remarked, ‚ÄúI know the materialistic understanding of history, yet I cannot fail to admire the immense power of religion.‚Äù He acknowledged that he was wrestling with how to maintain a balance between ‚Äúemphasizing science‚Äù and ‚Äúemphasizing religion,‚Äù while contending with the ‚Äúcontradictions‚Äù this posed. Subsequently, he resumed a more structured Bible study routine. He insisted that superstitions must be dismantled, but because the essence of Christianity is ‚Äúlove,‚Äù if Christians genuinely practice the teaching of loving their neighbors as themselves‚Äîeven sacrificing their lives for friends‚Äîthen Christianity is not merely superstition, but rather a ‚Äúscientific‚Äù truth. When Feng Yuxiang recognized that the spirit of revolution held immeasurable power during the Anti-Japanese War, the essence of Christianity‚Äîespecially the self-sacrificial spirit that had long resonated with him‚Äîdeeply attracted him once more. He admitted that the revolutionary spirit of Jesus was a crucial driving force behind the anti-invasion struggle, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ became the greatest hope and encouragement for the Chinese people during the war.</p>
<p>After the victory in the war, Feng Yuxiang‚Äôs dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek increased as the full-scale Civil War between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party erupted. After assessing water conservancy in 1946, news of the Kuomintang‚Äôs disregard for anti-civil war appeals and suppression of student movements reached him, leading to his rupture with Chiang Kai-shek. While he dedicated himself to anti-Chiang and anti-civil war propaganda, he confirmed that the contributions of Christianity to altruism would serve as a foundational element for China‚Äôs democratization, making the construction of a new democratic China his paramount goal.</p>
<p>On January 1948, Chiang Kai-shek expelled Feng from the party, citing reasons of ‚Äúimproper behavior‚Äù and ‚Äúabsurd statements,‚Äù declaring him a ‚Äúrightist.‚Äù In February, Feng established the National Revolutionary Council‚Äôs U.S. chapter in America to unify anti-Chiang forces. Shortly thereafter, determined to return to China to participate in the New Political Consultative Conference called by the Chinese Communist Party, he expressed great confidence in the Chinese democratic movement.</p>
<p>On July 31, Feng and his family boarded the ‚ÄúVictory‚Äù passenger ship, heading towards the Soviet Union to undertake his journey of returning to rebuild democracy in China. Even though he had split from Chiang, he did not completely embrace communism. He believed that the number of Marxist-Leninist followers in China was not as high as perceived and argued that most intellectuals and nationalists had turned to the Communist Party out of desperation amid oppression. Regardless, Feng remained optimistic about the political consultative conference called by the Communist Party, firmly believing that the establishment of a democratic united government was imminent. However, in late August, while the ship crossed the Atlantic Ocean and sailed through the Mediterranean into the Black Sea, reports surfaced on September 6 that Feng Yuxiang had died in a maritime fire incident, with the date of the event noted as August 31 or September 1.</p>

</ol>
<p>Wei Zhuomin (Francis C. M. Wei, 1888-1976), was born in Xiangshan County, Guangdong, into a family engaged in business for generations. He received traditional education from a young age and began studying English at age 14 with a private tutor. In 1910, Wei went to the United States, and through his involvement with the Chinese Methodist Church in Philadelphia, he learned more about Christianity and eventually converted.</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, Wei actively promoted church unity and educational initiatives among various Christian denominations in China. He participated in multiple conferences and played key roles in organizations aimed at fostering cooperation and addressing modernization in the church, particularly in response to the intellectual and social shifts occurring in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Wei played a significant role in establishing educational institutions and promoting the importance of integrating Western knowledge with Chinese traditions in the context of Christianity. His efforts contributed to a broader movement of church reform and Christian education in China, which aimed to address the contemporary challenges faced by the Chinese church in a rapidly changing society.</p>
<p>Together, both Feng Yuxiang and Wei Zhuomin exemplified the complex interplay of religious conviction, societal reforms, and the navigation of political landscapes in early 20th-century China. Their respective journeys highlighted the tensions surrounding Christianity in China during a period of significant transformation and upheaval.(1) The Impact of the Missionary Movement and the Establishment of the National Christian Council of China</p>
<p>In May 1922, the National Christian Conference was held in Shanghai, where representatives decided to establish the ‚ÄúNational Christian Council of China‚Äù to promote collaboration and church unity. This council emphasized that all matters relating to doctrine and governance were outside its scope, and it articulated a strong commitment to the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Initially, the council aimed to unify diverse Christian denominations, echoed by movements aiming at cooperation among various sects. Membership was based on the number of adherents in each denomination, which promoted inclusiveness while ensuring the representation of local church interests. By the time of its first General Assembly in 1923, the council had established several committees focusing on various aspects of Christian life and societal engagement, advocating for alignment of Christian teachings with the evolving social landscape.</p>

Hu took initiative to invite other influential Christians, resulting in the creation of a small committee in December 1922 focused on church and social issues.</p>
<p>The group began publishing ‚ÄúThe Truth Weekly‚Äù in April 1923, deeply emphasizing the need for churches to engage with the cultural and social issues of the time.

It aimed to promote peace and non-violence. By coordinating efforts with various religious groups in China, the Fellowship sought to unify efforts in advocating for peace during a turbulent time.</p>
<p>This organization facilitated widespread discourse on peace, advocating for collaborative efforts among Christians to reject war and promote coexistence.

</ol>
<p>In 1920, the Peking Apologetic Group was established by a coalition of Chinese and foreign Christians responding to the challenge posed by the May Fourth Movement. They believed that the current environment called for a concerted effort to counter misunderstandings regarding Christianity and to support the reform of the Chinese church.</p>
<p>The group facilitated discussions addressing the relationship between contemporary social issues and Christian teachings, aiming to reaffirm the transformative potential of Christianity in Chinese society. Their initiatives included publishing works that highlighted the integration of faith and the application of Christ‚Äôs teachings in addressing social injustices.</p>

<li>Anti-Christian Sentiment and Conflicts</li>
</ol>
<p>The dialogue within the church regarding the issue of ancestral worship reflected broader societal tensions. While some advocated for compromise and integration, others insisted on strict adherence to missionary principles without yielding to local customs. This divergence underscored the complexities of navigating faith in a culturally rich and diverse society like China.</p>
<p>In summary, the developments in church movements, educational initiatives, and social engagements during this period significantly influenced the Christian landscape in China, shaping the interactions between missionaries and Chinese believers while responding to the broader cultural transformations in the 20th century. The ongoing discussions and efforts highlighted both the potential for cooperation and the challenges presented by differing theological positions and societal expectations.(1) The Jesus Family (ËÄ∂Á©åÂÆ∂Â∫≠), 1927 (Èô∂È£õ‰∫û 2004; Lian 2010: 64-84; Bays 1996: 312-313)</p>
<p>The Jesus Family emerged as one of the indigenous Christian sects in China during the early 20th century, founded by Jing Dianyong (Êï¨Â•†ÁÄõ) in Shandong‚Äôs Mazhuang in the 1920s. The group initially began with the ‚ÄúSaints‚Äô Credit Savings Society‚Äù (ËÅñÂæí‰ø°Áî®ÂÑ≤ËìÑÁ§æ) in 1921 and the ‚ÄúMulberry and Silk Learning House‚Äù (Ë†∂Ê°ëÂ≠∏ÈÅìÊàø) in 1926, ultimately establishing the ‚ÄúJesus Family‚Äù in 1927. The Jesus Family aimed to create a communal living environment centered around ‚Äúhome‚Äù (both big and small families), committed to shared living and property. Due to Jing‚Äôs background, the Jesus Family integrated traditional Confucian, Daoist ethics with Christianity, becoming a representative of the indigenous Christian movement in China.</p>
<p>Having been exposed to Christianity early on, Jing was influenced by various missionaries and began exploring indigenous forms of Christianity. He established the first Jesus Family in Shandong‚Äôs Mazhuang and emphasized daily spiritual practices, Bible reading, and prayer, placing significant value on hymns. He wrote many hymns that expressed the pursuit of an ideal society (e.g., ‚ÄúAs the Elder Loves the Younger,‚Äù ‚ÄúLiving by the Lord Is Not Difficult,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Strife or Grievance,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Borders for Races and Nations,‚Äù etc.). However, as the leader of the larger ‚Äúfamily,‚Äù Jing also established a position of high authority.</p>
<p>The Jesus Family reached its peak during the 1930s and 1940s, with thousands of believers across Shandong and Hebei. During the Anti-Japanese War, there was an average increase of eight new families annually. Shandong served as the center, accounting for 62% of the national total. By 1949, there were a total of 104 ‚Äúfamilies,‚Äù with 12,000 believers. At that time, due to its ‚Äúcommunal‚Äù structure, it actually gained recognition from certain mainstream Christian groups. The Jesus Family also actively supported the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, with 381 members from the Jesus Family among the first signatories of the Three-Self Declaration in Shandong, constituting a significant portion of the signatories.</p>
<p>However, the Jesus Family later faced accusations of being a ‚Äúfeudal regime.‚Äù In 1952, a national task force from the Three-Self movement visited Mazhuang, and during the attempt to expose issues, Jing became a primary target. They not only accused him of issues related to his lifestyle and morals but also characterized the Jesus Family as a dark and reactionary organization. The ‚Äúreforms‚Äù of the Jesus Family meant it was the first Christian sect to be ‚Äúdismantled‚Äù after the establishment of the Communist regime in China.</p>

<li>The Chinese Foreign Missionary Union, 1929 (Ê¢ÅÂÆ∂È∫ü 1999: 22, 86-89, 125-126; ÂΩ≠‰Ω©Ë©© 2004: 95-98)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chinese Foreign Missionary Union, established in 1929, was the first missionary organization from Chinese churches to engage in overseas missions. It was founded by Pastor Robert A. Jaffray of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Jaffray arrived in China in 1897 and took on significant responsibilities not only in Guangxi but also regarding evangelistic work in the French colonial territory of Annam (Vietnam).</p>
<p>In 1900, after learning about the Boxer Uprising, Jaffray determined to expand his ministry to serve the Chinese diaspora. He established an evangelistic outpost in Da Nang in 1911. In 1916, he was appointed president of the Vietnam Mission with the headquarters in Wuzhou, Guangxi. In January 1928, he traveled to Indonesia for pioneering work. By then, graduates from the Wuzhou Christian Bible School were already serving in Annam and Indonesia. In 1927, he called upon Bible students to embark on missionary efforts in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Following his exploration in Borneo and Indonesia in 1929, he returned to Wuzhou and founded a temporary committee to develop the Southeast Asia work, composed of Chinese coworkers from the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Although the American Christian and Missionary Alliance did not support Jaffray‚Äôs proposals for expanding into Southeast Asia financially, they believed it was essential to focus on Southern China and Annam.</p>
<p>In summary, these developments showcase the evolution of missionary efforts in China and the broader aspirations for church unity and international outreach during a transformative period for China in the early 20th century, amidst escalating social and political changes.In March 1929, Robert A. Jaffray established the ‚ÄúSoutheast Asia Evangelical Mission,‚Äù with Wang Zai serving as the team leader and Jaffray as the deputy leader and treasurer. Other members included Zhao Liutang, Huang Yuansu, Liang Xigao, and Wang Zhi, and the headquarters was located in Wuzhou. In October, to emphasize that this was the first missionary organization led by Chinese people, they renamed it the ‚ÄúChinese Foreign Missionary Union.‚Äù The funding primarily came from Jaffray, who actively raised resources, alongside Chinese missionaries who relied on faith-based fundraising. By 1930, Jaffray resigned as the president of the South China Missionary Society to focus entirely on his mission work in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, many graduates from the Wuzhou Christian Bible School were sent to Southeast Asia. Over the course of 13 years, the mission dispatched 20 Chinese coworkers, trained 30 foreign coworkers, and employed 140 local workers, establishing five churches across 139 locations.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, Jaffray was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Makassar, where he passed away in July 1945. The loss of leadership, combined with financial difficulties, significantly impacted the mission‚Äôs activities.</p>

<p>In April 1922, the World‚Äôs Student Christian Federation (WSCF) held its eleventh annual meeting at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Founded in 1895 by John R.

<p>In 1896, the ‚ÄúChinese Student Christian Association‚Äù was formed and became a member of the WSCF. Later, the Chinese YMCA and the Women‚Äôs Christian Association also joined. Following WSCF protocol, the meetings were held biennially. During the General Committee meeting in 1920, Chinese representatives proposed holding the next conference in Beijing. This request was reiterated in 1921 at the WSCF executive committee meeting held in the Netherlands by Gu Ziren, leading to the decision to host the eleventh annual meeting in Beijing.</p>
<p>The National YMCA of China actively prepared for the conference and designated Tsinghua University as the meeting venue. The conference took place from April 4 to 9 and drew representatives from 32 countries, with 146 foreign delegates and over 400 Chinese attendees. The theme was ‚ÄúChristianity and the Transformation of the World,‚Äù with discussions spanning six different topics: (1) international and interethnic issues; (2) the transformation of society and industry through Christianity; (3) how to promote Christianity among modern students; (4) the Christianization of school life; (5) responsibilities within student church communities; and (6) how to strengthen the WSCF as a powerful entity globally.</p>
<p>The news of the conference being held in Beijing directly ignited anti-Christian movements in places like Beijing and Shanghai. Moreover, the conference passed a resolution to establish a Christian educational movement in China, marking a new chapter in the development of Christian students‚Äô movements in the country.</p>

<li>The National Christian Conference of China, 1922 (ÂÖ®Á¥πÊ≠¶ 1922; ÊÆµÁê¶ 2004: 209-215)</li>
</ol>
<p>From May 2 to 11, 1922, the National Christian Conference of China was convened at the Municipal Hall in Shanghai, with the overarching theme being ‚ÄúThe Chinese Church.‚Äù A total of 1,112 representatives from churches across the country attended (of which 564 were Chinese representatives). Unlike the previous three national Christian conferences held in 1877, 1890, and 1907‚Äîeach organized exclusively by missionaries without official Chinese representation (with only a few attending in 1907 in an observational capacity)‚Äîthe 1922 national conference featured over half of its attendees as Chinese representatives. The conference was presided over by Cheng Jingyi, who delivered the opening address. F. S. Brockman gave the closing address titled ‚ÄúThe Spirit of Unity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Other notable Chinese speakers included: Zhao Zichen presenting on ‚ÄúThe Strengths and Weaknesses of the Chinese Church,‚Äù Liu Tingfang on ‚ÄúThe Christian Church in China,‚Äù Luo Yunyan on ‚ÄúIssues concerning Church Leaders,‚Äù Fan Yurong on ‚ÄúWomen in Leadership,‚Äù Wu Junming on ‚ÄúChristian Educational Development in China,‚Äù and Wei Zhuomin on ‚ÄúThe Position of Christian Education in China.‚Äù</p>
<p>The conference structured its work around five major themes: (1) the current state of Christianity in China; (2) the future works of Christianity in China; (3) the mission of the church; (4) leadership within church activities; and (5) the need for cooperative efforts in church operations. Notably, the third theme concerning the church‚Äôs mission was entirely led by Chinese representatives, with no missionary involvement, and was headed by Cheng Jingyi. Each thematic group drafted reports shared during the conference. The declaration from the third group, which could be considered a contemporary confessional statement of faith for the Chinese church, was divided into two parts: ‚ÄúA Address to Fellow Christians‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Address to the People of the Nation.‚Äù In addition to the reports, the conference also included discussions on education, healthcare, literacy efforts, industrial and economic issues, women‚Äôs roles in the church, and evangelistic work.(1) The Records of the National Christian Conference, 1922</p>
<p>The records of the National Christian Conference were published in both Chinese and English in Shanghai: ‚ÄúThe Report of the National Christian Conference‚Äù (1922) and ‚ÄúThe Chinese Church as Revealed in the National Christian Conference‚Äù (1922).</p>

</ol>
<p>Following the establishment of the China Continuation Committee, a comprehensive survey of the situation of Christianity in China was conducted, the results of which were published in ‚ÄúThe Christian Occupation of China: A General Survey of the Numerical Strength and Geographical Distribution of the Christian Forces in China,‚Äù edited by Milton T. Stauffer and published by the China Continuation Committee in 1922. In addition to the English report, a portion of the content was translated into Chinese by Lu Shiyin, with the Chinese title changed to ‚ÄúThe Christian Occupation of China: A Statistical Study of Christian Work in China,‚Äù published by the Shanghai Commercial Press in 1922. In the 1980s, the Institute of World Religions of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences published a complete translation of the Chinese report under the title ‚ÄúThe Christian Occupation of China: A Statistical Study of Christian Work (1901-1920)‚Äù (Beijing: China Social Sciences Press, 1985), which was reprinted in 2007.</p>
<p>The impetus for the survey originated from the China Continuation Committee‚Äôs decision in 1916 to form a Special Committee on Survey and Occupation to conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the state of Christianity in China. The committee undertaken detailed discussions concerning how to conduct the survey and statistical analysis, drafting questionnaires and focusing on collecting information relevant to the 1918 situation. The survey was conducted and completed under the leadership of Milton T. Stauffer in 1922.</p>
<p>The report consists of fifteen sections, providing background information on China and organizing the development of Christianity in the country, especially analyzing the reforms and progress from 1900 to 1920. A key emphasis of the report was to present the status of churches in each province through statistical data analysis, including the number of missionaries, Chinese believers, and clergy, as well as the number of churches, and the distribution of various missionary societies across different regions. Additionally, it explored the state of Christian endeavors in provinces‚Äîincluding church schools, hospitals, and other enterprises‚Äîwhile conducting comparative studies in various directions. It also provided analysis on topics concerning specific demographics (different ethnic groups, the blind, fishermen, youth, different workers, etc.), as well as the conditions of the Chinese church, education, medical initiatives, and literacy efforts. It further touched upon the situation of Roman Catholicism and the Russian Orthodox Church in China.</p>
<p>This report remains the most detailed and comprehensive statistical analysis of Christian missionary work in China to date. However, the English title ‚ÄúChristian Occupation of China‚Äù later became a term used in anti-Christian movements to accuse Christianity of being an instrument of imperialist aggression.</p>

<li>Christianity and Rural Development, 1922 (Èô≥Âª£Âüπ 2001: 117-120)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the early 20th century, more than 80% of the Chinese population lived in rural areas, primarily engaged in agriculture. Rural issues were undeniably a critical aspect of China‚Äôs path toward modernization. Christians recognized that addressing rural education and socioeconomic challenges was essential to foster both national reconstruction and the spread of Christian teachings. Missionaries and church organizations increasingly sought to engage with rural communities, aiming to promote education and self-improvement through various initiatives. This focus on rural development would play a vital role in shaping both the Christian mission and social reform efforts in the decades to come.(1) The National Christian Council of China, 1922</p>
<p>In May 1922, the ‚ÄúNational Christian Conference‚Äù convened in Shanghai aimed at promoting cooperation and unity among various churches. The representatives resolved to form the ‚ÄúNational Christian Council of China,‚Äù which announced that all matters concerning doctrine and church governance would not fall under its domain. They issued a declaration affirming their commitment to the Christian faith: ‚ÄúWe believe and reaffirm our loyalty to God, the Almighty Father; to Jesus Christ, His Son, our Lord and Savior, who loved us and sacrificed Himself for our sins; and to the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life; we also recognize our loyalty to the Holy Spirit as the supreme guide for our faith and actions, acknowledging the core Christian beliefs of our respective churches.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the Council‚Äôs charter, it included various responsibilities such as fostering unity among Chinese Christian churches, promoting the Chinese national church, facilitating evangelism, and nurturing leadership. The Council operated on a membership basis derived from various denominations and societies, with representatives selected according to their adherents, resulting in a structure that encouraged different traditions to collaborate. The first General Assembly was held in May 1923 and represented a significant step in the movement toward church unity.</p>

<li>The Chinese Bible Union, 1920</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bible Union of China was established in August 1920 by a group of fundamentalist missionaries in response to the rise of modernism. Following a speech by William H. G. Thomas, a prominent fundamentalist, at a missionary retreat, about 20 missionaries gathered and formed a national alliance. They issued a declaration asserting the need to contend earnestly for the faith as revealed in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the importance of biblical authority amid the challenges of modernist interpretations.</p>
<p>The activities of the Bible Union centered on promoting traditional Christian doctrine, which they believed was under threat. They positioned themselves as defenders of the faith, facilitating discussions and supporting literature that opposed liberal theological positions. However, the more radical stance of the Union contrasted with the more moderate positions held by other organizations.</p>

<li>The Jesus Family, 1927</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jesus Family, founded by Jing Dianyong in the early 20th century, emerged from a desire to create a communal Christian society that integrated traditional Chinese values with Christianity. Establishing a model of shared living and communal responsibilities, the Jesus Family attracted many followers during the 1930s and 1940s, especially in Shandong and Hebei. The group aimed to empower the local community economically and socially, emphasizing daily spiritual practices and education tailored to the needs of the congregation.</p>

<li>Zhou Han and Early Anti-Missionary Literature</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhou Han, a key figure in the anti-missionary sentiment, utilized his writing to critique the presence and practices of foreign missionaries in China, reflecting the growing dissatisfaction among Chinese intellectuals and the broader society. Zhou‚Äôs works spurred discussions on identity, culture, and the encroachment of foreign influences, contributing significantly to the intellectual landscape of early 20th-century China.</p>
<p>Overall, these developments during the early 20th century reflect the multifaceted interactions between Chinese society and Christianity, illustrating the challenges and the evolving dynamics present in the mission fields as they navigated cultural, social, and political landscapes.(1) The Impact of Sun Yat-sen‚Äôs Death on Christian Practices</p>
<p>When Sun Yat-sen passed away on March 12, 1925, due to liver disease, significant debates arose regarding the arrangement of his funeral. According to historical accounts, including one recorded by Bao Shijie in his diary, tensions escalated within the Nationalist Party regarding whether the funeral should adhere to Christian rites or reflect revolutionary ideals. One faction argued that since Sun was a Christian, it was appropriate to conduct his funeral according to Christian customs, while another faction contended that as a revolutionary leader, the rites should reflect the essence of the revolution and not be appropriated by any particular religion. Some younger party members suggested strong measures, implying that if Christian rites were insisted upon, they would forcefully intervene.</p>
<p>With mediation from figures such as Wang Jingwei, coupled with the resolve of the Northern Army‚Äôs Zhang Zhonglin, an agreement was ultimately reached. They decided to conduct a religious memorial service in the hall of the hospital where Sun‚Äôs body was laid, with the service featuring leaders and attendees drawn from a mix of political and religious backgrounds.</p>
<p>Among those participating in the service was Liu Tingfang, who delivered the message that Sun was the foremost figure in China and today ascended to meet God. The service included hymns and prayers, and attendees demonstrated a sense of mourning and gratitude toward the legacy of Sun‚Äôs life.</p>

<li>The May 30 Incident and Christianity, 1925 (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 1997: 124-125, 222-232)</li>
</ol>
<p>The infamous ‚ÄúMay 30 Incident‚Äù occurred in Shanghai in May 1925, peaking the growing national anti-imperialist sentiment. The incident began in early May when a Japanese textile factory in Shanghai triggered a strike after the dismissal of workers, leading to clashes between workers and the factory. Security guards and the police attempted to disperse the workers, resulting in Japanese nationals opening fire and injuring workers like Gu Zhenghong, who later died from his injuries.</p>
<p>On May 23, two university students were arrested for supporting the workers. The next day, during a memorial meeting for Gu Zhenghong held by student organizations, four students were detained by the police for protesting in the foreign concessions. Six students were scheduled to face trial on May 30. That morning, students from Nanyang University and Fudan University organized a ‚ÄúStudent Speaking Group‚Äù and marched outside the school. When the students entered the British Concession, workers joined the demonstration, and the crowd became increasingly agitated. The police forcefully dispersed the assembly, arresting several speakers and taking them to the old station on Nanjing Road. As the crowd continued to gather outside, about 2,000 people were present, leading to tensions rising.</p>
<p>The station head, E. W. Everson, first raised his gun as a warning before opening fire, with other police following suit. The result was four people killed on the spot, seven severely injured (who later succumbed to their injuries), and numerous others injured. This tragic event became known as the ‚ÄúMay 30 Incident.‚Äù During this period, nearly 10,000 civil groups were mobilized, launching a large-scale anti-British imperialist propaganda movement, with Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou becoming the epicenters of the anti-imperialist movement following the ‚ÄúMay 30 Incident.‚Äù</p>
<p>The incident and the subsequent popular outrage significantly impacted the relationship between Christianity and Chinese society. The involvement of missionaries and the churches provided an avenue for mobilizing support and for criticizing colonial attitudes, mirroring broader societal dissatisfaction and galvanizing further movements for change.(1) The Tianjin Incident and the Anti-Imperialist Sentiment, 1925</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the May 30 Incident, the Shanghai newspaper Shen Bao published a total of 38 reports from both Chinese and foreign Christians and organizations in response to the tragedy between June 2 and July 19. It is evident that the Shanghai churches and congregants played a crucial role, with the Chinese Christian Union in Shanghai becoming a key point of contact for Christians nationwide. The Jesus Family opposed the massacre of Chinese individuals, advocating for actions based on ‚Äújustice.‚Äù Moreover, organizations such as the National Association of the YMCA, the Women‚Äôs Christian Association, and the National Christian Council generally agreed on the establishment of an investigative committee composed of both Chinese and Western representatives to look into the incident. Some foreign missionaries even acknowledged that the British bore some responsibility for the situation. However, on June 9, Harry Westidge, a missionary from the China Inland Mission, suggested during a public trial that ‚Äúif he speaks from the perspective of a clergyman, he would oppose murder, but from the perspective of a legal expert and police officer, he must resort to gunfire,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI believe the instigators of this incident are the students, not the police.‚Äù Such words ignited a fierce backlash from Chinese believers, who perceived them as biased in favor of the British and demanded an apology from the missionary, with some also calling for the China Inland Mission to reprimand him. Chinese Christians accused the missionary of undermining their dignity and beliefs, and referred the matter to their church overseer with a request for his return to the United States. However, the overseer dismissed these concerns, stating that the Chinese believers were overly sensitive. As a result, over 40 members of the China Inland Mission publicly called for separation from the mission.</p>
<p>The May 30 Incident undoubtedly stoked the flames of anti-imperialist sentiment nationwide, pushing the anti-Christian movement to new heights.</p>

<li>The National Christian Conference of China, 1925 (ÁéãÊ≤ªÂøÉ 1925: 1-2)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1925, the National Christian Conference of China was established, with Wang Zhixin serving as the initiator. The motivation for its establishment highlighted that ‚Äúthe foreign powers are oppressing our nation through unequal treaties, causing immense suffering‚Äù and that this Christian spirit of struggle calls for a resistance against these malevolent forces, promoting the movement to abolish the unequal treaties.</p>
<p>Wang emphasized that the Association would operate without any partisan bias, allowing any Christian from the Republic of China to participate. Even if Christian participants belonged to specific political parties, they could join based on their identity as Christians, provided they did not use the organization for party activities. This was a totally spontaneous organization among Chinese Christians, although Western friends could act as supporters but could not become formal members.</p>
<p>The rationale for forming the Association included four points: (1) Christianity advocates for equality, opposing unequal treaties; (2) many unequal treaties are connected to church incidents but are not directly related to Christianity itself. However, Christianity bears significant responsibility for the calamity that arose upon its introduction to China; (3) many nationalists criticized Christianity as an extension of imperialism, and thus genuine Christians should oppose unequal treaties, exemplifying the peace spirit of Christ and equality; (4) the Eastern Christian Educational Union had previously passed a resolution calling for the abolition of unequal treaties, necessitating the formation of an organization to actualize this resolution.</p>
<p>Thus, the formation of the Association aimed to garner national attention among Christians to support the movement while communicating with international Christian organizations to advocate for the abolition of these treaties. Additionally, it planned to study the contents of the unequal treaties and explore methods used by other countries to abolish such treaties.</p>

<p>In collaboration with the National Christian Council of China, an informal meeting known as the ‚ÄúMott Conference‚Äù was held from January 5 to 7, 1922. John R. Mott and nearly thirty representatives discussed seven primary themes: (1) spiritual preparedness of the Chinese church to meet the present situation; (2) making Christianity indigenous in China; (3) Christian literature; (4) principles guiding missionary policy in China moving forward; (5) relationships between the Christian church and China‚Äôs treaties with foreign nations; (6) Christian education; and (7) recommendations for international meetings.</p>
<p>During the conference, Mott particularly urged the representatives to ‚Äúimprint a deep understanding of the current conditions, trends, and most pressing issues facing China in their minds.

<p>From August 18 to 28, 1927, the National Christian Council of China convened the ‚ÄúConference on Christianizing Economic Relations.‚Äù The conference centered around three major themes: (1) issues relating to industrial conditions, such as wages, working hours, employer relations, apprenticeship systems, labor movements, and the living conditions of workers; (2) rural economic issues, examining tenant farming, market cooperation, and agricultural associations from an ethical perspective; and (3) the relationship between Christianity and the economic questions of private property, inheritance, wages, economic competition, and personal income, applying contemporary social thought and Christian ethics. The conference‚Äôs foundational belief was: ‚ÄúTo generate the desired new society, the Spirit of God must operate within individuals and groups.‚Äù They acknowledged that ‚Äúthe evils of great wealth should be curtailed, focusing on monitoring income and expenditures and promoting the ideal of ‚Äòfrom each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>The conference notably invited Japanese Christian socialist thinker Toyohiko Kagawa, who gave a devotional talk on ‚ÄúReflections of Christ on Social Movements‚Äù and delivered speeches on ‚ÄúThe Church and Economic Issues‚Äù and ‚ÄúJapanese Social Movements.‚Äù Representatives reported on the conditions of workers and labor movements in Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, Changzhou, and Wuxi, as well as the peasant movements in Guangdong.</p>

</ol>
<p>The Guangzhou Spiritual Conference was held in July 1927 for a duration of 14 days. It was initiated by Pastor Huang Yuansu from the Christian and Missionary Alliance, stemming from an experience where he and three others, including Pastor Zhao Liutang, were robbed by bandits while returning to Wuzhou, resulting in their captivity for a total of 156 days (from August 18, 1925, to January 21, 1926). During their time in captivity, the four engaged in Bible reading, finding spiritual comfort. After their release, Huang reflected on the experience, likening it to Jonah in the belly of a fish, which led them to a prolonged self-examination and spiritual growth; ultimately, the four experienced significant spiritual advancement. This led to the concept of initiating ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù gatherings.Under the promotion of Pastor Huang Yuansu, a committee was established, including members such as Zhao Liutang, Wu Zikun, Luo Xiaochuan, Zheng Deyin, and Lin Boluo, as well as missionaries like Arthur G. Lindquist from the Alliance Church and R. A. Jaffray from the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</p>
<p>Speakers at the Guangzhou Spiritual Conference included Wang Zai, Huang Yuansu, Philip Hinkey, Davis, Zhao Liutang, Li Qirong, Luo Shengai, and R. A. Jaffray. The first day‚Äôs meeting was held at the Zengsha Methodist Church; due to a large attendance, the venue was changed on the second day to the Savior Church of the Anglican Church on Wanfulu.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic response to the Guangzhou Spiritual Conference led to a similar initiative in Hong Kong the following year (1928), where a sister conference was formed. In July, the conference was first held in Guangzhou, followed by an event in August in Hong Kong, officially naming it the first ‚ÄúGuangdong-Hong Kong Spiritual Conference.‚Äù Starting in 1929, it was referred to as the first ‚ÄúGuangdong-Hong Kong Spiritual Conference,‚Äù and it has been held annually since, becoming a significant event in the Christian community in South China.

<li>The Theological Conflict Between Old and New Missionaries in China (Bates 1974: 135-158; ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2001: 21-23)</li>
</ol>
<p>Entering the 20th century, with the rise of the Social Gospel, Modernism, and Liberal Theology, an increasing number of missionaries began to substantially revise the content of the Gospel, both in North America and in overseas mission fields. In response to the subversion of traditional doctrines by Liberal Theology, Fundamentalists started to unify their efforts, becoming the antithesis of Liberal Theology on the stage of 20th-century church history.</p>
<p>Fundamentalism refers to a religious or theological movement that originated in the United States, broadly encompassing conservative Christians who opposed Liberal Theology and sought to defend ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù doctrines. They could not accept the approach of Liberal Theology that elevated rationalism as the sole standard for determining whether traditional doctrines should be abandoned in response to the challenges posed by the Enlightenment. They keenly felt the threat posed by the rise of Liberal Theology to evangelicalism, particularly its denial of the authority of Scripture, and thus united to oppose the modernist theologians, often adopting a militant posture in their contention against Liberal Theology. Fundamentalists mainly defended five core doctrines: (1) the inerrancy and inspiration of Scripture; (2) the deity of Christ</p>

<li>The Debate Between Old and New Theology Among Missionaries in China (Bates 1974: 135-158; ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 2001: 21-23)</li>
</ol>
<p>Entering the 20th century, with the rise of Social Gospel and Modernism or Liberal Theology, more and more missionaries began to significantly revise the essence of the Gospel in both North America and overseas mission fields. In response to the subversion of traditional doctrines by liberal theology, fundamentalists began to unite their efforts, becoming the ‚Äúantithesis‚Äù to liberal theology on the stage of 20th-century church history.</p>
<p>Fundamentalism refers to a religious or theological movement that originated in the United States, broadly encompassing conservative church figures who rose to defend the ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù doctrines due to dissatisfaction with liberal theology. They could not agree with the approach taken by liberal theology, which elevated reason as the sole standard for judging whether traditional doctrines should be abandoned in response to the challenges posed by the Enlightenment. They deeply felt the threat that the rise of liberal theology posed to evangelicalism, especially in its denial of biblical authority, and thus united in opposition to theological modernists, often adopting a militant stance against liberal theology. Fundamentalists primarily defend five core doctrines: (1) The inspiration and Infallibility of Scripture; (2) The Deity of Christ, including His Virgin Birth; (3) The Substitutionary Atonement of Christ‚Äôs Death; (4) The Literal Resurrection of Christ from the Dead; (5) The Literal Return of Christ in the Second Advent.</p>
<p>The theological debate between fundamentalism and liberalism became an important event in the history of missionary work in the 20th century, and the situation in China was no exception. In 1920, the famous North American fundamentalist W. H. Griffith Thomas visited China. After returning to his home country, he expressed deep concern about the modernist tendencies among missionaries in China and published an article titled ‚ÄúModernism in China,‚Äù which sparked broader debates. For fundamentalist missionaries, almost all substantial national Christian organizations in China at that time had been dominated by liberalism. For example, the China National Christian Council and the China Christian YMCA had evidently become strongholds of modernism. In 1926, the China Inland Mission and the Evangelical Missionary Alliance withdrew from the China National Christian Council due to theological differences, intensifying the opposition between old and new theology.</p>
<p>ÂßöË•ø‰ºä pointed out that the focus of this theological debate in China primarily revolved around three major issues: the authority of the Bible, evangelism and social participation, and how to view Chinese religions. In contrast, the controversy over evolution and creation that triggered intense debates in North America did not become a major ‚Äúhotspot‚Äù in China (ÂßöË•ø‰ºä 1999: 194-204). ËøûÊõ¶ further emphasized that it was ‚Äúreligious syncretism‚Äù rather than higher criticism that became one of the significant characteristics of liberal theology in China. The debate on new and old theology in China was not merely an imported ‚Äúforeign product‚Äù from North America; the theological debates of the 1920s and 1930s in China also had a reflex influence on North America (Lian 1997: 171-206).(2) Christian Salvation of the Nation (ÈÇ¢Á¶èÂ¢û 1997a: 67-71; 1997b: 400-403)</p>
<p>During the Republican period, Christian intellectual elites bravely faced various challenges and dedicated themselves to literary creations. Through the publication of magazines such as ‚ÄúLife,‚Äù ‚ÄúTruth,‚Äù ‚ÄúTruth and Life,‚Äù ‚ÄúYouth Progress,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmethyst,‚Äù ‚ÄúLiterary Society,‚Äù ‚ÄúTian Jia,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeavenly Wind,‚Äù they engaged in extensive discussions and practices regarding contextual theology and liturgical construction, reflecting on the relationship between Christianity and the reconstruction of Chinese society, leaving a rich and valuable legacy for Chinese theology. The salvation of the nation or national reconstruction became the ultimate concern of the Chinese people in the 20th century. The realities of crisis led to a cultural crisis, forcing concerned intellectuals to examine and explore the future of Chinese culture from an ideological and cultural perspective. For Chinese Christians, the question of what role Christianity plays in the reconstruction of Chinese society became a topic they were deeply engaged in. Salvation theology became an important focal point of contextualization in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Examining the history of China in the 20th century, many intellectuals (including Christians) tended to think of the issues of ‚Äúsalvation of the nation‚Äù and cultural reconstruction in a ‚Äúmonistic‚Äù ideological framework. They were eager to find solutions to the predicaments faced by China, reducing complex national, social, and cultural issues to fundamental ‚Äúcore‚Äù problems (such as corruption of public sentiment and imperialism). At the same time, they hoped to quickly identify a fundamental solution to these problems, thereby facilitating the reconstruction of Chinese society. Thus, ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Democracy‚Äù (Democracy), ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Science‚Äù (Science), ‚ÄúMiss Aesthetics,‚Äù ‚ÄúConfucius‚Äù (New Confucianism), ‚ÄúMiss Moral Ethics,‚Äù ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Sun‚Äù (Three Principles of the People), and ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Marx‚Äù (Marxism) all took the historical stage, attempting to prove their salvific function to the nation. At a time of vibrant discourse and rising talents, ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Christianity‚Äù also represented the Chinese church in the competition, hoping that Christianity could become a good remedy for addressing China‚Äôs problems, thereby achieving the grand vision of ‚ÄúChina returning to the Lord.‚Äù</p>
<p>Although the Chinese church regarded Christianity as the only solution to China‚Äôs issues and a ‚Äúunique offering‚Äù (as said by ÁéãÊ≤ªÂøÉ), there were differing understandings among Christians from various backgrounds regarding how Christianity could save the nation. In other words, ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Christianity‚Äù appeared before the people in different forms: (1) Jesus as the Rebuilder of Moral Character. This view holds that the fundamental problem of Chinese culture lies in the renewal of character and public sentiment, with Jesus being the model of ideal and perfect character. Jesus‚Äô love, sacrifice, and spirit of self-denial are precisely the cure for China‚Äôs moral and spiritual problems and serve as the cultural foundation for social reconstruction. (2) Jesus as the Social Reformer. Proponents believe that China‚Äôs issues stem from various shortcomings in society. Therefore, Christians should engage in social reforms at different levels (such as education and rural construction). Jesus‚Äô greatest mission during His time on earth was to promote awareness of social reform, laying the foundation for the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. (3) Jesus as the Social Revolutionary. This group of Christians emphasizes that to fundamentally solve China‚Äôs problems, one cannot rely solely on improvements at the individual level; instead, it is necessary to establish new systems through revolutionary means to fulfill the mission of national reconstruction. Jesus himself serves as a typical revolutionary model. The nature of the revolution that aligns with Christian ideals varies according to differing revolutionary positions‚ÄîJesus can support both the national revolution of the Three Principles of the People and the socialist revolution.</p>
<p>In summary, at a time when China was in a critical survival situation and undergoing drastic changes in culture, Chinese Christians in the 1920s worked to demonstrate that Christianity was the only way to save the nation by interpreting it as a faith with a strong communal redemptive significance. In this way, Jesus not only became the ‚Äúsecular Messiah,‚Äù losing His divine essence, but also became an accessory to various secular salvation plans or ideologies. The different images of Jesus illustrate that Chinese Christians first confirmed the roots of China‚Äôs problems and then sought solutions before packaging those solutions with Christianity. Ultimately, Christianity only played the role of legitimizing or sanctifying these secular plans. The diverse representations of Jesus Christ in 20th-century China reflect the dilemmas faced by the Chinese church as it sought to integrate Christianity with national reconstruction.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Cai Yuanpei (Zhang Qinshi 1928: 1-9, 199-201)</li>
</ol>
<p>Cai Yuanpei (Ëî°ÂÖÉÂüπ, 1868-1940), a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, was distinguished as a scholar in the imperial examinations in 1892 and was appointed as a junior member of the Hanlin Academy. He became interested in current affairs and Western learning in the afternoon of his life, later sympathizing with the revolution. After the founding of the Republic of China, he served as the Minister of Education. When Yuan Shikai became president, he continued to serve as the Director General of Education for the Beijing government. However, he resigned a few months later due to dissatisfaction with Yuan‚Äôs autocratic rule. In 1916, he was appointed president of Peking University, promoting the spirit of intellectual freedom and becoming an important figure in the New Culture Movement, supporting students during the May Fourth Movement. In October 1927, he became the president of the Academia Sinica (the Ministry of Education), and the following year, he became the president of the Central Research Institute. After the September 18 Incident, he supported the resistance against Japan and participated in the Shanghai Cultural Salvation Association. At the end of 1937, he moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong, where he passed away in 1940.</p>
<p>In 1917, Cai published an article titled ‚ÄúUsing Aesthetic Education Instead of Religion‚Äù in ‚ÄúXin Qingnian‚Äù (New Youth), discussing the role of religion from the perspectives of intellect, will, and emotion. He pointed out that due to advancements in science, knowledge and will had become ‚Äúindependent,‚Äù and the remaining emotional role of religion could be replaced by ‚Äúaesthetic education.‚Äù This article ignited discussions in the intellectual community regarding religious issues during the New Culture Movement.</p>
<p>In April 1922, the Beijing Non-Religious Alliance held a non-religious conference, where Cai Yuanpei delivered a speech stating, ‚ÄúAll religions today are bound by outdated doctrines, using absurd rituals and exaggerated propaganda to elicit blind faith from the uneducated to sustain the lives of the missionaries.‚Äù Therefore, religion is undoubtedly ‚Äúan external force invading the individual‚Äôs spiritual realm,‚Äù violating human rights. He strongly opposed church schools and the YMCA, which ‚Äúuse various suggestions to tempt underage students to believe in their Christianity.‚Äù For this reason, he advocated for ‚Äúeducational independence,‚Äù asserting that it must be ‚Äútranscendent to all denominations‚Äù and specifically stated that (1) universities could offer courses in the history of religion and comparative religion but should not have theological studies; (2) no school should have courses that promote doctrines or conduct prayer services; (3) those who engage in proselytism should not participate in educational endeavors. In response to the World Student Christian Federation annual meeting, Cai questioned why these students ‚Äúwould wish to carry a Christian title,‚Äù and he also questioned Tsinghua University about why it ‚Äúwould provide a venue for a religious alliance.‚Äù He supported the establishment of a ‚ÄúNon-Religious Alliance,‚Äù reiterating that this did not hinder ‚Äúfreedom of belief,‚Äù because ‚Äúto believe is freedom, and to not believe is also freedom.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince we have this ‚Äònon-religious‚Äô belief and encounter the necessity of this ‚Äònon-religious‚Äô movement, we are free to conduct our movement without any reservations!‚Äù</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei‚Äôs advocacy for the separation of religion and education was implemented when he became the president of the ‚ÄúAcademy‚Äù in 1927. In December, the Academy announced the ‚ÄúRegulations for the Establishment of Private Universities and Specialized Schools‚Äù and ‚ÄúRegulations for the Establishment of Private Secondary Schools and Primary Schools,‚Äù with the underlying spirit being the separation of religion from education. Church schools at all levels could not avoid the demand to relinquish educational authority; thus, Christianity‚Äôs involvement in education in China entered a new phase.</p>

<li>Wu Zhihui (Wu Zhihui 1924)</li>
</ol>
<p>Wu Zhihui (Âê¥Á®öÊôñ, 1866-1953), a native of Wujin, Jiangsu, joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese Revolutionary Alliance) in France in 1905. In 1912, he founded the Liufa Jianshu Association for students studying in France and served as the chairman of the National Phonetic Conference at the Ministry of Education the following year, promoting the national phonetic system. He strongly advocated for the Kuomintang to purge its ranks and served as a member of the Central Supervisory Commission of the Kuomintang in 1927. In 1946, at the National Assembly for Constitutional Drafting convened by the National Government, Wu served as the chairman of the drafting representatives. In 1947, he was elected as a representative to the National Assembly. The following year, he was elected president of the Academia Sinica and served as an advisor to the Executive Yuan. In 1949, he went to Taiwan, where he passed away in 1953.</p>
<p>As a founder and drafter of the charter of the ‚ÄúNon-Christian Alliance,‚Äù he published an article titled ‚ÄúChristianity at the End of Coercion‚Äù in the August 1924 supplement of the ‚ÄúRepublican Daily,‚Äù which served as his speech at the founding meeting of the ‚ÄúNon-Christian Alliance.‚Äù He cited his personal observations in Britain and France, stating that clergymen were ‚Äúfalse believers‚Äù who used ‚Äúa part of their power‚Äù to obtain influence, and noted that ‚Äúmany people do not attend church,‚Äù with anti-Christian sentiment being considerable in France. ‚ÄúToday, Westerners‚Ä¶ are all extraordinarily diligent in social endeavors, with free thought, unbound by any constraints.‚Äù</p>
<p>With the rise of socialism, ‚Äúeveryone strives to aid the poor, the weak, and all oppressed people based on social realities,‚Äù so ‚Äúrather than relying on God, we must all exert effort to resolve the challenges of life that are not suitable for us.‚ÄùIn the context of China, missionaries who came to China were ‚Äúthose who had exhausted their prospects in their own countries,‚Äù and what they did in China was merely to ‚Äúwin people‚Äôs hearts,‚Äù causing ‚Äúthe general ignorant people in the country‚Äù to ‚Äúpraise the virtues of these imported rogues.‚Äù Thus, ‚Äúwhen will there be a day for China to strive for strength?‚Äù Finally, the article concluded with a personal stance: ‚ÄúI do not oppose Christianity for the sake of opposition; I simply believe it is not applicable to me. I clearly know that there is no God above me, and only in the last twenty years have I fully clarified my thoughts about God. I believe that regardless of the presence of God, if people wish to commit evil, they will still commit evil; as long as we are guided by reason, and all actions align with this standard, what fear do we have of devils haunting us? If China has become a socialist country, there would be no need for us to organize the Non-Christian Alliance. As for the time of great harmony, that need not be said; by then, perhaps we will have already perished, and there will be no need for us to oppose Christianity today, because those religious foreign bigwigs want all our Chinese compatriots to become ‚Äòbones by the river and forever buried in the depths of the mountains and the ocean.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<li>Tang Gongxian (Gongxian 1924)</li>
</ol>
<p>Tang Gongxian (ÂîêÂÖ¨ÊÜ≤, 1898-1938), a native of Suichang, Zhejiang, entered Zhejiang Provincial First Normal School in 1917, where he was influenced by new ideas. In 1921, he embraced communist ideology and joined the Hangzhou Socialist Youth League in 1922. He became one of the earliest party members in Zhejiang in 1923. During the first cooperation between the Nationalist and Communist parties, he joined the Nationalist Party in his personal capacity. In 1925, he was expelled from the Nationalist Party but continued to work as a leftist within it. After the Nationalist Party‚Äôs purge of communists, he was arrested in 1927 and sentenced to twelve years. After being pardoned in 1932, he continued his reform. He passed away in 1938.</p>
<p>In August 1924, when the ‚ÄúNon-Christian Alliance‚Äù was reorganized, Tang served as the chairman of the executive committee. In an article published in October 1924 in the ‚ÄúRepublic Daily‚Äù supplement titled ‚ÄúObserving Christianity from the New Testament‚ÄîAbsolutely No Room for Existence,‚Äù he openly criticized Christianity as a tool used by imperialist powers to invade China. In the article, he stated that Jesus recorded in the New Testament was ‚Äújust a bastard,‚Äù and the concept of virgin birth ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt hold scientifically.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf we believe in ‚Äòvirgin birth,‚Äô then we can say that all illegitimate children in the world are from ‚Äòvirgin birth.‚Äô Those who eat teachings should worship these bastards just as they worship Jesus Christ.‚Äù He further argued that the contents of the New Testament were ‚Äúfabricated lies‚Äù designed to ‚Äúdeceive ignorant people,‚Äù ‚Äúpromote absolute superstition,‚Äù ‚Äúsuppress people‚Äôs freedom,‚Äù ‚Äúcreate chaos in the world,‚Äù and ‚Äúdisrespect women‚Äôs personalities.‚Äù Therefore, his conclusion was: ‚ÄúChristianity is deceitful, worships empty idols, disrupts the world, undervalues women, and is devoid of freedom, equality, and even the meaning of brotherhood; it serves as a lackey for imperialist powers.‚Äù</p>

<li>Li Weihan (Li Weihan 1987: 6-8)</li>
</ol>
<p>Li Weihan (ÊùéÁ∂≠Êº¢, 1896-1984), a native of Changsha, Hunan. In April 1918, he co-founded the New People‚Äôs Society with Mao Zedong and others. In 1919, while studying in France on a work-study program, he embraced Marxism. In 1922, he, along with Zhou Enlai, founded the Youth Communist Party of China in Europe. He returned to China at the end of that year and joined the Chinese Communist Party, becoming an early member, playing an important role in the Chinese communist movement.</p>
<p>In 1924, Li Weihan, then the secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CCP, wrote an article stating that the imperialist policies of aggression against China could be divided into economic, political, and cultural forms.</p>
<p>His explanation for cultural invasion was: ‚ÄúCultural invasion comes from church schools and Christian churches. In a church school, everything is interfered with by outsiders; even during class hours, armed police monitor and prohibit teachers from discussing patriotism or politics. The teachings of the church claim that bodily pleasures are inconsequential, and after death, souls enjoy equality and happiness in heaven. This tells the Chinese people to remain perpetual slaves to outsiders and to never rebel. It also claims to love enemies as if they were brothers, but our common enemy is the outsiders; must we love them as brothers?! Moreover, China often provides opportunities for outsiders to use missionary work to anesthetize the Chinese people; even relief organizations are run by foreigners. Thus, when foreign teachings gain the people‚Äôs beliefs, they infiltrate the masses. Most Chinese educators are students who studied in the United States, while the US now restricts this by only allowing Chinese students to enter church schools‚Äîthis is not very dangerous information?!‚Äù</p>
<p>After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, he served as the first minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee.(5) Yun Daiying (ÊÉ≤‰ª£Ëã± 1984a: 371-373; 1984b: 393-396; 1984c: 814-822; 1984d: 823-829; ÈüìÂáåËªí 1988: 258-261)</p>
<p>Yun Daiying (ÊÉ≤‰ª£Ëã±, 1895-1931), hailing from Wuchang, Hubei. During his early years of study in Wuchang, he was exposed to the Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA). Although he appreciated certain aspects, he ultimately refused to become a Christian. In 1919, he joined the Young China Association and the following year organized the Chinese Socialist Youth League. He later joined the Chinese Communist Party and became one of its early members. During the first cooperation between the Nationalist and Communist parties, he joined the Nationalist Party. In 1926, he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Nationalist Party and served as a political instructor at the Huangpu Military Academy. After the split between the Nationalist and Communist parties, he participated in the uprisings in Nanchang and Guangzhou. He was arrested in Shanghai in 1930 and executed by firing squad in Nanjing in April 1931.</p>
<p>In 1923, Yun Daiying published articles in ‚ÄúChina Youth‚Äù in November and December opposing Christianity. The first article countered the YMCA‚Äôs notion of ‚Äúpersonality saving the nation,‚Äù questioning ‚Äúwho has ruined China with an absence of personality?‚Äù One culprit pointed out was ‚Äúthe benefactors of the YMCA, the British and Americans.‚Äù These ‚Äúconsumers of Christianity,‚Äù ‚Äúrely on the protection of foreign capitalists,‚Äù and when they say, ‚Äúpersonality saves the nation,‚Äù it sounds all too grand! In the second article, he listed various reasons against Christianity: (1) Religion hinders human evolution; (2) The educational, social, and medical missions of Christianity aim to ‚Äúdeceive people into becoming their followers‚Äù; (3) The YMCA only promotes ‚ÄúWestern happiness,‚Äù having no connection to society; (4) The content of Christianity seeks to overthrow China‚Äôs old belief in superstition; (5) Believers are all ‚Äúforeign slaves,‚Äù ‚Äúevery additional Christian means another foreign slave‚Äù; (6) Christianity colludes with foreign powers; (7) Christianity exhibits an exclusivist nature; (8) Jesus himself is a ‚Äúcitizen of a fallen nation,‚Äù so how can it be said that ‚ÄúJesus‚Äô teachings can save China‚Äù? (9) Christianity is ‚Äúa tool of foreigners to soften China‚Äù; (10) Christians enjoy protection under extraterritoriality.</p>
<p>In May 1926, he delivered a speech titled ‚ÄúJesus, Confucius, and Revolutionary Youth‚Äù at Lingnan University, a time when the Non-Christian Movement was taking place. In his speech, he praised many teachers and students at Lingnan as comrades in anti-imperialism, expressing his pleasure to speak at ‚Äúthis university sympathetic to anti-imperialism.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the speech, Yun Daiying plainly criticized Jesus, asserting that Jesus was a ‚Äúsage‚Äù surpassing Confucius, because while Confucius ‚Äúonly preached persuasion,‚Äù Jesus possessed a ‚Äúrevolutionary spirit,‚Äù ‚Äúsimilar to our revolutionary party today, closely spreading awareness to the masses,‚Äù even reproaching oppressors. However, neither Confucius‚Äô ‚Äúpersuasion‚Äù nor Jesus‚Äô ‚Äúrebuke‚Äù could save the world; only revolution, ‚Äúthe act of striking,‚Äù could. Moreover, today, Jesus‚Äô disciples, faced with Jesus‚Äô rebuke, met their deaths. Ultimately, they ‚Äúlearn the teachings of Jesus‚Äù but do not have the ‚Äúcourage‚Äù to oppose imperialism as Jesus did.</p>
<p>Yun Daiying acknowledged that there were many good people within the church, ‚Äúwho can neither stop the acts of violence by imperialism and warlords‚Ä¶ nor dare to advocate for Chinese civilians to resist imperialism or warlords‚Äô revolutionary actions.‚Äù Instead, they ‚Äúcling to the teachings of peace and submission‚Äù and ‚Äúpropagate doctrines of peace and tolerance.‚Äù Therefore, his opposition to Christianity stemmed from the fact that many good Christian people not only ‚Äúdo not engage in revolution‚Äù but also ‚Äúadvocate against revolution,‚Äù even ‚Äúenticing many to stray from the path of overthrowing imperialism and warlords.‚Äù In his writings, Yun did not shy away from advocating the abolition of foreign-run schools, arguing that ‚Äúforeign teachers love their own countries.‚Äù In establishing schools in China, they ‚Äúmay seek happiness for us Chinese, however, they also absolutely do not wish for the Chinese students they educate to oppose their home countries,‚Äù and they ‚Äúdo not desire goodwill from us towards their imperialist governments.‚Äù In these schools, only the imperialists‚Äô government is presented as being ‚Äúgood‚Äù to us while hiding their own wrongdoings. Once a student rises to rebel, ‚Äúthey support their imperialist government in oppressing our students.‚Äù Thus, he stated: ‚ÄúFor every Chinese youth who enters a school run by the British, a person who opposes British imperialism is lost‚Ä¶ the more developed foreign-run schools become, the fewer there will be who oppose imperialism.‚Äù In his speech, he called on all Lingnan University students to become ‚Äúcomrades in anti-imperialism.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven though educated by American teachers, we must still firmly oppose American imperialism.‚Äù At the same time, he urged Lingnan to abolish Bible classes and worship, as compelling students to study the Bible and participate in prayer services violated their freedom of belief.‚ÄùDo not let these mythical superstitions disturb the minds of our youth, wasting their time and spirit.‚Äù In contrast, Chinese youth ‚Äúmust engage in revolution.‚Äù He further sarcastically questioned whether Christianity could change the world, stating, ‚ÄúChristian believers have prayed for over two thousand years, yet we see no improvement in the world; instead, they have prayed forth so many imperialists and warlords.‚Äù</p>
<p>In June 1926, Yun Daiying published an article titled ‚ÄúAgainst the Cultural Invasion of Imperialism‚Äù in ‚ÄúGuangdong Youth,‚Äù providing a detailed analysis of cultural invasion. He categorized the cultural policies used by imperialists to ‚Äúsoften and subdue weak nations‚Äù as part of ‚Äúcultural invasion,‚Äù which included proselytizing, church schools, accepting international students, publishing, and public speaking. Through these avenues, imperialists conveyed four types of ideas: (1) Propagating superstitions about God, Jesus, heaven, and hell, which distracts weak nations from their immediate sufferings and leads them to hope for future happiness in the vague and insubstantial; (2) Praising the civilization of imperialist countries while concealing their societal evils, causing weak nations to be dazzled and confused by these claims, willingly submitting and acknowledging imperialist countries as centers of civilization; (3) Promoting a one-sided doctrine of peace and brotherhood, while failing to point out or oppose the crimes of imperialism against weak nations. Thus, their so-called peace and brotherhood merely help imperialists ensure that weak nations do not resist their oppression; (4) Celebrating the alleged virtues of imperialists towards weak nations while failing to mention the oppression imposed by imperialists, instead highlighting a few matters that superficially appear beneficial to weak nations, thereby invoking gratitude and ensuring that weak nations remain passive subjects.</p>
<p>Yun Daiying pointed out that there are 8,000 foreign missionaries dispersed throughout China, establishing churches and recruiting congregants, with more than 300,000 communion members nationwide. Additionally, there are over 40 YMCA locations in various cities, boasting around 8,000 members. Churches have established over 2,000 primary and secondary schools, with a total of 100,000 students. All of these are ‚Äúnurtured and deceived directly or indirectly by imperialism, entirely unaware or unwilling to resist imperialism.‚Äù Anglo-American imperialists are actively expanding church operations and are using the Boxer Indemnity as funding for cultural invasion, fundamentally destroying the spirit and movements of the Chinese nation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to oppose this ‚Äúcultural invasion.‚Äù In conclusion, he called for ‚ÄúChristian churches and church schools to immediately sever their ties with imperialism,‚Äù ‚Äúoppose imperialists operating any cultural enterprises in China,‚Äù and urged ‚ÄúChristian believers and church students to rise and join the anti-cultural invasion movement.‚Äù</p>

<li>Zhang Zhenzhi/Zhang Zhenzhen (Zhang Zhenzhen 1929: 1-110)</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhang Zhenzhi (pen name Zhenzhen, dates of birth and death unknown), a member of the Kuomintang, worked at the Central Party Headquarters. He authored several works, including ‚ÄúThe Pathology of Contemporary Chinese Society‚Äù (1929), ‚ÄúThe Trinity of Party, Government, and People‚Äù (1929), ‚ÄúOn the Ease of Knowing and Acting,‚Äù ‚ÄúRevolution and Religion‚Äù (1929), and ‚ÄúA Critique of Hu Shi‚Äôs Anti-Party Report‚Äù (1930). Among these, ‚ÄúRevolution and Religion‚Äù compiled his critical articles on religion, particularly Christianity. As he stated in the ‚ÄúForeword‚Äù: ‚ÄúThe purpose of this book is to clarify the distinctions between religious thought and revolutionary thought. It raises the question of whether revolutionary thought can tolerate the existence of religious thought; that is, whether revolution involves overthrowing religion.‚Äù In response to this issue, he clearly concluded: ‚ÄúI affirm that under revolutionary thought, there can be no room for strong religious ideas; any resurgence and widespread propagation of religious thought must be condemned.‚Äù</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts, the first being ‚ÄúDiscussion on the Issue of Christianity,‚Äù which critiques Christianity and includes a debate between him and Christian Zhang Shizhang in the supplement to the ‚ÄúRepublic Daily.‚Äù The second part is ‚ÄúFolklore Conversations,‚Äù primarily critiquing folk religions and beliefs.</p>
<p>In Zhang Zhenzhi‚Äôs view, the sins of Christianity in China include: (1) Serving as a protective cover for the economic and military aggression of imperialists; (2) Encompassing congregants such that their properties gradually become church property; (3) Involving pastors and priests in political interference in the interior, with no Chinese or Western officials daring to take action; (4) Using believers to oppress non-believing citizens. Thus, he believes that ‚Äúoverthrowing Christianity‚Äù is justifiable. He even advocated for the confiscation of all church institutions for use as labor schools. He also rejected the principle of ‚Äúfreedom of belief,‚Äù positing that belief itself is ‚Äúsuperstition‚Äù; under ‚Äúsuperstitious belief,‚Äù freedoms are non-existent. Therefore, ‚Äúa person has freedom only when they do not believe; once they believe, their freedom is taken away by the religion.‚Äù As a member of the Kuomintang, he further opposed ‚Äúcooperation between the party and religion.‚ÄùBecause the Kuomintang could not collaborate with Christianity that is related to imperialism. As a revolutionary party, the Kuomintang only believed in one ideology and worshiped the party leaders; ‚Äúthere is only the freedom of the party, not the freedom of the individual.‚Äù Thus, both the party and the religion are ‚Äúunique,‚Äù and religion stands in opposition to the party, which necessitates its overthrow.</p>

<li>Shanghai ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Student Federation,‚Äù 1922 (Zhang Qinshi 1928: 187-190; Lutz 1988: 59-60)</li>
</ol>
<p>In response to the World Student Christian Federation convening its 11th annual meeting in Beijing in April 1922, an organization called the ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Student Federation‚Äù was established in Shanghai in March. On March 9, the federation sent a telegram to ‚Äústudents of Tsinghua School in Beijing and students from all schools across the country,‚Äù indicating that the concept of the separation of church and state, as well as the separation of education and religion, has been popular in Europe since the Renaissance. However, since modern times, Christianity has become the ‚Äúvanguard of colonialism,‚Äù with ‚Äúthe gospel enslaving us spiritually.‚Äù Facing the threat of ‚ÄúChristianization and capitalization,‚Äù the World Student Christian Federation gathered in ‚Äúthe capital of our weak nation,‚Äù hence appealing to ‚Äúyou all, to express your opinions and jointly denounce oppression, with the aim of ensuring the purity of our youth‚Äôs educational sphere.‚Äù</p>
<p>On the same day, the Shanghai ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Student Federation‚Äù issued a declaration denouncing Christianity and the church as roots of many historical evils. Modern Christianity and the church are further identified as a demon that aids the ‚Äúbourgeoisie‚Äù in plundering and oppressing the ‚Äúproletariat,‚Äù thus becoming part of ‚Äúa brutal, oppressive, and miserable capitalist society,‚Äù a ‚Äúdemon that aids the tyranny.‚Äù The declaration pointed out that churches established by various countries in China aimed to ‚Äútempt the Chinese people into welcoming capitalism‚Äù and ‚Äúto cultivate the good dogs of capitalists.‚Äù Therefore, while opposing capitalism, the Chinese people must also oppose ‚Äúthis modern Christianity and church that supports capitalism and deceives the common people.‚Äù</p>
<p>The declaration concluded that the ‚ÄúWorld Student Christian Federation‚Äù is also a product of modern Christianity and the church, and its annual meeting is a ‚Äúrobbery conference that humiliates our youth, deceives our people, and plunders our economy.‚Äù Hence, it was decided to ‚Äúdeclare war‚Äù on it.</p>
<p>In the 4th issue of ‚ÄúPioneer‚Äù published on March 15, 1922, there was ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Student Federation Announcement.‚Äù This was the official publication of the Chinese Socialist Youth League, containing: ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Student Federation Declaration, Telegram, Constitution,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristianity and World Transformation‚Äù (Chi Guang), ‚ÄúChristianity and Capitalism‚Äù (Lu Shu), ‚ÄúChristianity and Communism‚Äù (Qi Yuan), and ‚ÄúChristianity and Women‚Äù (Zhe Hua), among other articles.</p>
<p>In April 1922, the Anti-Christian Student Federation became a permanent organization, simultaneously soliciting more members under both the names of ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Student Federation‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Federation.‚Äù On April 20, a notice titled ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Federation Seeks Comrades‚Äù was published in the supplementary section ‚ÄúAwakening‚Äù of Shanghai‚Äôs ‚ÄúRepublic Daily,‚Äù indicating that invading powers exploit Christianity to ‚Äúenslave the spirit of colonized and invaded nations.‚Äù</p>

</ol>
<p>Following the Shanghai Anti-Christian Student Federation, the ‚ÄúAnti-Religion Federation‚Äù was established in Beijing. On March 21, 1922, Li Shizeng, Xiao Zisheng, Li Dazhao, Miao Boying, and 79 others co-signed and sent a telegram to newspaper offices, schools, organizations across the country, and the Chinese people, stating that ‚Äúthe poison of religion is rampant‚Ä¶heretical teachings are widespread,‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe world Christian students‚Äù are about to ‚Äúpropagate superstition‚Äù in the capital. Therefore, they organized the ‚ÄúAnti-Religion Federation,‚Äù aiming for ‚Äúthe spirit of science to shine forth with evolution.‚Äù On April 1, a second telegram was issued, reiterating that the federation is not ‚Äúexclusive,‚Äù but merely ‚Äúnon-religious‚Äù in the sense of ‚Äúscience defeating religion.‚Äù</p>
<p>In its declaration, it clearly stated that religion and scientific truth are incompatible and completely contrary to humanitarianism, thus ‚Äúreligion and humanity cannot coexist.‚Äù Although positioning itself as ‚Äúnon-religious,‚Äù it specifically targeted Christianity, stating that it incites youth through youth associations, and various activities are simply ‚Äúpoisonous anesthetics and hypnotism.‚Äù It welcomed ‚Äúall who are not superstitious of religion, or wish to eliminate the harm of religion‚Äù to become comrades of the Anti-Religion Federation.</p>

<li>Shanghai ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Federation,‚Äù 1924 (Zhang Qinshi 1928: 376-380; 293-315)</li>
</ol>
<p>In August 1924, the ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Federation‚Äù was reorganized, with Tang Gongxian (Chinese Communist Party) serving as chairman, and Wu Zhihui (Kuomintang) drafting the constitution. Among the five executive members, three were members of the Communist Party (Tang, Ke Bianian, Zhang Qiuren).</p>
<p>On August 19, the declaration and constitution of the Anti-Christian Federation were published in the ‚ÄúAwakening‚Äù supplement of the ‚ÄúRepublic Daily.‚Äù The declaration began by outlining the reasons for ‚Äúopposing Christianity,‚Äù including both ‚Äúgeneral meanings‚Äù and ‚Äúspecific meanings.‚ÄùIn the ‚Äúgeneral sense,‚Äù opposing Christianity is similar to opposing other religions, primarily targeting the ‚Äúsuperstition‚Äù inherent in religions, which ‚Äúcalls for a false concept of happiness,‚Äù as the happiness hoped for lies in the future, thus ‚Äúdisregarding the material struggles of the present world and believing that such struggles are futile.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll religions have these same evils, and Christianity, with its particularly powerful organization, is notably harmful, thus we should especially oppose Christianity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Moreover, opposing Christianity has its ‚Äúspecific meaning,‚Äù as Christianity has been used as a tool by the ‚Äúprivileged class‚Äù both in the ‚Äúfeudal era‚Äù and the ‚Äúcapitalist era.‚Äù Particularly in the capitalist era, it has anesthetized the working class in our country, leading them to believe that social wealth disparity is ‚Äúordained by divine will,‚Äù and thus ‚Äúclass struggle‚Äù would violate divine will; or it has ‚Äúanesthetized the populations of conquered colonies and semi-colonies,‚Äù leading them to believe that the military forces in the colonies come ‚Äúto deliver God‚Äôs blessings and to offer education and all culture,‚Äù consequently ‚Äúnot thinking of resistance.‚Äù This is precisely ‚Äúthe greatest reason why we, the Chinese people, must specifically oppose Christianity.‚Äù Missionaries coming to China, whether ‚Äúpreaching or educating,‚Äù intentionally or unintentionally ‚Äúpropagandize their international capitalist worldview, which undermines China‚Äôs national consciousness and patriotism.‚Äù</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the Anti-Christian Federation in 1924, activities opposing Christianity were planned more systematically, including the publication of materials and organizing lectures, as well as conducting research on Christianity and its enterprises. The Kuomintang‚Äôs publication ‚ÄúRepublic Daily‚Äù featured a supplementary section ‚ÄúAwakening,‚Äù which regularly published ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Special Issues‚Äù as the official publication of the Anti-Christian Federation. For example, the ‚ÄúEditorial‚Äù in January 1925, titled ‚ÄúAn Unprecedented Anti-Christian Movement,‚Äù stated that ‚Äúunless imperialism is fundamentally overthrown, the power of Christianity cannot be fundamentally eradicated. If we genuinely want to oppose Christianity, we must strive to oppose the imperialism movement.‚Äù ‚ÄúOpposing Christianity is also a method of opposing imperialism‚Äîan indirect method of opposition; at the same time, it can reduce the power of imperialism and expose the evils of imperialism.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe hope that our compatriots, unwilling to submit to the forces of imperialism and Christianity, will make extra efforts in the anti-Christian movement, making this Christmas a festival of the anti-Christian movement.‚Äù Similarly, publications from the Communist Party (such as ‚ÄúThe Guide,‚Äù ‚ÄúChinese Youth‚Äù) also published numerous articles criticizing Christianity.</p>

<li>Anti-Christian Movement, 1922-1927 (Lutz 1988; Yang Tianhong 1994: 122-220, 327-422; Xing Fuzeng 1994: 135-136)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the 1920s, the significant impact faced by Christianity in China was undoubtedly the ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Movement‚Äù (1922-1927). ‚ÄúAnti-Christian‚Äù means opposition to Christianity; however, in this context, ‚Äúopposition‚Äù or ‚Äúanti‚Äù does not merely refer to general doubts or objections to Christian beliefs, but to a mass movement mobilizing against Christianity through propaganda and even violent means. The organizers of this movement were political parties and their peripheral groups, and their accusations against Christianity had a strong ideological struggle with ‚Äúanti-imperialism.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Anti-Christian Movement can be divided into two phases. The first phase erupted in April 1922 in response to the World Student Christian Federation‚Äôs annual meeting held in Beijing. The Anti-Christian Student Federation and the Anti-Religion Federation were established successively in Shanghai and Beijing, and then spread to other cities (including Beijing, Wuhu, Taiyuan, Baoding, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Tangshan, Nanchang, Xiamen, Wuchang, Guangzhou, Changsha, etc.), establishing various Anti-Christian Student Federations or Anti-Religion Federations between March and April. Some scholars, based on Soviet archives, have pointed out that the Anti-Christian Movement in 1922 was not a spontaneous movement, but was initiated and led by the Chinese Communist Party under the direct guidance of the Soviet Communist Party, the Far East Bureau of the Communist International, and the Youth International, with members from the Kuomintang participating in this political struggle (Tao Feiya 2003a: 122).</p>
<p>The focus of the first phase of the Anti-Christian Movement was directed towards the annual meeting of the World Student Christian Federation. Although the struggle also targeted Christianity, the Shanghai Anti-Christian Student Federation renamed itself to Anti-Christian Federation in April. However, as the annual meeting concluded, the targets of the struggle or opposition were lost, affecting the movement‚Äôs mobilization capacity.</p>
<p>In 1924, the Shanghai ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Federation‚Äù was reorganized, marking the beginning of the second phase of the Anti-Christian Movement. This phase was closely related to the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In January 1924, the Kuomintang held its first national congress in Guangzhou, where Sun Yat-sen proposed the three major policies of ‚Äúunite with Russia, unite with the communists, and support the peasants and workers,‚Äù allowing Communist Party members to join the Kuomintang in their individual capacity. The ‚ÄúDeclaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang‚Äù clearly pointed out that imperialism and warlords were the roots of China‚Äôs turmoil, stating that only by opposing imperialism could China achieve national freedom and independence. As a result, both parties actively engaged in leading anti-imperial struggles throughout the country, under the anti-imperialist demands, ‚Äúanti-Christian‚Äù became a target of the ‚Äúanti-imperialist‚Äù struggle. The ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Federation‚Äù became an important platform for the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation against imperialism, and both parties used their respective propaganda publications (such as the Kuomintang‚Äôs ‚ÄúRepublic Daily‚Äù and the Communist Party‚Äôs ‚ÄúChinese Youth,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Guide‚Äù) to publish numerous articles accusing Christianity of being a tool of imperialism in China. At this time, ‚Äúcultural invasion‚Äù became a significant discourse in the Communist Party‚Äôs critique of Christianity (Tao Feiya 2003b).</p>
<p>In December 1924, the Anti-Christian Federation called for the establishment of Anti-Christian Federations across various regions and designated the week before and after Christmas as ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Movement Week,‚Äù mobilizing crowds for parades, distributing Anti-Christian leaflets and publications, and holding Anti-Christian meetings. As a result, areas such as Changsha, Guangzhou, Suzhou, Jiujiang, Shanghai, Shandong, Shaoxing, Taiyuan, Ningbo, and Qingdao responded. In January 1925, an editorial in the ‚ÄúAwakening‚Äù section of the ‚ÄúRepublic Daily‚Äù reiterated that ‚Äúopposing Christianity is also a way to oppose imperialism‚Ä¶it can extinguish the power of imperialism and expose its evils‚Äù (Chen Tong 1925).</p>
<p>In 1925, following the ‚ÄúMay Thirtieth Incident,‚Äù the national anti-imperial sentiment peaked, leading to strikes, boycotts, and class walkouts across various regions, and the anti-Christian mass movement also leaned towards violence. In 1926, as the National Revolutionary Army launched its Northern Expedition, the areas reached by the Northern Expedition Army also stimulated mass movements, with churches, schools, and hospitals being impacted, and even occupied by the Northern Expedition Army. In the context of a severe political situation, missionaries began to evacuate from various locations.</p>
<p>By 1927, a new situation arose in China. On one hand, the National Government was established, with Nanjing as its capital. On the other hand, the Kuomintang carried out a party purge, leading to the breakdown of the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. At this time, the Kuomintang had become the ruling party of the unified regime, publicly affirming religious freedom while opposing anti-religious events characterized by mass movements. For instance, in 1927, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang passed an order stating that ‚Äúthe public should not misunderstand the fall of imperialism as a justification for an anti-foreign and anti-religious nature, nor should any force be used to oppress or infringe upon the freedom of faith of Chinese and foreign people.‚Äù Against this backdrop, the originally initiated Anti-Christian Movement by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was on the verge of conclusion.However, within the Kuomintang, there remained a strong anti-Christian sentiment. This form of ‚Äúopposition‚Äù no longer took place through mobilizing mass movements but operated on an ideological level. After 1927, many Kuomintang members continued to oppose Christianity in their personal or party capacities, harboring animosity towards believers under the pretext of religious sentiments. In December 1928, the Kuomintang‚Äôs publication ‚ÄúRepublic Daily‚Äù still released an ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Special Issue.‚Äù In January 1929, it further issued a substantial study on unequal treaties, exceeding a hundred pages, detailing how Christianity conducted cultural invasion using extensive textual explanations and various charts.</p>

<li>Educational Rights Movement, 1922-1927 (Yang Tianhong 1994: 241-276; Yang Cuihua 1984: 235-289; Lutz 1988: 91-159)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Educational Rights Movement was an important aspect of the Anti-Christian Movement and ultimately implemented through government regulations. Its primary focus targeted the educational enterprises established by Christianity in China.</p>
<p>According to the ‚ÄúChristian Education in China: The Report of the China Education Commission of 1921-1922‚Äù published in 1922, there were 6,890 church-run primary and secondary schools across the country, with a total of 199,604 students. If various types of Christian educational institutions (such as Bible schools, seminaries, special education, orphanages, nurse training, etc.) are included, there were a total of 7,382 Christian educational institutions, serving 214,254 students. At that time, the total number of students at all levels nationwide was 5,700,000. The number of students enrolled in Christian educational institutions accounted for only 3.76% of the total student population. However, in higher education, students attending Christian universities (2,017) constituted 7.9% of students in national universities (25,373) (China Education Commission 1922: 371-374).</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Republic, the issue of Christian-run education began to attract the attention of Chinese intellectuals. Many educators (such as Cai Yuanpei) advocated for the separation of religion from education, especially criticizing the religious courses and activities in church schools. The proselytization to minors was particularly condemned by educational scholars. Amid the wave of nationalism in the 1920s, students, driven by patriotic feelings, participated in student movements, and church schools were no exception. However, the missionaries leading the church schools took a high-handed approach to prohibit such activities, creating conflicts and opposition between students and the school authorities. During this period, some students began to protest against ‚Äúenslavement‚Äù education. Consequently, church schools found themselves at odds with Chinese nationalism.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the intellectual community further proposed recommendations regarding the relationship between religion and education in China. In December 1921, the China Educational Improvement Society was established, with board members including Cai Yuanpei, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Boling. At their annual meeting in July of the following year, Hu Shi suggested that ‚Äúno religious education (including theory and rituals) should be present in any primary school (including kindergartens),‚Äù which was supported by Tao Menghe and Ding Wenjiang. After the meeting, the China Educational Improvement Society officially communicated its position to various church schools and religious group schools. In July 1924, at the third annual meeting of the China Educational Improvement Society, a proposal was made to reclaim educational rights: ‚ÄúRequest to strive for the recovery of educational rights,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo person without citizenship of the Republic of China shall conduct national education on the territory of the Republic of China,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRequest to prohibit foreigners from establishing schools in China.‚Äù The amendments to the final three proposals were approved, primarily requesting the government to formulate strict school registration regulations, stipulating that ‚Äúany foreigner using schools to carry out aggression, upon thorough investigation, should have their operations ordered to cease by the government.‚Äù</p>
<p>In October 1924, the tenth annual meeting of the National Education Union was held, passing proposals related to reclaiming educational rights. In 1925, the publication ‚ÄúChinese Educational Circle‚Äù released a special issue on the ‚ÄúEducational Rights Movement,‚Äù reaffirming that education is a matter of national sovereignty. However, due to the warlord divisions in China at that time, the lack of a unified national government meant that the recommendations made by educational organizations to the government lacked a realistic basis for implementation.</p>
<p>In February 1926, the Guangzhou National Government established an Educational Administrative Committee, with Xu Chongqing, a supporter of reclaiming educational rights, in charge. In June, a draft policy separating religion and education was published.In October, regulations such as the ‚ÄúRegulations for Private Schools,‚Äù ‚ÄúRegulations for the Establishment of Boards of Private Schools,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSchool Registration Regulations‚Äù were issued, requiring church schools to register and prohibiting them from offering religious courses or forcing students to participate in religious activities. In July, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang began the Northern Expedition. As the National Revolutionary Army advanced, various local warlord regimes successively changed banners. By April 1927, the National Government was established with Nanjing as its capital. The Northern Expedition concluded the following year, leading to a unified government in China. The Nanjing National Government established a ‚ÄúUniversity College,‚Äù with Cai Yuanpei as its president. Based on the foundation of a unified government, the demand for the reclamation of educational rights was finally realized. Christian education was incorporated into the Chinese educational system, requiring all church schools to register with the government. School principals had to be Chinese nationals, and the board of directors had to consist of more than half Chinese members, with foreigners prohibited from being board chairpersons. Religious courses could not be classified as required subjects, and students could not be compelled to participate in religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>By 1931, except for St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University, West China Union University, and South China Women‚Äôs College of Arts and Sciences, the other ten Christian universities had registered with the Chinese government. At the primary and secondary school levels, by around 1929, approximately 70% of church schools had completed or were in the process of registering.</p>

<li>The Evacuation, 1927 (Boynton 1928: 155-159; Zhang Junjun 1928: 1-6; Jiang Diao Zhi 1928: 6-10)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1924, the number of missionaries in China reached a historical peak of 7,663. However, during 1927, nearly 3,000 missionaries left China (including those on leave in 1928 and some who returned early in 1929), resulting in a sharp decline in the number of missionaries to 3,113. The primary reason for the withdrawal of missionaries was the instability of the political situation in China. In July 1926, Chiang Kai-shek was appointed commander of the National Revolutionary Army and issued the mobilization order for the Northern Expedition, launching an offensive from Guangdong. Within six months, he defeated the two major warlords, Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang, expanding the National Government‚Äôs control from Guangdong to the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian. In January 1927, the Northern Expedition Army forcibly took over the British concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang, prompting foreign nationals across various locations along the Yangtze River to retreat to Shanghai. In March, Shanghai and Nanjing fell into the hands of the revolutionary army. After entering Nanjing, on March 24, radicals attacked British, American, and Japanese consulates and foreign churches, schools, hospitals, and shops, resulting in the tragic deaths of some missionaries in what became known as the ‚ÄúNanjing Incident.‚Äù</p>
<p>In provinces reached by the Northern Expedition Army, missionaries retreated to nearby provinces to observe the situation. Following the recovery of the British concession in Hankou, more missionaries withdrew. Simultaneously, various regions experienced anti-Christian mass movements. For instance, in Christmas 1926, Hunan hosted an ‚ÄúAnti-Christian Week,‚Äù featuring marches and speeches, with attacks on churches, and missionaries being paraded and bound in public, along with churches, church schools, hospitals, and youth associations being occupied. Under these circumstances, missionaries evacuated from Hunan province, leaving only about 30 to 40 behind. Most churches and schools in Changsha, Xiangtan, Hengzhou, and Yuezhou were closed. Zhang Junjun of the Hunan Zhendao Association described the impact faced by Hunan churches as ‚Äúa stormy and rapid downpour.‚Äù Furthermore, due to the Nanjing Incident, local churches faced even more severe impacts, with most churches in the city occupied by revolutionary forces, and churches and schools being looted. The Nanjing Christian Association noted, ‚ÄúThe behavior against churches by the revolutionary army upon entering the city resembled a storm and torrential rain, a terrifying wave sweeping through and overwhelming the land, comparable to the disasters of the Boxer Uprising.‚Äù</p>
<p>C. L. Boynton pointed out that the reasons for the missionaries‚Äô departure included: (1) being advised by Chinese colleagues to leave; (2) receiving immediate evacuation orders from consuls; (3) concerns about creating more international disputes if they stayed; and (4) being ordered to evacuate by churches or mission societies.</p>
<p>As the situation stabilized, missionaries began to return to their fields. Of the more than 3,000 who left China in 1927, by 1928, approximately 500 to 1,000 returned. By the eve of the War of Resistance, the number had risen again to 6,020.</p>
