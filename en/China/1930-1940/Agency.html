<li>Chia Yu Ming (Jia Yuming), 1880-1964 (Wang Delong 2017; Zha Shijie 1983b: 113-120; Guo Weilian 2002: 55-60)</li>
</ol>
<p>Chia Yu Ming, courtesy name Dexin, self-styled as Xingwu, was from ChangLe County, Shandong, and was a third-generation Christian, baptized from a young age. He studied at the Dengzhou Literary Society, founded by American Presbyterian missionary Calvin Mateer. During his studies, he resolved to dedicate his life to preaching. After graduating from the Literary Society in 1901, he graduated from the Theological Seminary in 1904 and worked as a preacher in Anqiu, Weifang.</p>
<p>Chia was ordained as a pastor in 1907 and transferred to serve the Presbyterian Church in Yizhou, Shandong, in 1908. During this time, he actively participated in the church unification movement, including the Shandong Christian Federation and the National Presbyterian Alliance. In 1916, he became a professor at Jinling Theological Seminary, which was co-sponsored by the Southern Presbyterian Church, Northern Presbyterian Church, Disciples of Christ, Methodist Episcopal Church (South), and Methodist Episcopal Church (North), reflecting Chia‚Äôs commitment to unity. Later, when the Presbyterian Church discussed joining the Chinese Christian Church, Chia was involved. While in Nanjing, he founded the ‚ÄúLingguang Daily,‚Äù promoting the motto ‚ÄúUphold the truth, develop the spiritual life and knowledge of believers.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, as the conflict between old and new theology emerged, the unification movement faced challenges. Fundamentalist individuals, aiming to maintain the purity of their faith, refused to cooperate with modernists and even withdrew from united or cooperative organizations. At that time, a conservative faction of Presbyterians refused to participate in the Chinese Christian Church, of which Chia was a part. In 1922, he criticized the new theology for undermining unity and called on steadfast believers to be a bulwark of truth. That same year, Chia left Jinling Theological Seminary, accepting an invitation from Watson M. Hayes to teach at the North China Theological Seminary in Teng County, Shandong, reflecting his stance.</p>
<p>In 1929, members of the North China Presbyterian Assembly initiated the formation of the ‚ÄúLeague of Christian Churches,‚Äù and a conference was held in December of that year, collectively deciding not to join the Chinese Christian Church formed by the Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and London Missionary Society, and through the establishment of the League of Christian Churches. Chia actively participated and served as an editorial committee member for the league‚Äôs publication ‚ÄúMorning Light.‚Äù In 1935, he was elected president of the league again.</p>
<p>In 1930, Chia was invited to serve as the president of Jinling Women‚Äôs Theological Seminary. In addition to teaching, he was frequently invited to lead various gatherings in churches across the nation. In 1936, Jinling Women‚Äôs Theological Seminary merged with Jinling Theological Seminary, and Chia resigned from his position to focus on preparing for the ‚ÄúChina Christian Spirituality Institute.‚Äù In October of the same year, the institute officially opened in Nanjing at Daihou Alley, with its charter stating unequivocally: ‚ÄúThe school‚Äôs sacred work relies on the Lord; no fundraising, no borrowing, living by faith.‚Äù Its mission was to train preachers dedicated to living by faith.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Nanjing fell, forcing the closure of the spirituality institute. Chia relocated with the government, re-establishing the spirituality institute in Guanyin County, Sichuan, in 1939, moving to Chengdu the following year, and eventually relocating to Huangjiao Ya in Nanshan, Chongqing, in 1941. After the victory in the War of Resistance, he handed the Sichuan Spirituality Institute over to the West China Spiritual Work Team and returned to Nanjing to establish the China Christian Nanjing Spirituality Institute. In 1949, he moved to Shaanxi Road in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In 1948, Chia was invited to attend the World Evangelical Conference in the Netherlands, where he was elected vice president of the International Council of Christian Churches. On his way back to China via Singapore, many urged him to stay in Southeast Asia, but he felt that the Chinese Church needed him more and resolutely returned to the Shanghai Spirituality Institute to continue his work. In 1949, at the age of 70, Chia continued to lead the spirituality institute while also being invited to lead spiritual conferences and evangelistic revivals in Guangxi‚Äôs Guilin, Shaanxi‚Äôs Xi‚Äôan, Sanyuan, Beijing, Tianjin, and other regions during the summer of that year.</p>
<p>In September 1950, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement was initiated, and Chia initially refused to participate in the signature campaign. In April 1951, his name appeared on the list of representatives attending a conference in Beijing, but he was represented by Sun Meizhi, reflecting his desire to participate in a more passive manner. However, amidst subsequent accusations, Chia could no longer remain uninvolved. In 1951, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù published an article by Chia Yu Ming titled ‚ÄúIs the Christian an Apolitical Being from a Biblical Perspective?‚Äù(1) Chia Yu Ming and the Development of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement</p>
<p>Chia Yu Ming (Ë≥àÁéâÈäò) published articles such as ‚ÄúÊé®ËøõÂü∫Áù£Êïô‰∏âËá™Èù©Êñ∞ËøêÂä®ÔºåÂàáÊñ≠‰∏éÁæéÂ∏ùÂõΩ‰∏ª‰πâÁöÑ‰∏ÄÂàáÂÖ≥Á≥ª‚Äù (‚ÄúPromoting the Three-Self Reform Movement of Christianity and Severing All Ties with American Imperialism‚Äù). In July 1954, the National Conference of Chinese Christianity was held in Beijing, and Chia was elected as one of the 34 members of the presidium.</p>
<p>In 1954, the ‚ÄúThree-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Chinese Christianity‚Äù was established, with Wu Yaozong as chairman. The meeting emphasized ‚Äúgreat unity,‚Äù with Chia Yu Ming becoming one of the six vice-chairmen, although he did not attend, and was represented by Yang Shaotang. Because Chia wished to participate in the Three-Self movement, his Shanghai Spirituality Institute was spared from merging. In 1956, the Shanghai Spirituality Institute merged with the Chinese Christian Ministerial Training Institute, Huai‚Äôen Evening Theological College, and the Shanghai Bible Study Society to form the China Christian Shanghai Spirituality Theological Institute, where Chia Yu Ming continued to serve as president. During the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1957, Chia was classified as a ‚Äúpredetermined rightist.‚Äù</p>
<p>In November 1960, at the Second National Conference of Chinese Christianity, Chia was re-elected as vice-president of the Second Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Chinese Christianity. Chia Yu Ming passed away on April 12, 1964, in Shanghai at the age of 84.</p>
<p>Chia Yu Ming was a prolific author, publishing works such as ‚ÄúÊñ∞ËæØÊÉë‚Äù (New Confusions, 1923), ‚Äú‰ª•Ë≥Ω‰∫ûÊõ∏Ë¨õÁæ©‚Äù (Commentary on the Book of Isaiah, 1924), ‚ÄúÈùà‰øÆÊó•Ë™≤‚Äù (Daily Devotions, 1925), ‚ÄúÁæÖÈ¶¨Êñ∞Ë¨õÁæ©‚Äù (New Commentary on Romans, 1925), ‚ÄúÂ∏å‰ºØ‰æÜË¨õÁæ©‚Äù (Commentary on Hebrews, 1926), ‚ÄúÊïôÁâßÂ≠∏‚Äù (Pastoral Theology, 1926), ‚ÄúÂÆ£ÈÅìÊ≥ï‚Äù (Method of Preaching, 1926), ‚ÄúÊãîÊë©Áï∞Ë±°‚Äù (Visions of Patmos, 1928), ‚ÄúÁ¥ÑÁø∞Á¶èÈü≥Ë¨õÁæ©‚Äù (Commentary on the Gospel of John, 1929), ‚ÄúÈõÖÊ≠åË¨õÈ°å‚Äù (Topics on the Song of Solomon, 1930), ‚Äú‰∫îÂçÅ‰∫åÈùàÁ®ãË¨õÈ°å‚Äù (Topics on the Fifty-Two Spiritual Journeys, 1930), ‚ÄúÁ•ûÈÅìÂ≠∏‚Äù (Theology, 1949), ‚ÄúÂÆåÂÖ®ÊïëÊ≥ï‚Äù (The Perfect Way to Salvation, 1949), and ‚ÄúËÅñÁ∂ìË¶ÅÁæ©‚Äù (Essentials of the Bible). He also made significant contributions to the creation of Christian hymns. To meet the needs of spiritual gatherings, he compiled and published hymnals such as ‚ÄúÈùà‰∫§Ë©©Ê≠å‚Äù (Spiritual Fellowship Hymns, 1930), ‚ÄúÂæóÂãùË©©Ê≠å‚Äù (Victory Hymns, 1938), and ‚ÄúËÅñÂæíÂøÉËÅ≤‚Äù (Voices of the Saints, 1943), which included many hymns created by him.</p>

<li>Fan Tianxiang</li>
</ol>
<p>Fan Tianxiang (ËåÉÂ§©Á••, Bliss M. Wiant, 1895-1975) was born in Clark County, Ohio, USA. His father, William Allen Wiant, served as the senior pastor of the Central Methodist Church in Springfield, Ohio, from 1911 to 1917.</p>
<p>In 1914, after graduating from Springfield South High School, Fan enrolled at Wittenberg College (part of Ohio Wesleyan University). During World War I, he was drafted into the U.S. Navy, and he completed his university education in 1920. During his time in college, he was determined to become a missionary in China and felt called to compile a Chinese hymnbook.</p>
<p>After marrying Mildred K. Artz in 1922, the couple traveled to China, where Fan established the music department at the newly founded Yenching University. His wife taught vocal music. After the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, Fan was chosen to be the organist for the funeral. In 1927, he formed the Yenching University Choir and, in May 1928, conducted its first performance of ‚ÄúMessiah,‚Äù which subsequently became a Christmas tradition maintained until 1950. Fan returned to the U.S. for a year of further study in music at Harvard University between 1928 and 1929.</p>
<p>During his time at Yenching University, Fan combined classical Chinese and folk melodies with Western-style harmonization, collaborating with Zhao Zicheng, the dean of the university‚Äôs Divinity School, to publish ‚ÄúThe Fellowship Hymnbook‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs Hymnbook‚Äù in 1931. His exploration and adaptation of local melodies, along with Zhao Zicheng‚Äôs lyrics, laid the foundation for indigenized hymns in China.</p>
<p>In 1936, Fan was involved in editing ‚ÄúPraise from All the Earth,‚Äù a hymnbook resulting from collaboration among six major Chinese church organizations, containing 72 hymns with Chinese melodies, 46 of which were associated with Fan. Fan returned to the U.S. for vacation with his family from 1935 to 1936. While at Boston University, he pursued further studies in music and obtained a master‚Äôs degree. Upon returning to Yenching, he published a foreign-language choral anthology, ‚ÄúA Choral Anthology from a Millenium of Music,‚Äù in 1937. In April of that year, the Yenching University Choir was invited by the National Government to perform ‚ÄúMessiah‚Äù in Nanjing, broadcasting to the entire nation. In 1940, he published ‚ÄúYenching Musical Works.‚Äù</p>
<p>From 1941 to 1942, during a return trip to the U.S., Fan studied church music at Union Theological Seminary in New York.After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Fan Tianxiang remained in the United States. During this time, he taught at Scarritt College and pursued a Doctorate in Music at Peabody College. In 1946, he completed his doctoral thesis, titled ‚ÄúThe Character and Function of Music in Chinese Culture.‚Äù</p>
<p>From 1948 to 1951, the whole family returned to China at a time during the Chinese Civil War. Fan Tianxiang was dissatisfied with the authoritarian nature of Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs regime and felt resentment towards the U.S. support for Chiang. He sympathized with student movements opposing the civil war. In June 1948, he became the financial director at Yenching University and briefly served as acting president. Although he was concerned about the future situation, his Chinese colleagues at Yenching University (such as Lu Zhiwei) had confidence in the Communist Party. By the end of 1948, he heard that the Communist Party would treat Yenching University well, which made him optimistic. He firmly believed that staying there allowed him to witness for God. After the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of Beiping, Yenching University continued to operate normally, further increasing his optimism about the future. However, the space for church colleges increasingly narrowed, and the anti-American cultural invasion after the Korean War worsened the situation. In early 1951, Yenching University was officially taken over by the government, prompting Fan Tianxiang to decide to leave. On April 21, he departed from Beijing, traveling through Tianjin, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Taipei, and then returning to the United States via Europe.</p>
<p>From 1953 to 1955, Fan Tianxiang served as the pastor at St.&nbsp;Paul‚Äôs Methodist Church in Delaware; from 1955 to 1957, he was responsible for music ministry in Youngstown; and between 1957 and 1963, he served as a music director for various national and Ohio church organizations. From 1963 to 1965, he worked as a music professor at Chung Chi College in Hong Kong while also overseeing the Asian music program for the American Christian Association and gave lectures at several seminaries in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Fan Tianxiang passed away in Ohio in 1975 at the age of 80.</p>

<li>Yang Yinliu</li>
</ol>
<p>Yang Yinliu (Ê•äËî≠ÁÄè, 1899-1984), courtesy name Rujing and also known as Liangqing, was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. He received a traditional Chinese education from a young age, learning Chinese classics, poetry, and music theory in a private school starting at age six. From an early age, he exhibited a strong interest in music and began learning traditional Chinese instruments such as the sheng, xiao, dizi, and huqin at seven. At around the age of ten, Yang came to the attention of American Episcopal missionary Louise S. Hammond, who recognized his musical talent and taught him piano and Western music theory, laying the groundwork for his future in Christian music composition.</p>
<p>After graduating from Donglin Primary School in Wuxi County in 1915, Yang studied in a private school for a year to review ancient texts. He then entered the third normal school in Wuxi and graduated with honors at the age of 21. In 1920, Yang was baptized and joined the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>In 1923, Yang entered St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University in Shanghai to study economics, later switching to English literature. During this time, he served as president of the Chinese Music Society. Following the ‚ÄúMay Thirtieth Incident‚Äù in 1925, Yang became involved in student movements, leading him to become dissatisfied with the school authorities and transfer to Guanghua University. While studying there, he gained recognition for his research on Chinese music and won first prize in an English essay competition with his paper, ‚ÄúAn Outline History of Chinese Music.‚Äù Financial difficulties interrupted his studies, but he remained active in education and music research. After leaving Shanghai, he returned to Wuxi and worked as a teacher in a secondary school.</p>
<p>In 1928, the National Assembly of the Chinese Episcopal Church approved the editing of a hymnbook for use across various dioceses, which was later named ‚ÄúThe Hymn Book of Praise.‚Äù Under the recommendation of Louise S. Hammond, Yang was hired as a full-time committee member to participate in its editing. In April 1931, ‚ÄúThe Hymn Book of Praise‚Äù was published. At the same time, other denominations also expressed interest in compiling hymnals, and plans for interdenominational collaboration began. Consequently, the China Christian Church, Chinese Episcopal Church, Methodist Episcopal Church, North China Congregational Church, East China Baptist Church, and the Methodist Church formed the ‚ÄúJoint Hymn Editing Committee of Six Churches‚Äù to prepare for the compilation of a united hymnbook. Hammond again recommended Yang as a committee member, and he later became the general secretary of the editorial committee, responsible for translation, editing, and composition. In 1932, he went to Beiping to work with Liu Tingfang from Yenching University on the editing work. In the winter of 1933, he assisted Liu in editing ‚ÄúThe Amethyst,‚Äù serving as an editorial assistant. From 1934 onward, he began a column on religious music theory titled ‚ÄúHymns and Sacred Music‚Äù in ‚ÄúTruth and Life,‚Äù co-editing it with Liu Tingfang.In 1936, the ‚ÄúPraise from All the Earth‚Äù was published, for which Yang Yinliu collaborated with Dr.&nbsp;Liu Tingfang to translate and revise 210 hymns, with 150 of them translated solely by Yang. He also composed melodies for 13 of these hymns, which laid a foundation for the development of Chinese Christian music.</p>
<p>Yang Yinliu was particularly notable for his use of elements from Chinese traditional music. He adapted ancient Chinese pieces like ‚ÄúYangguan Sandie‚Äù into hymns, imbuing them with Christian meaning through harmonization and counterpoint techniques. His works not only showcased the integration of Eastern and Western music but also reflected a deep cultural refinement and religious faith.</p>
<p>From 1936 to 1937, Yang served as a music researcher at the Harvard Yenching Institute in Beiping and taught Chinese music history at Yenching University. In the 1940s, he was a professor in the Chinese Music Department at the National Conservatory of Music and at Jinling Women‚Äôs University. After the end of the War of Resistance in 1945, he moved to Nanjing with the National Conservatory of Music. He received an invitation from Harvard University to study Chinese music and literature in the U.S. but politely declined, believing that the ‚Äúliving treasure of Chinese music‚Äù was in the hands of the Chinese people and should be studied locally.</p>
<p>After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, Yang Yinliu became a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music. He also served as an executive member of the Chinese Musicians‚Äô Association. When the Cultural Revolution broke out, he was sent to the Hebei Wuqigang Cadre School, but he was reassigned back to Beijing in 1972. In 1973, he suffered from a brain spasm, which deteriorated his health. Around 1980, he served as an advisor at the China Art Research Institute. He passed away in Beijing on February 25, 1984, at the age of 84.</p>
<p>Yang Yinliu was one of the most important music historians and theorists in 20th-century China. He made remarkable contributions in the fields of Chinese music research and the translation and composition of Christian hymns.</p>

<li>Zhang Xuegong</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhang Xuegong (ÂºµÂ≠∏ÊÅ≠, 1897-1962), courtesy name Zhongwen, was born into a poor farming family in Weifang, Shandong Province. At that time, American Presbyterian missionary Grace Mary Rowley spread the Gospel to the Zhang family. First, his grandmother believed, followed by other family members. Zhang Xuegong participated in the Presbyterian Church from a young age, guided by Grace Rowley, which helped him establish a solid foundation of faith.</p>
<p>In 1912, Zhang entered Guangwen Academy and, with Rowley‚Äôs support, attended Shandong Christian University (later renamed Qilu University). After graduating, he was called to ministry and studied theology at Qilu for a year before transferring to the North China Theological Seminary. After graduating in 1924, he initially preached in Guangrao and was later invited by Watson Hayes to teach at the North China Theological Seminary. In 1927, he briefly served as the principal of Weifang Wenmei School. In 1928, he went to the United States to study theology at Princeton Theological Seminary and later attended classes at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. During his time in the U.S., he completed his first book on missions, ‚ÄúPersonal Evangelism.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1930, Zhang returned to the North China Theological Seminary to teach, becoming the vice president in 1934 to assist Hayes, and then serving as the second president in 1937. After the Pacific War, the Japanese military sealed off the seminary, and all foreign teachers were interned in detention camps. Zhang faced threats from the Japanese military while insisting on maintaining the seminary‚Äôs operations. He not only led students and church members in overcoming difficulties but also successfully protected the girls in the orphanage from harm.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1945, after years of war, all the seminary‚Äôs buildings and equipment were severely damaged, forcing them to temporarily relocate to Xuzhou in the spring of the following year to maintain their academic schedule. However, Zhang had plans to establish the Taidong Theological Seminary in Nanjing, leading him to resign from the North China Theological Seminary in April 1946.</p>
<p>In May 1949, Zhang moved the Taidong Theological Seminary from Huangnigang in Nanjing southward, passing through Changsha, and eventually relocated to Guilin, Guangxi in the winter. He established a chapel (Longzhu Road Chapel) for the faculty and students of the seminary and local congregants to gather. By the end of 1950, due to the impact of the Korean War, the seminary announced it would reject donations from the United States. In February 1951, under the patriotic anti-imperialist atmosphere, the Christian Association Preparatory Committee was formed in Guilin, and the Taidong Theological Seminary participated. In March, the Guilin Christian Association was officially established, with Zhang serving as vice-chairman. By the end of 1951, both the seminary and church ceased operations.</p>
<p>On March 17, 1955, after the establishment of the Guilin Three-Self Reform Movement Committee, the Christian Association was dissolved.On September 22-23, 1956, the first representative meeting of the Guilin Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was held, with Zhang Xuegong serving as the chairman (Compilation Committee 1997: 3212).</p>
<p>In 1956, at the second plenary (expanded) meeting of the Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, Zhang Xuegong attended as an invited representative. In his speech, he stated that ‚Äúevangelism and leading people to Christ is the most fundamental mission of the Chinese Church,‚Äù emphasizing that to accomplish this work, ‚Äúone must rely on God‚Äôs grace and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.‚Äù He also expressed the hope to establish more theological colleges to ‚Äútrain some patriotic youths dedicated to the church, and to diligently study and explore Biblical truths and Christian doctrines‚Äù (Zhang Xuegong 1956: 13-14).</p>
<p>In August 1958, Zhang Xuegong was labeled a rightist, accused of ‚Äústealing the position of chairman of the Guilin Christian Three-Self Patriotic Committee, having a consistent reactionary nature, and utilizing two-faced tactics, harboring a deep-seated hatred for the Party,‚Äù also citing his 1956 commentary that ‚Äúthe Three-Self is arrogant, self-righteous, and self-aware of its flaws,‚Äù and a 1957 statement that ‚Äúthe Party‚Äôs leadership over the Church must have limits‚Äù (Tianfeng 1958: 29).</p>
<p>In 1962, Zhang Xuegong faced persecution for his faith and became a martyr for Christ while imprisoned in Guangxi, passing away at the age of 65. His tombstone is engraved with the words ‚ÄúThe Lord‚Äôs faithful servant.‚Äù</p>

<li>Song Shangjie</li>
</ol>
<p>Song Shangjie (ÂÆãÂ∞öÁØÄ, John Sung, 1901-1944) was born into a Christian family in Putian, Fujian Province. His father, Song Xuelian, was a pastor with the Methodist Episcopal Church and served as vice-president of the Xinghua Evangelical College. Growing up in a Christian environment, he participated in revival meetings from an early age. In 1913, he entered the Methodist Episcopal Church‚Äôs philosophy school and graduated in 1919. With the help of missionaries, he received a scholarship to study chemistry at Ohio Wesleyan University in the United States, graduating with honors in 1923. He then continued his studies at Ohio State University, pursuing a master‚Äôs and doctoral degree, and finally earned his Ph.D.&nbsp;in 1926. During his time at OSU, he was licensed as a local preacher by the Indianola Methodist Episcopal Church and participated in the International Student Forum co-sponsored by the YMCA and the Methodist Church.</p>
<p>After graduating, chemistry professors recommended him to Germany for further study, and Peking Union Medical College also expressed interest in hiring him to teach physiological chemistry upon his return. However, he decided instead to study theology and enrolled in Union Theological Seminary in New York in September 1926. However, he found the seminary‚Äôs strong liberal theological orientation incompatible, feeling it did not contribute to his spiritual growth. On the night of February 10, 1927, he experienced a spiritual rebirth, often singing praises and weeping, and began preaching and witnessing outside, urging others to turn to Christ. The seminary considered his mental state unstable and forcibly sent him to Bloomingdale Hospital in New York for treatment on February 17, where he was hospitalized for a total of 193 days, discharged on August 30. After his discharge, he planned to return to his studies, but the seminary rejected his application to resume classes. Song later asserted that his admission to the psychiatric hospital was unnecessary and viewed it as a trial for his life and ministry. He maintained that his mental state was stable, claiming that his unusual rebirth experience had been misinterpreted as mental illness by the New York seminary. However, his diaries from the time in the hospital indicate that his mental state was indeed somewhat unstable. The hospital‚Äôs diagnosis was a ‚Äúparanoid condition/paranoid dementia praecox.‚Äù</p>
<p>In October 1927, Song returned to China by ship from Seattle. Onboard, he threw all his degree certificates and honors into the sea, demonstrating his disdain for worldly fame and fortune and his commitment to dedicated preaching. After returning to China, he first taught chemistry and the Bible at a church school in Xinghua. A year later, he resigned from teaching to begin full-time ministry, focusing mainly on towns and rural areas along the coastal regions of Fujian.From May 1931 to November 1933, Song Shangjie collaborated with the Bethel Evangelistic Association, traveling extensively throughout China. His journeys reached as far north as the three northeastern provinces, south to Hong Kong, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, east to coastal provinces and cities, and west to Hunan, Hubei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia. Over 400,000 people heard his sermons, with 18,000 individuals making commitments to faith. In 1934, he separated from the Bethel Evangelistic Association and became an independent evangelist. Subsequently, he preached across China and made five journeys to Southeast Asia, leading thousands to Christ and sparking revivals in various locales.</p>
<p>He passed away on August 18, 1944, at Peking Union Medical College at the age of 42.</p>

<li>Wang Ming Tao</li>
</ol>
<p>Wang Ming Tao (ÁéãÊòéÈÅì, 1900-1991), originally named Wang Yongsheng and nicknamed Tiezai, was born in Beijing. His father, Wang Zihou, worked at the Methodist Episcopal Hospital in Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, his family sought refuge in the embassy district at Dongjiao Minxiang, but fearing persecution by the Boxers, Wang Zihou tragically took his own life when Wang Ming Tao was just over a month old. Wang was raised by his mother, Li Wenyi. At the age of nine, he attended London Mission School, and at fourteen, influenced by a Christian classmate and after reading works by YMCA‚Äôs Xie Honglai, he was baptized on Easter. He began to lead a disciplined life and maintained a strong commitment to his faith.</p>
<p>In June 1918, after suffering a serious illness, Wang made a promise to God that he would fully obey God‚Äôs will after he recovered. After graduating from Cuiwen School, he attended the preparatory class at Huimin University. In 1919, he taught at a primary school affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in Baoding County. In 1920, he resolved to become a preacher and adopted the name ‚ÄúMing Tao.‚Äù While in school, he founded a YMCA. Soon after, influenced by a friend, he became convinced that baptism by immersion was more consistent with biblical teachings and began teaching it to students. However, the Presbyterian Church practiced sprinkling, and the school administration explicitly forbade him from continuing this, threatening his dismissal if he did. In January 1921, he asked for a re-baptism from Zhu Dingchen of the Apostolic Faith Church in Beijing, which led to him and several students being expelled from school. He began studying the Bible at home and started preaching.</p>
<p>In 1925, Wang began holding gatherings at home and preaching throughout the area. In 1927, he independently edited ‚ÄúSpirit Food Quarterly,‚Äù which continued to be published uninterrupted even amid the Japanese invasion. The ‚ÄúSpirit Food Quarterly‚Äù totaled 114 editions and became a model of independent publication for Chinese fundamentalists. Due to its popularity among believers, Wang was frequently invited to lead revival meetings across the country. Theologically, he represented Christian fundamentalism and publicly criticized liberal theology.</p>
<p>In 1930, he held meetings in a small alley in Beiping, and as the number of attendees grew, he rented the Longfu Temple Social Hall and a venue on Qiaomian Hutong starting in 1933. In 1936, he purchased a site on Shijia Hutong, officially naming it the ‚ÄúChristian Assembly,‚Äù which became a typical example of an indigenous self-reliant church in China. Following the occupation of Beiping, he refused to comply with the Japanese military‚Äôs demands to publish their slogans in the ‚ÄúSpirit Food Quarterly.‚Äù After the Pacific War, the Japanese military requested various denominations to merge into the ‚ÄúNorth China Chinese Christian Group.‚Äù Wang rejected this due to ‚Äúdifferences in faith‚Äù, refusing to cooperate with what he saw as ‚Äúunbelieving factions‚Äù within the denomination. Despite facing tremendous pressure, he was not dealt with harshly by the Japanese authorities, and both the ‚ÄúSpirit Food Quarterly‚Äù and Christian Assembly continued their operations regularly. Wang believed this was a victory for obedience to God.</p>
<p>After the victory over Japan, Wang continued to lead meetings nationwide. After the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, Wang refused to participate in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement led by the Communist Party and publicly resisted it, becoming one of the few vocal opponents of the movement from a spiritual perspective. In 1955 and 1958, he was arrested twice by the Chinese government, and in 1961, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of being a ‚Äúcounter-revolutionary.‚Äù Following his first arrest, churches nationwide initiated a campaign to rid themselves of the ‚ÄúWang Ming Tao Counter-revolutionary Group.‚Äù In January 1980, he was released early from Shanxi Yinying Prison and relocated to Shanghai, where he continued to host religious gatherings at home. Wang Ming Tao passed away on July 28, 1991, at the age of 91, still bearing the label of a ‚Äúcounter-revolutionary.‚Äù</p>
<p>All of Wang Ming Tao‚Äôs works were published by the Spirit Food Quarterly Publishing House and mainly collected his articles from the ‚ÄúSpirit Food Quarterly‚Äù by themes. These included critiques of modernism in ‚ÄúCan Man Build the Kingdom of Heaven?‚Äù (1933) and ‚ÄúDistinguishing True and False Gospels‚Äù (1936). His representative works on faith include ‚ÄúWho is Christ?‚Äù (1928), ‚ÄúWhy I Believe the Bible is Inspired by God‚Äù (1933), and ‚ÄúThe True Meaning of Being Born Again‚Äù (1935).He provided numerous teachings for the lives of believers, including works such as ‚ÄúThe Christian‚Äôs Speech‚Äù (1933), ‚ÄúThe Believer‚Äôs Exhortation‚Äù (1935), ‚ÄúA Letter to Suffering Saints‚Äù (1935), ‚ÄúThe Common Sense of Believers‚Äù (1936), and ‚ÄúChristians and Marriage‚Äù (1943). His publications in 1955, such as ‚ÄúSeveral Important Questions,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Message of the Times,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe Are for Faith,‚Äù became important criticisms against the Three-Self Movement. In 1950, he published his autobiography ‚ÄúFifty Years.‚Äù</p>

<li>Miner S. Bates</li>
</ol>
<p>Miner S. Bates (Ë≤ùÂæ∑Â£´, 1897-1978) was born in Newark, Ohio. His father, Miner L. Bates, was a pastor with the Disciples of Christ and served as the president of Hiram College. After graduating from Hiram College, Bates received a Rhodes Scholarship to study history at Oxford University.</p>
<p>From 1917 to 1918, Bates worked with the YMCA in India and the Near East, specifically in Mesopotamia, and later formally enlisted in the U.S. Army. After returning from military service, he continued his studies in modern Chinese history at Oxford, graduating in 1920. Upon returning to the United States, he was sent to China by the United Christian Missionary Society (the Disciples of Christ) to teach history at Jinling University in Nanjing, where he remained until 1950 for a total of 30 years. Jinling University was established in 1910 through the merger of three American Christian mission-supported universities. During his time there, he returned to the U.S. and studied Japanese and Russian at Harvard University from 1934 to 1935 as a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow. He earned his Ph.D.&nbsp;in the philosophy of Chinese history from Yale University in 1935, with his research focusing on ‚ÄúThe Establishment of the Chinese Empire.‚Äù</p>
<p>Beyond teaching, Bates actively participated in the ecumenical movement. In 1938, he attended the International Missionary Council‚Äôs missionary conference in Madras, India, as a member of the Chinese delegation. He served as an East Asia advisor to the International Missionary Council from 1941 to 1945 and was a coordinator for the council‚Äôs wartime emergency efforts in China.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Jinling University relocated to Chengdu. Bates remained in Nanjing to safeguard the school‚Äôs assets and initiated the Nanking International Safety Zone Committee just before and after the city fell, also serving as the chair of the Nanking International Relief Committee. During the Nanjing Massacre, the committee played a role in protecting and rescuing Chinese refugees.</p>
<p>After the war, Bates was tasked with negotiating the recovery of the university‚Äôs property and did significant work for the restoration of Jinling University. In July 1946, he attended the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as a witness regarding the Nanjing Massacre, providing testimony about the atrocities committed by the Japanese military. In recognition of his efforts to save refugees, the National Government awarded him the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner.</p>
<p>After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Bates left China in 1950. From 1950 to 1965, he served as a professor of missionary studies and church history at Union Theological Seminary in New York and frequently participated in academic activities at Columbia University‚Äôs East Asian Studies. He was also a board member of the Association of Christian Higher Education in Asia and involved with the National Christian Council‚Äôs China Projects. After retiring in 1965, he began writing ‚ÄúThe Protestants‚Äô Endeavors in Chinese Society, 1889-1950.‚Äù His writing remained unfinished at the time of his passing in 1978, but he left behind extensive notes and materials.</p>
<p>Miner S. Bates passed away in New York in 1978.Miner S. Bates‚Äô works include: ‚ÄúChristianity and Communism‚Äù (1933), ‚ÄúMission in Far Eastern Cultural Relations‚Äù (1942), ‚ÄúHalf of Humanity: Far Eastern Peoples and Problems‚Äù (1942), ‚ÄúData on the Distribution of the Missionary Enterprise‚Äù (1943), and ‚ÄúReligious Liberty: An Inquiry‚Äù (1945).</p>

<li>Pearl S. Buck</li>
</ol>
<p>Pearl S. Buck (Ë≥ΩÁèçÁè†, 1892-1973) was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, USA. Her father, Absalom Sydenstricker, and her mother, Caroline Sydenstricker, were sent to China by the Southern Presbyterian Church to serve as missionaries in Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang in 1880. When Pearl was just three months old, her parents took her to China. Pearl was cared for from a young age by a Chinese woman named Wang Ma until she returned to the United States to attend university. Wang Ma had a profound influence on Pearl, not only teaching her Chinese but also introducing her to Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese folklore.</p>
<p>Pearl‚Äôs parents also hired a Chinese tutor named Kung to teach her Chinese and explain Chinese history and Confucian doctrine. In her memoirs, Pearl noted that she actually learned Chinese before English; Chinese was her mother tongue, while English became her second language. During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the family temporarily moved to Shanghai. In July 1901, she returned to the United States with her parents for a year, feeling as though she had gone to a ‚Äúforeign country.‚Äù At 17, she attended the Shanghai American School, where she volunteered at a church-run women‚Äôs shelter, serving lower-class women and prostitutes.</p>
<p>In 1910, Pearl returned to the United States and enrolled in Randolph-Macon Woman‚Äôs College in West Virginia, majoring in psychology. After graduating in 1914, she learned of Wang Ma‚Äôs passing and her mother‚Äôs illness. Thus, she applied to the Southern Presbyterian Church to teach at a church school in China to care for her mother.</p>
<p>In 1916, Pearl met John L. Buck, an agricultural missionary from the Southern Presbyterian Church sent to China, who primarily taught Chinese farmers about new American farming methods to prevent drought and famine. Later, Buck was transferred to Suzhou, Anhui Province, where his limited Chinese skills required Pearl to translate during communications with farmers. This opportunity allowed her to connect deeply with Chinese farmers, which led her to respect them as the people closest to the land and the most worthy of admiration. Buck was subsequently assigned to teach at the College of Agriculture at Jinling University, engaging in research and teaching about Chinese agriculture.</p>
<p>In 1921, the death of Pearl‚Äôs mother significantly impacted her. She began writing, and her first work, ‚ÄúThe Exile: Portrait of an American Mother,‚Äù centered on her mother‚Äôs life (this book would not be published until 1936). During this time, she primarily taught English at Jinling University and began writing articles critiquing China. In the summer of 1924, due to her daughter‚Äôs health, the couple returned to the U.S. Pearl simultaneously pursued a master‚Äôs degree at Cornell University. During this period, she won first prize in a school English essay competition, with her winning article discussing the impact of Western culture on Chinese society.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1926, the family returned to Nanjing, where Pearl taught English and education at Jinling University and Jinling Women‚Äôs College and continued her writing. In 1927, as the Nationalist Army attacked Nanjing, the family fled to Japan for refuge, where Pearl completed her short story ‚ÄúThe Young Revolutionist.‚Äù</p>
<p>In February 1927, Pearl published the article ‚ÄúDo Foreign Missionaries Still Have a Place?‚Äù in the Chinese Recorder.In the article ‚ÄúIs There a Place for the Foreign Missionary?‚Äù, Pearl S. Buck criticized the missionaries‚Äô outright denial of Chinese culture. She described missionaries as ‚Äúuninvited guests‚Äù who forcibly imposed their own beliefs (including lifestyle and religion) onto the Chinese, which she viewed as an expression of imperialism. By this time, she had stepped back from mission work to focus on literary creation.</p>
<p>In 1930, she published her first novel, ‚ÄúEast Wind: West Wind.‚Äù The following year, she published another novel titled ‚ÄúThe Good Earth,‚Äù centered on the poverty of rural Chinese life. In this novel, Western missionaries were depicted as ‚Äúalien people‚Äù who conveyed meaningless messages to the Chinese, detached from the joys and struggles of the local populace. ‚ÄúThe Good Earth‚Äù became a bestseller and was translated into multiple languages. With this work, Buck received the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1938.</p>
<p>In November 1932, Buck delivered a speech in the United States criticizing missionary work in China. Her criticisms of the missions and missionaries brought her significant pressure, leading her to resign from the mission board in 1933. In 1934, she left China, where she had lived for 40 years, and returned to the United States. After divorcing John L. Buck in 1935, she remarried.</p>
<p>After leaving China, Buck remained concerned about the country. During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, she expressed her protests against Japanese atrocities. In 1940, she initiated the ‚ÄúThe Book of Hope‚Äù campaign in the U.S., raising $100,000, which was presented at a reception hosted by Eleanor Roosevelt at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., to Ambassador Hu Shi for the purchase of medical supplies to be sent to China. She later established the ‚ÄúChina Emergency Relief Committee,‚Äù serving as its chairperson, and within six months, raised $1 million to assist China.</p>
<p>During World War II, Buck called on the U.S. government to strengthen its support for China‚Äôs resistance against Japan. In May 1943, during congressional hearings to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, she formed the ‚ÄúCitizens‚Äô Committee for the Repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act,‚Äù advocating for equal treatment of the Chinese people alongside others in the world. In October 1943, President Roosevelt agreed to sign the repeal of the 60-year-old Chinese Exclusion Act.</p>
<p>Throughout her life, Buck wrote over 100 literary works. She passed away on March 6, 1973, in the United States.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="christian-or-pro-christian-organizations">Christian or Pro-Christian Organizations</h2>
<p>The statistics regarding the number of communicants in China during the 1930s indicate that only 1933 (488,539), 1935 (512,873), and 1936 (536,089) are currently available. After 1937, with China embroiled in the War of Resistance against Japan, the nation was divided into occupied areas and free zones, making it difficult to gather further statistics.</p>
<p>According to Charles L. Boynton in the 1936 ‚ÄúHandbook of the Christian Movement in China Under Protestant Auspices,‚Äù by the mid-1930s, the total number of Christians from 12 denominations (including the Chinese Christian Church, China Inland Mission, Methodist Episcopal Church, Southern Baptist Convention, Chinese Episcopal Church, Chinese Lutheran Church, Wesleyan Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church, North China Congregational Church, Methodist Church, Southern Baptist Convention, and the American Baptist Convention) was around 430,000. He estimated that the total number of communicants in the country was nearly 500,000. Daniel H. Bays, a historian of Chinese Christianity, noted that Boynton‚Äôs estimate of 500,000 did not include certain indigenous Chinese sects and independent churches (such as the True Jesus Church, Christian Assembly, and the Indigenous Church of China), estimating that the missing figures could be as high as 200,000.</p>
<p>It is important to note that due to the September 18 Incident (1931), the three northeastern provinces (Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Jilin) were established as Manchukuo with Japanese support in 1932, and thus missionary surveys during the 1930s did not include these provinces. Missionary Miner Searle Bates pointed out that if the roughly 31,000 Christians in the Northeast were included, along with believers from indigenous sects and independent churches, the number of communicants in 1936 would rise to 623,000. In other words, before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the number of Christians in China had reached 700,000, marking a substantial increase of 56.7% compared to the 1928 figure of 446,631 communicants. In contrast, the growth in the number of communicants between 1920 and 1928 was only 9.8%, indicating that Chinese Christianity had moved beyond the impacts of the Anti-Christian Movement and continued to experience notable growth despite the threats posed by the Japanese invasion in the 1930s.</p>

<li>Bethel Worldwide Evangelistic Band, 1931</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bethel Worldwide Evangelistic Band was an evangelistic ministry of the Bethel Mission Church in Shanghai, established in early 1931 by Pastor Ji Zhiwen. The model was inspired by the Asbury College Evangelistic Team in the United States.</p>
<p>The main members of the evangelistic team included Li Daorong, Lin Jingkang, Nie Ziying, and Song Shangjie, with Ji Zhiwen serving as the leader. The team typically participated in spiritual devotion, Bible study, and meetings during the day led by Ji, while Song Shangjie preached in the evenings and at major revivals. The other three members were responsible for finances, communication, record-keeping, leading hymns, playing instruments, and translating. The band set off on February 18, covering 50,000 kilometers over four years, visiting 133 cities across the country and holding thousands of meetings, sharing the Gospel with hundreds of thousands of people, with about 30,000 making commitments to Christ. Among those who repented and turned to the Lord were both Chinese and foreign individuals, including workers, farmers, merchants, young students, soldiers, and even bandits, corrupt officials, and criminals. Their powerful preaching and testimonies brought revival everywhere they went. Due to the increasing demands of evangelistic work, the Bethel Worldwide Evangelistic Band established ten branches throughout the country. Inspired by their activities, many local churches also formed their own evangelistic teams. Ji Zhiwen and the Bethel Evangelistic Band spread the fire of the Gospel throughout the Great Wall and from north to south, sowing seeds of the Gospel even in remote border areas such as Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Tibet, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>In 1934, Song Shangjie left the evangelistic band to become an independent itinerant preacher.The Group of Ten (‰∏≠ËèØÂü∫Áù£Âæí‰ø°Ë°åÊïëÂúãÂçÅ‰∫∫Âúò) was established in 1932 by Zhang Zhijiang, who was then a member of the National Government and a senator in the Military Advisory Council. Intensifying Japanese aggression against China in the early 1930s, particularly following the September 18 Incident and the January 28 Incident, led Zhang to propose the formation of the group during an evangelistic discussion at the Christian Research Society. The proposal received unanimous approval. Yu Yiqing was tasked with drafting the charter, which was sent out nationwide for feedback in Zhang‚Äôs name.</p>
<p>In the account of the group‚Äôs origins, it was repeatedly emphasized that this was a time of ‚Äúnational crisis and imminent danger.‚Äù The document expressed strong awareness of the survival crisis caused by Japanese aggression, stating, ‚ÄúNow the Japanese imperialists are exploiting the failures of our national revolution to invade our country, massacre our compatriots, occupy our land, and commit unspeakable atrocities, making national extermination a pressing danger. Mr.&nbsp;Sun Yat-sen said that the greatest task humanity must undertake every day is self-defense. Whether as individuals, groups, or a nation, one must have the capacity for self-defense to survive. Therefore, at this time, apart from personal sacrifice, struggle, self-defense, and self-rescue, there is no other way to exist. Thus, every citizen must do their part to save our endangered country. Christians should especially do so‚Ä¶‚Äù This indicates that the response to national hardship was an important background to the formation of the Group of Ten.</p>
<p>The Group of Ten not only expressed the intention of saving the nation ideologically but also required its members to uphold the unity of faith and action. They were called to ‚Äúactively engage in personal evangelism, encourage believers, and work hard at the sacred task, with everyone taking responsibility to watch over and repay the debt to God, leading many to faith and producing spiritual fruit.‚Äù No matter where they were, they were to ‚Äútestify through faith and actions,‚Äù viewing the conversion of others as their primary responsibility. Zhang Zhijiang specifically required each member to ‚Äúspeak to someone about the Gospel at least once a week‚Äù and to lead one person to faith within six months (later amended to one year). His vision was that if all 500,000 Christians in China could mobilize to implement this standard (still counting one person led to faith every six months), then in five years, over 500 million people in China would turn to Christ.</p>
<p>Although Zhang‚Äôs actions represented a movement for ‚Äúsaving souls,‚Äù he emphasized that the Gospel should serve as a means for saving the nation, not just for the salvation of souls. Thus, the concept of national salvation was overwhelmingly significant in the beliefs of the Group of Ten. As he emphasized: the salvation of people cannot forget the salvation of the nation; to save the nation, one must first save the people.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Group of Ten, Zhang submitted the revised ‚ÄúOrigins and Charter‚Äù to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Government for filing. However, due to the lack of published religious laws at the time, the Committee on Mass Movements of the Central Party had no basis for processing it, which led to delays. Between 1936 and 1937, regional groups of the Ten and the main group repeatedly wrote to the Ministry of People‚Äôs Training and the Central Committee of the Executive Council, urging the timely promulgation of religious laws or permitting the Group of Ten to register as a cultural organization. In July 1937, the Group was finally registered as a cultural organization and became a legal entity.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhang worked to promote the group at the church level. On February 25, 1932, he convened a conference of church leaders in Shanghai, attended by many prominent church leaders and individuals from Shanghai, such as Wang Zhengtong, Zhao Jinqing, Li Denghui, and Luo Yunyan. After several preparatory meetings, the Shanghai regional group held its founding conference at the Moulton Chapel on April 9, with over 250 members registered. Following the establishment of the Shanghai regional group, Zhang planned for the formation of a main group and various regional branches. By 1933, the official membership numbered 1,423. In 1934, the China Christian Group of Ten officially established its headquarters in Nanjing, holding its first formal meeting from April 1 to 4 at the Nanjing Christian Association, publishing a special issue of the ‚ÄúGroup of Ten‚Äù to outline the purpose of the group‚Äôs mission. Nearly 300 church leaders and social figures agreed to be founding members, transcending theological divisions, including notable church leaders like Cheng Jingyi, Jiang Changchuan, Chen Chonggui, Zhang Zhuling, Wang Aitang, Jia Yuming, Ding Limei, Ji Zhiwen, Zhao Shiguang, Zhao Liutang, Liu Zhannen, and prominent Christians from other fields such as Niu Yongjian, Wang Zhengtong, Jian Youwen, Li Denghui, Kong Xiangxi, Yu Rizhang, Luo Yunyan, Chen Jinyong, Xie Songgao, Zhong Rongguang, Liang Xiaochu, Ma Boyuan, and Wu Yifang.(3) Christian Tabernacle, 1933</p>
<p>The Christian Tabernacle is a notable independent church in China, founded by Wang Ming Tao. Wang was baptized at a London Mission and later taught at the Presbyterian Church. In 1921, due to issues surrounding re-baptism, he severed ties with the Presbyterian Church and left the school. He was briefly influenced by the Apostolic Faith Church but ultimately left that as well due to differing understandings of the doctrine of justification by faith. Starting in 1924, Wang began working independently and initiated a Bible study group at home. In 1927, he founded the ‚ÄúSpirit Food Quarterly,‚Äù primarily publishing his articles, which would later be compiled into published works. The ‚ÄúSpirit Food Quarterly‚Äù became a well-received publication among believers, attracting many readers and leading to invitations for him to preach across various regions.</p>
<p>In 1933, due to an increase in the number of attendees, the group began renting the Longfu Temple Social Hall for meetings, later renting the venue on Qiaomian Hutong. In 1936, they purchased a site on Shijia Hutong and officially named it the ‚ÄúChristian Tabernacle.‚Äù The Christian Tabernacle did not establish branches but was a gathering place in Beiping (now Beijing) with around 500 attendees. However, due to Wang Ming Tao‚Äôs influence, the tabernacle became a spiritually influential independent church in Beiping. During the Japanese occupation and after the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the Christian Tabernacle did not participate in the officially promoted unified organizations.</p>

<li>Christian Broadcast Association, 1933</li>
</ol>
<p>In August 1929, the National Government announced telecommunications regulations that allowed private enterprises to operate radio stations. Beginning in the 1930s, a number of privately run broadcasting stations emerged in major cities. The earliest Christian radio station in China was the Christian Broadcast Association in Shanghai, located on the rooftop of the Christian Literature Society of China building. The station received approval from the Ministry of Communications of the National Government and officially began broadcasting in December 1933.</p>
<p>The Christian Broadcast Association positioned itself as ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Radio Station,‚Äù aiming to glorify God and save lost souls. The Shanghai Christian Broadcast Station aired programs daily from Monday to Saturday at 7:45 AM, including music, devotional morning prayers, English midday devotions, family health topics, Bible studies, stories, and sermons, concluding with evening prayers at 9:40 PM. Sunday mornings featured retransmissions of the English service from the Trinity Church, with afternoon broadcasts of Mandarin encouragement services and Anglican Mandarin services. Evening broadcasts included Cantonese services and Mandarin sermons. Additionally, there were programs in French, Russian, and various local Chinese dialects. In 1936, the ‚ÄúChristian Broadcast Bulletin‚Äù was published, and the Christian Literature Society also compiled the morning prayers broadcasted by the station into published volumes.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army occupied Shanghai in 1937, the Christian Broadcast Association refused to register with the Japanese authorities, leading American nationals within the church to register with the American consulate. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Shanghai Christian Broadcast Station collaborated with the National Christian Council of China, taking on the responsibility of conveying church and relief information during wartime. However, during the Pacific War in December 1941, the station was eventually taken over by Japanese forces.</p>
<p>In the early years after the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the Shanghai Christian Broadcast Station was still operational, but with the intensification of control across all sectors during the Anti-American and Aid Korea campaign at the end of 1950, the authorities required all private broadcasting stations to shut down. On January 24, 1951, the historically significant Shanghai Christian Broadcast Association officially ceased operations.(5) Chung Hua Sheng Ching Hui / The China Bible House, 1937</p>
<p>In May 1937, the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), the National Bible Society of Scotland (NBSS), and the American Bible Society (ABS) united to form the Chung Hua Sheng Ching Hui (China Bible House) in Shanghai. As early as 1921, George C. Lacy, a representative of the American Bible Society in China, had proposed the idea of merging the three Bible societies. In July 1932, representatives from the three societies met in London to discuss how to facilitate the establishment of a national Bible society in China, deciding that each society would nominate six individuals to form an advisory council. The Advisory Council of the Bible Societies in China was formed in June 1933, with Cheng Jingyi, who was also the general secretary of the National Christian Council of China and president of the Chinese Christian Church, as its chairman. However, unification efforts were hindered because the British and American Bible societies disagreed with the Scottish Bible Society‚Äôs insistence on maintaining annotations in the Chinese Bible. In early 1936, the latter decided to withdraw from the unification plan. In April 1937, the Chung Hua Sheng Ching Hui was established, with Yu Ensu as president and George C. Lacy as the general secretary. In 1944, R. Mortensen succeeded Lacy as the second general secretary. The Scottish Bible Society began participating in the work of the China Bible House in 1942, officially joining in 1946.</p>

<li>National Christian Service Council for Wounded Soldiers in Transit, 1937</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937, fierce battles erupted between Chinese and Japanese forces in Shanghai in August. Facing a large number of wounded soldiers, the National Army was unable to provide timely rescue efforts. Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi acknowledged the government‚Äôs failure to address the issue of wounded soldiers and called on Christian churches for assistance. In October, the National Christian Council of China, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and the Chinese Medical Association invited A. R. Kepler, the general secretary of the National Christian Church, to investigate refugee conditions and the support provided by relief organizations in Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, while also exploring how Christianity could assist wounded soldiers and what role it could play in the international crisis. During the trip, Kepler witnessed many wounded soldiers lacking adequate medical care, and the transport of the wounded was poorly organized. Thus, he advocated for the formation of a wounded soldiers‚Äô service organization by Christian groups.</p>
<p>Thanks to Kepler‚Äôs efforts, the National Christian Church decided to initiate the wounded soldiers‚Äô service and established the National Christian Service Council for Wounded Soldiers in Transit. Key participants included Kepler, Fan Dingjiu, Zhang Bohuai, and Geng Yuanxue. After the council was formed, Zhang Bohuai was sent to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Guizhou to carry out preparatory work, connecting with church leaders as well as local military and government officials and other charitable organizations.</p>
<p>In April 1938, the council executive committee approved the list of responsible members, with Kong Xiangxi and Yan Fuqing serving as co-presidents, Huang Renlin and Zhong Ketuo as vice presidents, and Zhang Bohuai and Geng Yuanxue serving as district supervisors. Kepler was appointed as the principal officer of the council.</p>
<p>In the initial two months, the council primarily provided basic services such as supplying goods and transporting the wounded. Later, the services expanded to include care for the wounded (changing dressings, washing, assisting with bodily needs, writing letters, and first aid). They also set up clubs in hospitals, providing books, chess, Go, and phonographs, to prevent gambling among soldiers. Additionally, the council conducted evangelistic efforts in hospital wards, inviting soldiers to church to have opportunities to share the Gospel.</p>
<p>Within just seven months of establishment, the number of service personnel grew from 71 to over 2,000. In addition to local recruitment, some came from the rear areas such as Chongqing and Guangdong.</p>
<p>In 1939, the National Council determined that due to the protracted nature of the war, they could no longer undertake the service for the wounded independently and decided to separate it from the council.(7) Emergency Service to Soldiers Program of the Chinese YMCA, 1937</p>
<p>In August 1937, following the outbreak of full-scale war, the National Association of the YMCA called upon Xiang Huichian, the general secretary of the Beijing YMCA stationed in Jinan at the time, to come to Shanghai to discuss the initiation of frontline services. It was decided that the National Association would raise funds to establish the ‚ÄúYMCA Service to Soldiers Program,‚Äù with Xiang (also known as Xiao Fengyuan) appointed as the general secretary.</p>
<p>In early August 1937, the ‚ÄúNational Christian Service to Soldiers Program of the Chinese YMCA‚Äù was officially established, with service stations distributed across various regions. At that time, the war was primarily focused in Hebei and Shanxi, and the headquarters was located in Jinan, with branches in Tongpu, Longhai, Pinghan, and Jintan, concentrating their activities along the major railway lines in northern China. By December 1937, 28 service stations had been established in places such as Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Kaifeng.</p>
<p>As early 1938 approached, the war in northern China gradually moved south, prompting the headquarters to relocate to Zhengzhou. By May, additional service stations were set up in Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Tai‚Äôerzhuang, Xuzhou, Luoyang, and Xi‚Äôan. In June, the headquarters moved to Xuchang and Hankou. To maintain communication, the organization divided the operational areas into four regions: Shaanxi, Henan, Sichuan-Hubei, and Hunan-Jiangxi, each overseen by a director responsible for regional duties, comprising 24 branches. After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the headquarters moved to Chongqing, encompassing seven operational areas, including Shaanxi, Sichuan-Hubei, Shanxi-Yu, Hunan-Guangdong, and Guangxi, with over 30 branches established in these areas. The program focused on the Yangtze River and inland roadways during this time, with a total of 50 branches and five mobile work teams by 1940.</p>
<p>However, the Soldiers‚Äô Service Program faced difficulties in survival. Some branches had to disband due to financial issues, losing contact with the headquarters, while others were disbanded by the local Kuomintang government under charges of ‚Äúleftist thinking‚Äù or forced to ‚Äúleave the country,‚Äù and even some officials from the program were arrested under accusations of ‚Äúsuspected collusion with enemy forces.‚Äù While the program once boasted 50 branches and five mobile work teams, by the end of 1942, only the Guangxi branch and the Yunnan-Myanmar area remained active. In 1943, a branch was established in the Yunnan-Myanmar region. After the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan in 1945, the Yunnan-Myanmar branch announced its closure, marking the end of the Soldiers‚Äô Service Program‚Äôs historical mission. From 1940 to 1943, the program served as many as 37 million people.</p>

<li>Student Relief Committee of Chinese YMCA and Student Service Center, 1938</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the full-scale War of Resistance started in 1937, a large number of students fled from the Japanese-occupied zones, becoming refugees. The YMCA and the YWCA jointly initiated a ‚ÄúStudent Relief Program during Extraordinary Times,‚Äù establishing the ‚ÄúShanghai Student Relief Committee‚Äù to assist refugee students from Beiping and Tianjin. In addition to Shanghai, student relief committees were subsequently established in places such as Beiping, Fuzhou, Xi‚Äôan, Wuchang, Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Guilin. In March 1938, the National YMCA and YWCA decided to establish a ‚ÄúNational Student Relief Committee‚Äù in Shanghai, with J. Usang Ly, President of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, as chairman. Liang Xiaochu served as the executive general secretary, while Jiang Wenhan and Shi Baozhen took roles as general secretaries for the Student Department. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the student relief committee temporarily relocated to Chengdu, and then moved to Chongqing in September 1942. By this time, the number of local student relief committees had grown to 28.</p>
<p>Additionally, addressing the students at national universities located in remote areas, the National Christian Council collaborated with the YMCA and YWCA to establish the ‚ÄúEvangelism among Government University Students‚Äù committee.</p>
<p>At that time, the refugee students fell into three categories: (1) those who continued their studies in their current locations or moved to the rear areas for study; (2) those who couldn‚Äôt continue studying due to the war and enlisted; (3) those who participated in anti-Japanese rescue efforts or sought employment in the rear areas.The Student Relief Committee‚Äôs work focused primarily on the first category of students. Its main activities included fundraising domestically and abroad to assist students through several initiatives: (1) establishing work-study positions to provide opportunities for part-time jobs to prevent students from dropping out; (2) providing subsidies for refugee students to return to their original homes or relocate to inland areas for study; (3) arranging dormitories for both refugee students and students studying in the rear areas, and organizing activities; (4) providing short-term jobs for temporarily displaced students. Funding for the student relief efforts largely came from abroad, from organizations such as the International Student Service, the Far-East Student Emergency Fund, and the Far-East Student Service Fund.</p>
<p>To accommodate the refugee students, the Student Relief Committee established ‚ÄúChristian Student Service Centers‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúChristian Student Communities‚Äù) at national universities in remote areas, while also serving local church colleges. By 1943, a total of 12 student service centers or communities had been established: (1) Chenggu, Shaanxi (Northwest United University and Northwest Normal University); (2) Jiading, Sichuan (Wuhan University and Central Polytechnic School); (3) Shapingba, Chongqing (Central University, Chongqing University, Sichuan Normal University, and Nankai Middle School); (4) Zunyi and Meitan in Guizhou (Zhejiang University); (5) Liangfeng, Guangxi (Guangxi University); (6) Pingshi, Guangdong (Sun Yat-sen University); (7) Guizhou from Guangxi (Guangdong Provincial Arts and Sciences College); (8) Shaping ba in Chengdu (West China University, Jinling University, Qilu University, and Jinling Women‚Äôs College); (9) Majiabao in Hanzhong (Northwest Medical University); (10) San Tai, Sichuan (Northeast University); (11) Kunming, Yunnan (Southwest United University and Yunnan University); (12) Gulu Ba, Shaanxi (Northwest Institute of Technology).</p>
<p>The student service centers (or student communities) primarily provided a space for collective activities where students could sing, play games, study, discuss various life issues, and even receive vocational training. Due to limitations in the campus environments of wartime universities, the student service centers became the main leisure and activity hubs for students. Each service center or community had student officers responsible for its activities, allowing students to take charge and cultivate a spirit of service.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, many universities began to relocate back to their original locations, and the student communities continued to serve students at various universities. The National Committee for Religious Work among Government University Students was renamed the National Committee for Religious Work among University Students.</p>
<p>By 1949, there were still eight student communities active nationwide, located at Tsinghua University in Beiping, Northeast University in Shenyang, Jinling Women‚Äôs University in Nanjing, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the Student Community at Lake Luojia in Wuchang, the Student Community in Chongqing, and the Student Community in Chengdu.</p>
<p>From the War of Resistance to the post-war period, the student communities were targets for infiltration by the underground Communist Party. For example, the notable underground pastor Li Chuwen was involved in leading the student service during the war in Kunming.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>National Federation of Student Christian Unions, 1939</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chinese Christian Student Movement began taking shape in 1922 during the 11th assembly of the World Student Christian Federation held in Beijing, where a proposal was passed to establish a Christian student movement in China. This was subsequently organized through cooperation between the YMCA and YWCA, alongside student volunteer evangelistic movements. Based on local school YMCA groups and student fellowships, the Preparatory Committee for the Chinese Christian Student Movement was established in July 1927 at Jinling Women‚Äôs University in Nanjing. The committee determined its movement‚Äôs goals to be ‚Äúguided by the spirit of Jesus, creating youth fellowships, establishing sound personalities, and advocating for the liberation and development of people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù Originally, there was an intent to include ‚Äúto carry out revolution‚Äù between ‚Äúestablishing sound personalities‚Äù and ‚Äúadvocating for the liberation and development of people‚Äôs lives,‚Äù but this was later removed by student leaders, who felt that while the ‚ÄúNational Revolution‚Äù was idealistic, it was prone to becoming a clich√©.</p>
<p>In 1933, the committee convened the National Fellowship Conference at Hujiang University in Shanghai, resulting in the formation of the Chinese Christian Student Movement‚Äôs Temporary National Assembly (referred to as the ‚ÄúTemporary Assembly‚Äù). The formal establishment of the Chinese Christian Student Movement was projected for 1936. However, due to the war, plans for a national assembly were delayed until 1939.(9) National Christian Student Representative Conference, 1939</p>
<p>From August 14 to 20, 1939, the National Christian Student Representative Conference was held in the rear area of the War of Resistance at Guandu, Kunming. Twenty-five representatives attended from Beiping, Shanghai, Fujian, Hong Kong, Yunnan, Guiyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu. The main theme of the conference was ‚ÄúChristianity and the Construction of New China,‚Äù with speakers including Pan Guangdan, Zhao Zichan, Gilbert Baker, Shi Baozhen, Ding Guangxun, and Jiang Wenhan. At the conclusion of the conference, the National Federation of Student Christian Unions was established. The Federation had three executive secretaries: Jiang Wenhan (Director of the YMCA Department for Student Associations), Shi Baozhen (Executive Secretary of the YWCA Student Department), and Ding Guangxun (Executive Secretary of the Shanghai YMCA). Emerged from the pressing circumstances, the National Christian Student Movement faced many challenges before establishing this formal national organization.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúDeclaration of the National Christian Student Representative Conference‚Äù in 1939 reiterated the vision for ‚Äúsaving the nation‚Äù and reaffirmed their stance for the times: (1) advocating unity, opposing division, and completing the nation-building process; (2) insisting on continuing the war without compromise; (3) advocating the establishment of a democratic political system and implementing socialist economic principles of ‚Äúeach giving according to ability and each taking according to need‚Äù; (4) promoting the mobilization of national spirit as a ministry and transforming individuals from resigned existence to meaningful lives; (5) deepening international friendships and connecting all forces that uphold justice.</p>

<li>Border Service of Church of Christ in China, 1939</li>
</ol>
<p>In early 1939, Cheng Jingyi, president of the National Council of the Church of Christ in China, and Executive Secretary Li Qiongjie visited the Chongqing and Chengdu churches of the Sichuan Conference, and alongside Zhang Bohuai, Sun Ensan, Chen Liting, and Chen Tiesan, discussed the urgent need to assist the border population in the southwestern provinces to enhance their culture and improve their living conditions. Consequently, they initiated the establishment of a border service program. Cheng Jingyi and Executive Secretary Cui Xianxiang visited Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi to express the church‚Äôs willingness to serve in the rear areas during the war. In June, the National Council submitted a service plan to the Executive Yuan, which was approved for a three-year trial period with financial support. In September, the executive committee passed a proposal to launch the border service program, deciding to establish the Border Service Committee in Chongqing, with Zhang Bohuai as the director responsible for promoting the work. Cheng Jingyi from the Sichuan Conference decided to move the council‚Äôs office to Chengdu to facilitate the implementation of the border service. Although Cheng Jingyi passed away on November 15 due to illness, Cui Xianxiang and others hoped to advance this work.</p>
<p>In December 1939, the Border Service Committee held its first meeting in Chongqing, presided over by Kong Xiangxi, with representatives from the government, the church, and other educational and social figures in attendance. The Border Service of the National Council of the Church of Christ in China was officially established, with the first batch of personnel arriving in western Sichuan to set up service areas. In January 1940, the council appointed six pastors and evangelists for missions in southwestern China. In May, the second group of workers went to Xikang to establish a service area. The border service work included the following efforts: (1) Education: enhancing the cultural knowledge of border residents and eliminating ethnic barriers; (2) Health: alleviating the suffering of border residents and imparting health knowledge; (3) Livelihood: improving production and living conditions for the residents; (4) Women‚Äôs work: promoting maternal and child health and improving family life; (5) Relief: providing assistance during natural disasters and for particularly impoverished individuals; (6) Research: understanding local environments and the lives of border residents; (7) Religion: inspiring a spirit of service within workers and introducing the correct faith to border residents.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1944, the border service established a service area in Kunming, targeting the Miao people. After the victory in the War of Resistance, the National Council‚Äôs office relocated back to Shanghai, and the Border Service also moved its operations from Chengdu to Shanghai. After the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, the Border Service could not evade the political challenges of the broader situation, implementing the Three-Self principles (self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation), especially concerning personnel and finances, cutting ties with ‚Äúimperialism,‚Äù establishing a board of directors, and registering with government departments. As the campaign against Christianity unfolded, Zhang Bohuai also faced accusations regarding the border service‚Äôs connections with the National Government. Despite this, the Border Service continued to operate, but with the cessation of overseas assistance and a lack of funds, the ministry was significantly affected. The National Council recommended that all social service activities be taken over by the government; if the government was unwilling to take over, they sought to terminate operations. Between 1952 and 1953, services in the Xikang and western Sichuan areas were gradually handed over to the government.With the conclusion of the service area work, the headquarters of the Border Service in Chengdu also halted operations, ultimately disbanding in October 1955.</p>

<li>The Five Year Movement, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>In May 1929, the National Christian Council of China convened its seventh annual meeting in Hangzhou, where it decided to establish the ‚ÄúFive Year Evangelistic Movement Committee‚Äù to implement a five-year evangelistic plan. The purpose of this movement was to ‚Äúexpeditiously fulfill the mission of Christ, to develop a Christ-like life among believers, and to meet the urgent religious needs of the people.‚Äù The assembly suggested that the council unite various churches and Christian organizations, pooling all resources, either individually or collectively, to launch the Five Year Evangelistic Movement starting January 1 of the following year. The goals of the movement included: (1) cultivating a deeper knowledge of Christ among believers, ‚Äúintensifying fellowship,‚Äù and integrating Christ into all aspects of life with courageous spirit; (2) implementing an expanded evangelism effort, hoping to increase the number of current believers over the five-year period.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúFive Year Movement‚Äù became the focus of the council‚Äôs work and was promoted through seven areas of activity: (1) evangelism; (2) religious education; (3) Christian family life; (4) literacy campaigns and rural reconstruction; (5) work with the underprivileged; (6) youth programs; (7) Christian economic relationships.</p>

<li>Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs Baptism, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>On December 1, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek married Soong Mei-ling. Since the Soong family was Christian, Soong Ailing (Soong Ching-ling) and Soong Qing-ling‚Äôs husbands (Kong Xiangxi and Sun Yat-sen) were also Christians. As a result, Soong Guizhen required that any potential spouse for Soong Mei-ling be a Christian. Chiang later told Soong Guizhen, ‚ÄúIf I am to become a Christian, I must truly have faith, not simply because I want to marry your daughter. I promise you that from today, I will sincerely start reading the Bible.‚Äù Thus, Soong Guizhen agreed to their marriage. However, since Chiang had not yet been baptized, their wedding did not take place under Christian rites.</p>
<p>On October 23, 1930, Chiang Kai-shek was baptized at the Soong family home in Shanghai‚Äôs French Concession, officiated by Pastor Jiang Changchuan of the Methodist Church, with only Soong Mei-ling, Soong Ziwen, and a few friends present as witnesses. On October 25, the Beijing newspaper ‚ÄúYishibao‚Äù reported, ‚ÄúChiang returned from the road yesterday and received baptism, drawing attention from all sides.‚Äù On October 26, the ‚ÄúShengjing Daily‚Äù reported, ‚ÄúChiang Kai-shek has indeed been baptized as a Christian,‚Äù stating that his conversion was influenced by ‚Äúthe passionate persuasion of Miss Soong Mei-ling and her family.‚Äù The ‚ÄúDagong Daily‚Äù reported on October 25, stating, ‚ÄúChiang‚Äôs entry into Christianity is of significant concern to outsiders‚Äù and noted that his baptism was ‚Äúpreviously kept a secret,‚Äù describing the reaction in Beijing and Shanghai as quite surprising and indicating that it would have profound implications for the future of the Chinese government.</p>

<li>National Christian Literacy Movement Seminar, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>From April 24 to May 10, 1930, the National Christian Council of China held a seminar on the National Christian Literacy Movement in Ding County, Hebei Province, attended by over 90 representatives from 11 provinces and nine denominations. The seminar was held there because of the success achieved by Yan Panchu‚Äôs China Popular Education Promotion Association in the area, where the local Congregational Church had also initiated a rural literacy movement early on. During the seminar, representatives visited various educational initiatives run by local churches, with Yan Yangchu explaining how to approach popular education with a focus on ‚Äúattacking ignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness.‚Äù The aim was to encourage churches to hold various training sessions or summer schools to cultivate talent in popular education.</p>
<p>After the seminar, coinciding with the council‚Äôs ‚ÄúFive Year Movement,‚Äù literacy initiatives began to be incorporated into their work. Various local churches organized different seminars to follow up on how to implement literacy programs. From April 7 to 20, 1933, the council held a discussion on the second generation of literacy movement and rural construction in Ding County, focusing on ‚ÄúWhat Contributions should Christianity Make to Rural Development?‚Äù Representatives from 14 provinces and 18 church organizations attended, totaling 186 people (150 nationals and 36 missionaries). During the meeting, Yan Yangchu delivered speeches on ‚Äúhow to conduct popular education,‚Äù ‚Äútransforming society must first transform hearts,‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat contributions Christianity should make to rural construction.‚Äù He specifically emphasized that the church should not remain fixed in traditional approaches, but instead adopt new methods to engage the public, advocating for the church to focus on living conditions rather than merely preaching, embodying the spirit of Christian love and scientific improvement to transform rural areas.The work of the Student Relief Committee primarily targeted the first category of students. The committee focused on fundraising domestically and abroad to support students through several initiatives: (1) establishing work-study positions to provide part-time job opportunities and prevent students from dropping out; (2) providing subsidies for refugee students to return to their hometowns or transfer inland for studies; (3) arranging dormitories for both refugee students and those studying in the rear areas, organizing various activities; (4) arranging short-term jobs for temporarily displaced students.

<p>On December 1, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek married Soong Mei-ling. Since the Soong family was Christian, Soong Ailing and Soong Qing-ling‚Äôs husbands (Kong Xiangxi and Sun Yat-sen) were also Christians. As a result, Soong Guizhen required that any potential spouse for Soong Mei-ling be a Christian. Chiang later told Soong Guizhen, ‚ÄúIf I am to become a Christian, I must truly have faith, not simply because I want to marry your daughter. I promise you that from today, I will sincerely start reading the Bible.‚Äù Thus, Soong Guizhen agreed to their marriage. However, since Chiang had not yet been baptized, their wedding did not take place under Christian rites.</p>
<p>On October 23, 1930, Chiang Kai-shek was baptized at the Soong family home in Shanghai‚Äôs French Concession, officiated by Pastor Jiang Changchuan of the Methodist Church, with only Soong Mei-ling, Soong Ziwen, and a few friends present as witnesses. On October 25, the Beijing newspaper ‚ÄúYishibao‚Äù reported, ‚ÄúChiang returned from the road yesterday and received baptism, drawing attention from all sides.‚Äù On October 26, the ‚ÄúShengjing Daily‚Äù reported, ‚ÄúChiang Kai-shek has indeed been baptized as a Christian,‚Äù stating that his conversion was influenced by ‚Äúthe passionate persuasion of Miss Soong Mei-ling and her family.‚Äù The ‚ÄúDagong Daily‚Äù reported on October 25, stating, ‚ÄúChiang‚Äôs entry into Christianity is of significant concern to outsiders‚Äù and noted that his baptism was ‚Äúpreviously kept a secret,‚Äù describing the reaction in Beijing and Shanghai as quite surprising and indicating that it would have profound implications for the future of the Chinese government.</p>

<li>National Christian Literacy Movement Seminar, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>From April 24 to May 10, 1930, the National Christian Council of China held a seminar on the National Christian Literacy Movement in Ding County, Hebei Province, attended by over 90 representatives from 11 provinces and nine denominations. The seminar was held there because of the success achieved by Yan Panchu‚Äôs China Popular Education Promotion Association in the area, where the local Congregational Church had also initiated a rural literacy movement early on. During the seminar, representatives visited various educational initiatives run by local churches, with Yan Yangchu explaining how to approach popular education with a focus on ‚Äúattacking ignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness.‚Äù The aim was to encourage churches to hold various training sessions or summer schools to cultivate talent in popular education.</p>
<p>After the seminar, coinciding with the council‚Äôs ‚ÄúFive Year Movement,‚Äù literacy initiatives began to be incorporated into their work. Various local churches organized different seminars to follow up on how to implement literacy programs. From April 7 to 20, 1933, the council held a discussion on the second generation of literacy movement and rural construction in Ding County, focusing on ‚ÄúWhat Contributions should Christianity Make to Rural Development?‚Äù Representatives from 14 provinces and 18 church organizations attended, totaling 186 people (150 nationals and 36 missionaries). During the meeting, Yan Yangchu delivered speeches on ‚Äúhow to conduct popular education,‚Äù ‚Äútransforming society must first transform hearts,‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat contributions Christianity should make to rural construction.‚Äù He specifically emphasized that the church should not remain fixed in traditional approaches, but instead adopt new methods to engage the public, advocating for the church to focus on living conditions rather than merely preaching, embodying the spirit of Christian love and scientific improvement to transform rural areas.</p>

<li>Lichuan Experiment Project, 1934</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the 1920s, various reconstruction movements for rural areas began across China. By 1934, there were 691 public and private organizations engaged in rural reconstruction activities. In 1930, the Chinese Communist Party established a temporary Soviet in Jiangxi, but by 1934, the Kuomintang‚Äôs ‚Äúextermination campaign‚Äù began to drive the Communist Party out of Jiangxi. During the Communist leadership, there had been initiatives for land reform in the region, and the National Government aimed to eradicate the ‚Äúpoison‚Äù of communism through rural reconstruction efforts, prompting the start of rural service work in Jiangxi. In June 1934, the National Economic Commission established an office in Jiangxi and devised plans for new construction. The Jiangxi provincial government invited two experts (Pan Ji and a doctoral graduate from Cornell University) to lead the provincial health department and the agriculture institute to work in conjunction with the Jiangxi office. At the request of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Fuliang, the rural services director for the National Christian Council, agreed to serve as a technical consultant for the Jiangxi office. Zhang, who had studied in the U.S. and held master‚Äôs degrees in forestry and agriculture, brought seven years of rural work experience. In July, the National Economic Commission established 10 rural service areas throughout Jiangxi Province. In March 1935, the Jiangxi office reorganized into the ‚ÄúManagement Office of Jiangxi Rural Service Area of the National Economic Commission,‚Äù with Zhang Fuliang appointed as commissioner.</p>
<p>As early as the summer of 1933, Soong Mei-ling had expressed to missionary William R. Johnson that the government would implement a rural reconstruction experiment in the recovered areas of Jiangxi. In August, a group of missionaries convened a retreat in Guling and invited Soong Mei-ling to attend. She reiterated her desire for the church to participate in rural service in Jiangxi. The Christian Council sent Zhang Fuliang to Jiangxi for further investigation (later, Zhang was called to work for the Jiangxi office of the government).The Student Relief Committee‚Äôs work was primarily targeted at the first category of students. It focused on fundraising both domestically and internationally to support students through various initiatives: (1) establishing work-study positions to provide opportunities for students to work and study simultaneously, preventing them from dropping out; (2) offering subsidies to allow refugee students to return to their original homes or transfer inland for their studies; (3) providing accommodations for both refugee students and those studying in the rear areas, as well as organizing activities; (4) arranging short-term employment for temporarily displaced students. Funding for these support initiatives mainly came from international sources, such as the International Student Service, the Far-East Student Emergency Fund, and the Far-East Student Service Fund.</p>
<p>To aid refugee students, the Student Relief Committee established ‚ÄúChristian Student Service Centers‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúChristian Student Communities‚Äù) at national universities in remote areas, while also serving local church colleges. By 1943, a total of 12 student service centers or communities had been created: (1) Chenggu, Shaanxi (Northwest United University and Northwest Normal University); (2) Jiading, Sichuan (Wuhan University and Central Polytechnic School); (3) Shapingba, Chongqing (Central University, Chongqing University, Sichuan Normal University, and Nankai Middle School); (4) Zunyi and Meitan in Guizhou (Zhejiang University); (5) Liangfeng, Guangxi (Guangxi University); (6) Pingshi, Guangdong (Sun Yat-sen University); (7) Guizhou from Guangxi (Guangdong Provincial Arts and Sciences College); (8) Shapingba in Chengdu (West China University, Jinling University, Qilu University, and Jinling Women‚Äôs College); (9) Majiabao in Hanzhong (Northwest Medical University); (10) San Tai, Sichuan (Northeast University); (11) Kunming, Yunnan (Southwest United University, Yunnan University); (12) Gulu Ba, Shaanxi (Northwest Institute of Technology).</p>
<p>The student service centers (or communities) primarily provided a space for collective activities where students could sing, play games, study, discuss various life issues, and even receive vocational training. Due to the limitations imposed by the wartime university environment, these service centers became the main venues for leisure and activities for students. Each service center or community had student officers responsible for managing its activities, allowing students to take initiative and develop a spirit of service.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, as universities began to relocate back to their original locations, the student communities continued to serve students at various universities. The National Committee for Religious Work among Government University Students was revised and renamed the National Committee for Religious Work among University Students.</p>
<p>By 1949, eight student communities remained active nationwide, located at Tsinghua University in Beiping, Northeast University in Shenyang, Jinling Women‚Äôs University in Nanjing, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the Student Community at Lake Luojia in Wuchang, the Student Community in Chongqing, and the Student Community in Chengdu.</p>
<p>From the War of Resistance to the post-war period, these student communities also became targets for infiltration by the underground Communist Party. A notable example is the underground pastor Li Chuwen, who was involved in leading student service activities during the war in Kunming.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>National Federation of Student Christian Unions, 1939</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chinese Christian Student Movement began in 1922 during the 11th assembly of the World Student Christian Federation, held in Beijing, where a proposal was passed to establish a Christian student movement in China. This initiative was subsequently organized through cooperation between the YMCA and YWCA, alongside student volunteer evangelistic efforts. Based on local YMCA groups and student fellowships, the Preparatory Committee for the Chinese Christian Student Movement was formed in July 1927 at Jinling Women‚Äôs University in Nanjing. The committee established its movement goals as ‚Äúguided by the spirit of Jesus, forming youth fellowships, building healthy personalities, and advocating for the liberation and development of the people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù Originally, there was an intention to include ‚Äúto carry out revolution‚Äù within the goals, but this was later removed by student leaders who viewed the term ‚ÄúNational Revolution‚Äù as easily reducible to a clich√©.</p>
<p>In 1933, the committee held a national fellowship conference at Hujiang University in Shanghai, leading to the formation of the temporary national governing body of the Chinese Christian Student Movement, referred to as the ‚ÄúTemporary Assembly.‚Äù Plans for the official establishment of the Chinese Christian Student Movement were set for 1936. However, due to the ongoing war, these plans were postponed until 1939.</p>
<p>Notably, the ‚ÄúDeclaration of the National Christian Student Representative Conference‚Äù in 1939 reiterated the vision for rescuing and constructing the nation, emphasizing that the church should provide education and programs to train leaders while advocating the importance of literacy efforts for the rural church. Through such initiatives, the Christian church aimed to play a vital role in the reconstruction of society during a time of crisis.The work of the Student Relief Committee was primarily focused on the first category of students, and it aimed to raise funds both domestically and internationally to assist them through various initiatives: (1) establishing work-study positions to provide part-time job opportunities, enabling students to continue their education without interruption; (2) offering subsidies to help refugee students return to their hometowns or relocate inland for their studies; (3) arranging accommodation for both refugee students and those studying in the rear areas, as well as organizing community activities; (4) providing temporary employment for students who had to pause their education. The funding for these support efforts mainly came from abroad, such as from the International Student Service, the Far-East Student Emergency Fund, and the Far-East Student Service Fund.</p>
<p>To specifically assist the refugee students, the Student Relief Committee established ‚ÄúChristian Student Service Centers‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúChristian Student Communities‚Äù) at national universities in remote areas, while also supporting local church colleges.

<p>Under the encouragement of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Fuliang, an executive member of the National Christian Council‚Äôs rural work department, agreed to serve as a technical consultant for the Jiangxi office. Zhang had studied in the United States, earning master‚Äôs degrees in forestry and agriculture, and possessed seven years of rural working experience.

<p>In 1934, the work undertaken by the National Christian Council‚Äôs Border Service was aimed at community health initiatives, educational outreach, and economic development in rural settings. However, facing numerous challenges, including difficulties in recruitment and the need for skilled professionals, the program struggled to maintain momentum. Issues of cooperation and theological disagreements also emerged within the broader context of the church‚Äôs engagement with the state during this period.The committee members not only organized the distribution of supplies but also actively rescued victims. They sheltered a large number of civilians, with estimates suggesting that the safety zone could accommodate up to 250,000 people at its peak.</p>
<p>On December 13, 1937, Japanese forces captured the National Government‚Äôs capital of Nanjing and carried out brutal massacres. The Japanese military forcibly invaded the safety zone, looted property, raped women, and rounded up and killed young men. The International Committee protested multiple times to the Japanese embassy and military authorities, demanding protection for the safety zone according to international conventions; however, the atrocities committed by the Japanese military did not cease.</p>
<p>While the efforts of the Nanjing International Safety Zone Committee could not completely halt the Japanese military‚Äôs brutality, they saved hundreds of thousands of lives during the Nanjing Massacre and morally condemned the aggressive actions of the Japanese. More importantly, the records kept by the committee members became crucial evidence for revealing the Nanjing Massacre in the future, providing firsthand information for the international community to understand this historical event.</p>

<li>The YMCA Leaders‚Äô Journey to Yan‚Äôan, 1939</li>
</ol>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the National Association of the YMCA shifted its focus westward and established branches in the southwestern regions of Guilin and Guiyang. In March 1939, National Association General Secretary Liang Xiaochu decided to conduct an investigation in the northwest to explore the possibility of ministry work in that region and to assess the situation of refugee students on behalf of the National Student Relief Committee. Thus, a delegation was formed, including Liang Xiaochu, George A. Fitch (the Deputy General Secretary of the YMCA‚Äôs Soldiers‚Äô Service Department), and Jiang Wenhan.</p>
<p>In June 1939, while the three were discussing their plans for the northwest in Xi‚Äôan, Liang initially hesitated about visiting Yan‚Äôan, being the base of the Communist Party, fearing it could lead to misunderstandings from outside observers. However, the Eighth Route Army‚Äôs office in Xi‚Äôan offered to prepare vehicles and arrange for them to travel to Yan‚Äôan together with Zhou Enlai, thus they set off on June 23. They arrived in Yan‚Äôan on June 25 and were received by Jin Cheng, head of the Communications Department of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region.</p>
<p>During their three-day stay in Yan‚Äôan, they visited the border region government, where they were welcomed by Vice Chairman Gao Zili, who introduced them to the regional situation, particularly the large-scale land reclamation movement. Additionally, they toured the Anti-Japanese University, Women‚Äôs University, and the Lu Xun Academy of Arts to understand the possibilities of developing student relief initiatives in the future. Ultimately, they visited the United Office of the Northwestern Youth Salvation Organization led by the Communist Party to discuss the potential of establishing a YMCA in Yan‚Äôan.</p>
<p>During their visit, they had the opportunity to meet with Mao Zedong and spoke for nearly two hours. Mao discussed issues related to resistance against Japan and post-war reconstruction, as well as the Communist Party‚Äôs religious policies. He expressed that the Communist Party upholds the principle of religious freedom and that no one should be forced to believe or disbelieve in a religion. Mao acknowledged that the Communist Party had previously made mistakes concerning religious issues but had corrected them. As long as one did not oppose the government, religion would be permitted. Under the united front, Christians and Communist Party members could be friends and stand together against Japan.</p>
<p>Jiang Wenhan later wrote a report titled ‚ÄúA Pilgrimage to Yan‚Äôan,‚Äù reflecting his positive impressions of the trip. However, the plan to establish a YMCA in Yan‚Äôan ultimately did not materialize due to objections from Kong Xiangxi. Nevertheless, the YMCA was able to provide funding to support the student relief work in Yan‚Äôan through Zhou Enlai‚Äôs residence at the Jiangyan Compound in Chongqing, assisting the local government in establishing the ‚ÄúInternational Student Sanatorium.‚Äù</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>The Fundamentalist Movement and Spiritual Movement in China</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1929, members of the North China Presbyterian Assembly initiated the establishment of the ‚ÄúLeague of Christian Churches,‚Äù and in December of that year, they convened a meeting where it was unanimously decided not to join the Chinese Christian Church, which was comprised of the Presbyterian, Congregational, and London Missionary societies, and to instead organize the Christian League. In early 1930, the league announced its five main tenets: (1) belief in the scriptures of the Old and New Testament as inspired by the Holy Spirit, which serve as the sole and complete standard for our faith and duty; (2) acknowledgment of the Apostles‚Äô Creed as consistent with the essentials of the scriptures; (3) belief in the one true God, existing in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who are of the same essence, power, and glory; (4) a confession of faith in Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit, having a complete human nature, living a life in accordance with the gospels, who died for mankind‚Äôs sins, was resurrected, ascended to heaven, and shall return to judge the living and the dead; and (5) recognition that the Church consists of those who are regenerated by the Holy Spirit and saved through faith in Jesus Christ, as integral members of the body of Christ.</p>
<p>Soon, individual denominations such as the Evangelical Church, Lutheran Church, China Inland Mission, and the Wesleyan Church, along with prominent Chinese church leaders like Yang Shaotang, Jia Yuming, and Ding Limei joined the movement, with Jia Yuming being elected as the chairman.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, several fundamentalist figures emerged within the Chinese church, including Jia Yuming, Chen Chonggui, Yang Shaotang, Wang Mingdao, Ni Tuosheng, Li Yuanru, Wang Peizhen, Ding Limei, Cheng Jiguang, Wang Zai, Ji Zhiwen, Song Shangjie, Jiao Weizhen, Yu Cidu, Zhang Xuegong, Gao Shizhu, Zhao Liutang, Huang Yuansu, Zhao Shiguang, and Zhao Junying.</p>
<p>The term ‚Äúfundamentalist‚Äù was not widely embraced among Chinese churches in the early 20th century. While it was used among missionaries in China to describe ‚Äúfundamentalism,‚Äù Chinese believers more commonly referred to themselves as ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù or ‚Äúconservative.‚Äù The reason for the lack of popularity of the term ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù in Chinese churches is primarily that conservative individuals within these churches did not possess the same strong sense of self-identity as those in the American fundamentalist camp. In fact, the term ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù originated in the United States and was subsequently introduced to various missionary fields by North American missionaries. For those who viewed liberal theology as their primary adversary, ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù became a central identity marker, creating a clear division between ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem.‚Äù In contrast, while the Chinese church shared theological traditions similar to North American fundamentalism, many Chinese clergy did not necessarily possess the same self-awareness or use ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù as a unifying symbol.</p>
<p>Another reason for the term ‚Äúfundamentalist‚Äù not being commonly used among Chinese pastors relates to issues of theological orthodoxy. The rise of fundamentalism in North America was deeply rooted in a historical background of orthodox Christian doctrine. Many fundamentalist figures had received formal theological training and thoroughly understood the ‚Äúessential beliefs‚Äù they defended. In contrast, many Chinese pastors had not delved deeply into systemic doctrinal issues; they recognized the opposition between old and new theology amid hot disputes among missionaries, but they were less equipped to engage with certain technical theological questions that constituted the debates. Opposition to liberal theology among Chinese believers often stemmed more from a reaction against perceived ‚Äúunspirituality‚Äù than solely a desire to uphold fundamental doctrines.</p>
<p>The term ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù was not prevalent in China, but this did not indicate that the Chinese church lacked a desire to combat liberal theology. For many who opposed modernist views, they identified more with being ‚Äúspiritual.‚Äù The origin of the term ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù remains difficult to trace; it may be related to the publication of ‚ÄúThe Spiritual Man‚Äù by Ni Tuosheng in 1928, which gained significant popularity among believers. The influential theological discourse of trichotomy (spirit, soul, and body) within this work had a profound impact on the Chinese church. As noted by Liang Jialin, Ni‚Äôs greatest influence on the Chinese church was his creation and compilation of widely used ‚Äúspiritual vocabulary.‚Äù Many Chinese believers distinguished themselves from modernists primarily through the lens of ‚Äúspirituality.‚ÄùThe work of the Student Relief Committee primarily targeted the first category of students. It focused on raising funds both domestically and internationally to support students through various initiatives: (1) establishing work-study positions to provide opportunities for students to work while studying, thus preventing them from dropping out; (2) offering subsidies to refugee students to assist them in returning to their homes or relocating inland for studies; (3) arranging accommodations for both refugee students and those attending schools in the rear areas, as well as organizing community activities; (4) providing temporary jobs for students who had to pause their education. Funding for these support efforts mainly came from foreign sources such as the International Student Service, the Far-East Student Emergency Fund, and the Far-East Student Service Fund.</p>
<p>To aid refugee students, the Student Relief Committee established ‚ÄúChristian Student Service Centers‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúChristian Student Communities‚Äù) at national universities in remote areas while also supporting local church colleges. By 1943, a total of 12 student service centers or communities had been established: (1) Chenggu, Shaanxi (Northwest United University and Northwest Normal University); (2) Jiading, Sichuan (Wuhan University and Central Polytechnic School); (3) Shapingba, Chongqing (Central University, Chongqing University, Sichuan Normal University, and Nankai Middle School); (4) Zunyi and Meitan in Guizhou (Zhejiang University); (5) Liangfeng, Guangxi (Guangxi University); (6) Pingshi, Guangdong (Sun Yat-sen University); (7) Guizhou from Guangxi (Guangdong Provincial Arts and Sciences College); (8) Shapingba in Chengdu (West China University, Jinling University, Qilu University, and Jinling Women‚Äôs College); (9) Majiabao in Hanzhong (Northwest Medical University); (10) San Tai, Sichuan (Northeast University); (11) Kunming, Yunnan (Southwest United University and Yunnan University); (12) Gulu Ba, Shaanxi (Northwest Institute of Technology).</p>
<p>The student service centers (or communities) provided spaces for collective activities where students could sing, play games, study, discuss various life issues, and receive vocational training. Given the environmental limitations imposed by wartime conditions, these centers became the primary leisure and activity hubs for students. Each center had student officials responsible for their functions, which empowered students to take initiative and cultivate a spirit of service.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, as many universities returned to their original locations, the student communities continued to support students across various campuses. The National Committee for Religious Work among Government University Students was restructured and renamed the National Committee for Religious Work among University Students.</p>
<p>By 1949, eight student communities remained active, located at Tsinghua University in Beiping, Northeast University in Shenyang, Jinling Women‚Äôs University in Nanjing, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the Student Community at Lake Luojia in Wuchang, the Student Community in Chongqing, and the Student Community in Chengdu.</p>
<p>From the War of Resistance to the post-war period, these student communities became focal points for infiltration by underground Communist Party elements. A notable example is the underground pastor Li Chuwen, who played a significant role in leading student service activities during the war in Kunming.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>The National Federation of Student Christian Unions, 1939</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chinese Christian Student Movement began to take shape in 1922 during the 11th assembly of the World Student Christian Federation held in Beijing, where a proposal was passed to establish a Christian student movement in China. This initiative was achieved through collaboration between the YMCA and YWCA, alongside student volunteer evangelistic movements. Based on local school YMCA groups and student fellowships, the Preparatory Committee for the Chinese Christian Student Movement was established in July 1927 at Jinling Women‚Äôs University in Nanjing. The committee defined its movement goals as ‚Äúinspired by the spirit of Jesus, creating youth fellowships, establishing sound personalities, and advocating for the liberation and development of people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù Originally, there was an intent to include ‚Äúto carry out revolution‚Äù within these goals, but this was later removed by student leaders, who felt that the term ‚ÄúNational Revolution‚Äù could easily devolve into a clich√©.</p>
<p>In 1933, the committee held a national fellowship conference at Hujiang University in Shanghai, leading to the formation of the Chinese Christian Student Movement‚Äôs Temporary National Assembly (referred to as the ‚ÄúTemporary Assembly‚Äù). Plans for the official establishment of the Chinese Christian Student Movement were projected for 1936, but these plans were postponed due to the ongoing war until 1939.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>The Lichuan Experiment Project, 1934</li>
</ol>
<p>By the late 1920s, rural reconstruction movements began to emerge across China. By 1934, records indicated that there were 691 organizations engaged in rural development activities throughout the country. In 1930, the Chinese Communist Party established a temporary Soviet in Jiangxi, but by 1934, the Kuomintang‚Äôs ‚Äúextermination campaign‚Äù began to drive the Communists out of Jiangxi. During the Communist governance, there had been initiatives for land reform in the region. The National Government sought to eradicate the ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù of communism through rural reconstruction efforts, initiating rural service work in Jiangxi. In June 1934, the National Economic Commission established an office in Jiangxi to implement plans for new constructions. The Jiangxi provincial government invited two experts (one a Harvard graduate and the other a Cornell doctoral graduate) to lead the provincial health department and agriculture institute in partnership with the Jiangxi office.</p>
<p>With encouragement from Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Fuliang, an executive member from the National Christian Council‚Äôs rural work department, agreed to become a technical consultant for the Jiangxi office. Zhang, who had studied in the U.S. and received master‚Äôs degrees in forestry and agriculture, had seven years of rural working experience. In July, the National Economic Commission established ten rural service areas across Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1933, Soong Mei-ling had expressed to missionary William R. Johnson her desire for the government to implement rural reconstruction experiments in the reclaimed regions of Jiangxi. A group of missionaries convened a retreat in Guling and invited Soong Mei-ling to attend. She reiterated her eagerness for the church to engage in rural construction efforts in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>In 1934, rural service efforts commenced in Lichuan County, led by Christian organizations, but did not fall under the ten government-established rural service areas. The first general secretary was George Shepherd, an American Congregationalist missionary from the Minbei area, who initially recruited more than ten young people from various countries to join the service work. However, cooperation among them proved challenging. Due to the underdeveloped environment and inadequate wages, it was difficult to attract qualified professionals in fields like medicine and agriculture. Even those who arrived with ideals soon became disillusioned by the prevailing reality. The high turnover among staff significantly impacted the progress of the program.</p>
<p>At the same time, some members of the Christian Council began to question the initiative, particularly criticizing its lack of religious activities, arguing that it had become purely a social welfare program. Zhang Fuliang, however, viewed the project as fundamentally a religious initiative, as religion encompasses the entirety of life. He advocated for serving rural communities with the spirit of Jesus to build a Christianized rural society, contrasting with some church leaders who perceived the program merely as an evangelistic tool.</p>
<p>In an effort to strengthen collaboration with the government, Zhang Fuliang pushed for alignment with government agendas. In 1936, he coordinated with authorities, and one of his colleagues was appointed as a district chief by the provincial government. The Lichuan experiment area was also incorporated into the provincial government‚Äôs rural improvement initiative. However, the relationship between the program and the government raised suspicions within church circles. In 1937, Zhang Fuliang resigned due to disagreements with the council. After Soong Mei-ling‚Äôs five-year funding period ended, additional support was not provided, leading the experiment to end in failure.</p>

<li>The Christian Farmer, 1934</li>
</ol>
<p>In August 1934, ‚ÄúThe Christian Farmer,‚Äù edited by Liu Tingfang, was published by the North China Christian Agricultural Development Association. The editorial team responsible was centered at Qilu University in Shandong, with Zhang Xueyan being a key figure, serving as deputy editor, editor-in-chief, and president of the association. ‚ÄúThe Christian Farmer‚Äù was one of the earliest popular publications in China aimed at rural audiences, intended to promote scientific culture and improve farmers‚Äô literacy.</p>
<p>The publication included sections such as ‚ÄúOpinions,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommon Sense,‚Äù ‚ÄúLiterature,‚Äù ‚ÄúReligion,‚Äù ‚ÄúLivelihood Supplement,‚Äù ‚ÄúHealth Supplement,‚Äù ‚ÄúFamily Supplement,‚Äù and ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Supplement.‚Äù It notably employed language similar to that found in ‚ÄúThe Farmer‚Äôs Thousand-Character Course‚Äù published by the China Popular Education Promotion Association, incorporating phonetic annotations to assist reader understanding. Its publication aligned with the promotion of the Christian rural reconstruction movement of the time.</p>
<p>During the wartime period, the editorial work of ‚ÄúThe Christian Farmer‚Äù followed Qilu University as it relocated to the rear areas (moving to Changsha in October 1937, and to Chengdu in September 1938), continuing publication without interruption amid the war. The magazine featured numerous articles urging the public to resist Japan and save the nation. Zhang Xueyan personally wrote articles like ‚ÄúThe Unshakeable Dignity and Confidence of the Chinese Nation,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Voice of Justice,‚Äù and others, calling for widespread unity against external threats to achieve ultimate victory. After the victory over Japan, he continued to write encouraging the cessation of internal conflict, emphasizing the importance of ‚ÄúPeace First, Nation Building First, Democracy First, Freedom First.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Christian Farmer‚Äù enjoyed a warm reception among readers, with 8,000 subscribers at its one-year anniversary, distributed across the country. Before the war, circulation increased to 50,000, and in March 1941, circulation still reached 15,000. By 1942, subscriptions grew to 35,000. By November 1944, the publication continued to flourish.(1) The Five Year Evangelistic Movement, 1930</p>
<p>In May 1929, the National Christian Council of China held its seventh annual meeting in Hangzhou, where it resolved to establish the ‚ÄúFive Year Evangelistic Movement Committee‚Äù to implement a five-year evangelistic plan. The purpose was to ‚Äúexpeditiously fulfill the mission of Christ, develop a Christ-like life among believers, and meet the urgent spiritual needs of the people.‚Äù The council suggested uniting various churches and Christian organizations to pool resources for this movement, commencing on January 1 of the following year. Goals included: (1) fostering a deeper knowledge of Christ among believers and intensifying fellowship in a courageous spirit; (2) expanding evangelization efforts with the hope of significantly increasing the number of current believers within five years.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúFive Year Movement‚Äù became the central focus of the council‚Äôs work, promoting initiatives in seven areas: (1) evangelism; (2) religious education; (3) Christian family life; (4) literacy campaigns and rural reconstruction; (5) outreach to the marginalized; (6) youth programs; (7) Christian economic relationships.</p>

<li>Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs Baptism, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>On December 1, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek married Soong Mei-ling. The Soong family, rooted in Christianity, had members whose husbands‚ÄîSoong Ailing and Soong Ching-ling‚Äîwere also Christians. Consequently, Soong Guizhen insisted that any potential husband for Soong Mei-ling must be a Christian. Chiang told Soong Guizhen that, ‚ÄúIf I am to become a Christian, I must truly have faith, and it cannot merely be because I wish to marry your daughter. I promise to start reading the Bible sincerely from today.‚Äù With this assurance, Soong Guizhen consented to their marriage. Since Chiang had not yet been baptized, the wedding could not be conducted under Christian rites.</p>
<p>On October 23, 1930, Chiang Kai-shek was baptized at the Soong family residence in Shanghai‚Äôs French Concession, officiated by Pastor Jiang Changchuan from the Methodist Church, with only Soong Mei-ling, Soong Ziwen, and a few close friends present. On October 25, the Beijing newspaper ‚ÄúYishibao‚Äù reported on this event, drawing significant attention. The ‚ÄúShengjing Daily‚Äù echoed the news on October 26, mentioning that Chiang‚Äôs conversion was heavily influenced by Soong Mei-ling and her family‚Äôs encouragement. The ‚ÄúDagong Daily‚Äù remarked that Chiang‚Äôs entry into Christianity was of considerable interest to outsiders, highlighting the secrecy surrounding his baptism and the subsequent surprise in Beijing and Shanghai that it could have profound implications for the governance of China.</p>

<li>National Christian Literacy Movement Seminar, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>From April 24 to May 10, 1930, the National Christian Council of China held a seminar on the National Christian Literacy Movement in Ding County, Hebei Province, with over 90 representatives from 11 provinces and nine denominations attending. The seminar was chosen to be held in Ding County due to the successful efforts of Yan Panchu‚Äôs China Popular Education Promotion Association, where the local Congregational Church had begun a rural literacy movement. Representatives attended different church-run educational initiatives and were educated by Yan Yangchu on utilizing popular education strategies focused on addressing ignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness. This aimed to encourage churches to conduct various training programs and summer schools to cultivate talent in popular education.</p>
<p>Following the seminar and coinciding with the council‚Äôs ‚ÄúFive Year Movement,‚Äù literacy initiatives were integrated into their programs. Local churches organized additional seminars to follow up on implementing literacy efforts. From April 7 to 20, 1933, the council convened a discussion on a second generation of literacy initiatives and rural construction, focusing on how Christianity could contribute to rural development. Representatives from 14 provinces and 18 church organizations attended, totaling 186 individuals (150 Chinese nationals and 36 missionaries). Yan delivered addresses on how to carry out popular education, emphasizing that society could not be transformed without transforming hearts first, and what contributions Christianity should make to rural development. He particularly stressed that churches needed to adopt new strategies to engage citizens, concentrating on the practical living conditions rather than purely preaching, embodying the spirit of Christian love and scientific improvement in rural areas.</p>

<li>The Lichuan Experiment Project, 1934</li>
</ol>
<p>In the late 1920s, various rural reconstruction movements began emerging across China. By 1934, records revealed 691 organizations participating in rural development efforts. The Chinese Communist Party established a temporary Soviet in Jiangxi in 1930, but by 1934, the Kuomintang‚Äôs ‚Äúextermination campaign‚Äù began to expel Communists from the region. During the Communist governance, land reform initiatives had been enacted, with the National Government aiming to eliminate the ‚Äúinfluences‚Äù of communism through rural reconstruction. In June 1934, the National Economic Commission set up an office in Jiangxi to implement plans for new construction. The Jiangxi provincial government invited two experts, one a Harvard alumnus and the other a Cornell University doctoral graduate, to lead the provincial health department and agriculture institute in cooperation with the Jiangxi office.</p>
<p>At the encouragement of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Fuliang, an executive member of the National Christian Council‚Äôs rural work department, agreed to serve as a consultant for the Jiangxi office. Zhang, who had earned master‚Äôs degrees in forestry and agriculture in the United States, brought with him seven years of rural work experience. By July, the National Economic Commission had established ten rural service areas throughout Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1933, Soong Mei-ling had expressed to missionary William R. Johnson her expectations for the government to implement rural reconstruction initiatives in recovered areas of Jiangxi. In August, a group of missionaries gathered for a retreat in Guling and invited Soong Mei-ling to attend, during which she reaffirmed her desire for the church to participate in rural service in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>With the establishment of this project in Lichuan, the Church took the lead, separate from the ten government-established service areas. The first general secretary was George Shepherd, an American Congregationalist missionary from Minbei, who initially recruited over ten young workers from various countries to join the service mission. However, collaboration proved challenging. Due to underdeveloped conditions and inadequate compensation, recruiting qualified professionals‚Äîlike medical and agricultural experts‚Äîwas difficult, leading many idealistic volunteers to become disillusioned with the reality. Consequently, the turnover rate among staff was quite high, severely impacting progress.</p>
<p>Some members of the Christian Council began expressing doubts about the project, particularly pointing out its lack of religious activities, arguing it had devolved into a mere social welfare initiative. Zhang Fuliang, however, viewed the project as a fundamentally religious initiative that encompassed the entirety of life. He believed in the mission of serving rural communities under the spirit of Jesus to build a Christianized rural society, contrasting with some church leaders treating it simply as an evangelism tool.</p>
<p>In an effort to strengthen collaboration with the government, Zhang pushed to align with government initiatives. In 1936, he fortified ties with the authorities, leading to one of his colleagues being appointed as a district chief by the provincial government, and the Lichuan experiment area was incorporated into the provincial government‚Äôs rural improvement projects. However, this partnership raised suspicions within church circles. In 1937, Zhang Fuliang resigned due to disagreements with the council, and after Soong Mei-ling‚Äôs five-year funding period ended, support for the project was not renewed, ultimately leading to its failure.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Christian Farmer‚Äù gained popularity among readers, with 8,000 subscribers noted in its first year. By the pre-war period, the circulation increased to 50,000, and in March 1941, it maintained a distribution of 15,000. By 1942, subscriptions grew to 35,000 and continued to thrive in the following years.The Student Relief Committee‚Äôs work focused primarily on the first category of students, aimed at raising funds both domestically and internationally to support them through various initiatives: (1) establishing work-study opportunities to provide part-time jobs, thus preventing students from dropping out; (2) offering subsidies to help refugee students return to their hometowns or transfer inland for education; (3) arranging accommodations for both refugee students and those studying in the rear areas, as well as organizing activities; (4) providing short-term employment for students temporarily out of school. Funding for these efforts primarily came from international sources, such as the International Student Service, the Far-East Student Emergency Fund, and the Far-East Student Service Fund.</p>
<p>To cater to the needs of refugee students, the Student Relief Committee established ‚ÄúChristian Student Service Centers‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúChristian Student Communities‚Äù) at national universities in remote areas, while also serving local church colleges. By 1943, a total of 12 student service centers or communities had been created: (1) Chenggu, Shaanxi (Northwest United University and Northwest Normal University); (2) Jiading, Sichuan (Wuhan University and Central Polytechnic School); (3) Shapingba, Chongqing (Central University, Chongqing University, Sichuan Normal University, and Nankai Middle School); (4) Zunyi and Meitan in Guizhou (Zhejiang University); (5) Liangfeng, Guangxi (Guangxi University); (6) Pingshi, Guangdong (Sun Yat-sen University); (7) Guizhou area (Guangdong Provincial Arts and Sciences College); (8) Shapingba in Chengdu (West China University, Jinling University, Qilu University, and Jinling Women‚Äôs College); (9) Majiabao in Hanzhong (Northwest Medical University); (10) San Tai, Sichuan (Northeast University); (11) Kunming, Yunnan (Southwest United University and Yunnan University); (12) Gulu Ba, Shaanxi (Northwest Institute of Technology).</p>
<p>The student service centers (or communities) primarily provided spaces for collective activities, allowing students to sing, play games, study, discuss various life issues, and even receive vocational training. Given the limitations imposed by the wartime university environment, these centers became crucial for student leisure and activities. Each service center or community had student officers responsible for managing its initiatives, enabling students to take charge and foster a spirit of service.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, as many universities returned to their original locations, the student communities continued to support students across various campuses. The National Committee for Religious Work among Government University Students was restructured and renamed the National Committee for Religious Work among University Students.</p>
<p>By 1949, there were still eight student communities active nationwide, located at Tsinghua University in Beiping, Northeast University in Shenyang, Jinling Women‚Äôs University in Nanjing, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the Student Community at Lake Luojia in Wuchang, the Student Community in Chongqing, and the Student Community in Chengdu.</p>
<p>From the War of Resistance to the post-war period, these student communities became focal points for infiltration by underground Communist Party elements. A notable example is the underground pastor Li Chuwen, who played a significant role in leading student service activities during the war in Kunming.</p>

<p>The Five-Year Evangelistic Movement was a plan established in May 1929 at the seventh annual meeting of the National Christian Council of China in Hangzhou, aiming to fulfill the mission of Christ in a short time, develop a Christ-like life among believers, and meet the urgent spiritual needs of the masses. The assembly suggested that various churches and Christian organizations pool their resources to launch this planned evangelism, sparking a concerted effort starting January 1 of the following year.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of the movement included cultivating a deeper understanding of Christ among believers and intensifying fellowship, ultimately integrating Christ into every aspect of life.

<p>The movement‚Äôs focus was implemented across seven key areas: (1) evangelism, (2) religious education, (3) Christian family life, (4) literacy initiatives and rural reconstruction, (5) outreach to marginalized communities, (6) youth programs, and (7) establishing Christian economic relationships.</p>

<li>The Nanjing Safety Zone International Committee, 1937</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1937, following the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, fierce battles erupted, leading to Japanese forces bombing Nanjing. By mid-November, Japanese troops began their assault on the city, prompting the National Government to relocate to Chongqing. During this chaotic period, many foreign nationals evacuated Nanjing, although some remained and decided to establish a refugee safety zone, forming the International Committee with members including Miner S. Bates (from Jinling University‚Äôs History Department), George A. Fitch (general secretary of the YMCA in Nanjing), Minnie Vautrin (from Jinling Women‚Äôs University), and others. The committee was chaired by John Rabe, a German businessman.</p>
<p>The safety zone established by the committee was centered around various church institutions, including the American embassy, Jinling University, Jinling Women‚Äôs University, and Jinling Theological Seminary, covering an area of approximately 3.86 square kilometers, which included schools, churches, and hospitals. The committee declared the safety zone a non-combat area and requested the Japanese military to refrain from entering or attacking it. The Japanese authorities, however, refused to recognize the safety zone but indicated that as long as there were no Chinese military forces stationed there, they would not attack.</p>
<p>Despite the committee‚Äôs efforts unable to completely halt the violent acts of the Japanese military, it managed to save many lives during the Nanjing Massacre and condemned the aggressions on moral grounds. More importantly, the documentation by committee members became crucial evidence in revealing the horrors of the Nanjing Massacre in the future and provided firsthand accounts for the international community to comprehend this part of history.The discussions around the relationship between Christianity and modernism led to the emergence of different positions within the Chinese Christian community. In a 1931 editorial in the <em>Chinese Recorder</em>, it was noted that attention should be paid to communism as a primary adversary of Christianity. E.E. Barnett from the YMCA highlighted that modernists presented a well-organized and militant opponent to Christianity. George S. Eddy pointed out that Christianity and communism shared commonalities, particularly in their pursuit of a new social order, acknowledging themselves as the only saviors. His viewpoints were later translated into Chinese by Zhang Shizhang and published in the 1931 edition of <em>Yesheng</em>.</p>
<p>In the Chinese church circles, Cheng Jingyi expressed in the preface of the Chinese translation that the opinions and assertions in the report ‚Äúmay not be entirely satisfactory, but are certainly a necessary remedy.‚Äù He stated, ‚ÄúIt cannot be said that everything is correct and irrefutable, but its sincere desire to seek improvements for the church is indeed commendable.‚Äù However, Zhao Zichan, the dean of Yenching University‚Äôs Divinity School, published <em>A Critique of the First Four Chapters of the Report on Missionary Work</em> in 1934, providing severe criticisms of the first four chapters of the report. He particularly took issue with the section discussing Christianity‚Äôs uniqueness, expressing dissatisfaction that the report completely omitted the concept of the ‚ÄúIncarnation‚Äù and failed to explain Jesus as the Son of God. He argued that without recognizing such aspects, ‚Äúthe uniqueness of Christianity may very well be called into question.‚Äù He further noted that the greatness and necessity of Christianity in China did not lie in its introduction of science or humanism, nor in providing a paradigm of the character of Jesus, but rather in the essence of Jesus himself.</p>
<p>In addition to being seen as a critique against modernism, the term ‚Äúspiritual movement‚Äù emerged among believers, indicating a collective identity against liberal approaches without labeling themselves strictly as ‚Äúfundamentalist.‚Äù The term ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù was not widely used in early 20th-century Chinese churches. Rather than identifying as ‚Äúfundamentalists,‚Äù many Chinese Christian leaders preferred to describe themselves as ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù or ‚Äúconservative.‚Äù For various reasons, such as differences in theological understanding and social contexts, Chinese church leaders did not possess the same strong self-identification with ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù as seen in American counterparts.</p>
<p>Notably, while Chinese Christians opposed modernism, they did so more from a sense of spiritual identity rather than solely as defenders of doctrinal purity. Figures like Wu Yaozong actively reflected on and explored the relationship between Christianity and communism. In his 1934 book <em>The Social Gospel</em>, Wu authored several articles discussing the topic, such as ‚ÄúPacifism and Social Reconstruction,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Significance of the Social Gospel,‚Äù ‚ÄúSocial Gospel and Personal Gospel,‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristianity and Communism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Wu compared the similarities and differences between Christianity and communism, aiming to help believers shed unnecessary fears and preconceptions about communism while also establishing the unique contributions of Christianity to social reconstruction. He noted that Christianity could learn from communism in two key areas: social passion and social realism. He believed, ‚ÄúChristianity historically has had the zeal for social transformation, though it may not be evident now.‚Äù In his view, the actions of communist practitioners could reignite the ardor for social transformation within Christianity. Wu believed that this was not a significant issue; rather, the main challenge lay in communism‚Äôs ‚Äúrealistic social view.‚Äù He positioned Christianity as ‚Äúidealistic,‚Äù recognizing that the greatest challenge for the church lay in how to implement its ideals. He suggested that if ‚Äúthe prophetic mission‚Äù involves denouncing the old world and aspiring to a new era, then communism, in this regard, seemed to outperform Christianity.</p>
<p>In 1939, when writing the preface for Miner S. Bates‚Äô book <em>Christianity and Communism</em>, Wu reaffirmed Christianity‚Äôs unique contribution to social issues, but he expressed great concern about the inability to realize this advocacy. He pointed out that if Christianity itself could not escape the dilemmas of idealism, then what basis did it have to criticize communism? He further stated that if ‚Äúthe prophetic mission‚Äù denotes a denunciation of the old world and the hope for a new era, then communism has evidently demonstrated superiority in this regard. He argued that while Christians lament their failure to manifest Christianity‚Äôs social significance, they should also recognize how God‚Äôs word is proclaimed in movements striving for social change‚Äîeven in those that are non-Christian or even antagonistic to Christianity‚Äîand acknowledge their contributions to social causes. Christians should seek cooperation as long as it does not contravene Christian principles.(7) Lifting of the Ancestor Worship Ban by the Vatican, 1939</p>
<p>On October 20, 1939, Pope Pius XII ascended to the papacy and issued the encyclical <em>Summi Pontificatus</em>, stating that not all customs in global civilization are necessarily related to religious nature, and thus should be examined with goodwill and, where possible, protected and encouraged. He also affirmed the participation in social rites arising out of patriotism.</p>
<p>On December 4, 1939, the Vatican‚Äôs Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith held a general assembly, and on December 8, it issued a directive lifting the ban on ancestor worship activities in China, asserting that the significance of honoring ancestors lies in filial respect. Therefore, it encouraged bowing before the deceased, their images, or memorial plaques bearing their names, or to express respect in other cultural, non-religious ways. The directive clarified that honoring Confucius was not a religious act but rather an expression of respect for a great individual. Believers could pay their respects to Confucius in front of images, memorial plaques, Confucian temples, or schools (including church schools). This order also abolished the prohibition against ancestor worship from the encyclical <em>Ex Quo Singulari</em>, issued on July 11, 1742, which had instructed priests to refuse to engage in these activities.</p>
<p>The long-standing ‚ÄúRitual Controversy‚Äù within Catholicism, which dates back to the 17th century, found resolution with the 1939 directive. In contrast, within Protestant Christianity, discussions had been held in the 1930s regarding a ‚ÄúRespecting Ancestors‚Äù initiative, which was discussed during the eighth annual meeting of the National Christian Council of China in 1931. This initiative included: (1) creating memorials for ancestors (memorial halls or monuments); (2) compiling family genealogies; (3) holding family remembrance gatherings; (4) organizing ancestor memorial meetings. The proposals for family remembrance gatherings suggested holding them around Easter, in homes, churches, or cemeteries, focusing on reflection, teachings, and silent prayers. As for bowing or honoring ancestors, members were encouraged to do so according to their own conscience. When a female believer married into a non-believing family, it was suggested that she first promote the renunciation of superstitions and seek to reconcile her family‚Äôs sentiments. In cases where male believers lost inheritance rights due to not honoring ancestors, it was advised to ‚Äúsacrifice rights to preserve faith.‚Äù It is evident that the proposals still operated under the premise of opposing traditional ancestor worship, advocating for a Christianized form of honoring ancestors instead. However, the annual meeting ultimately did not conclude with any discussions or decisions, merely encouraging the diligent practice of family worship.</p>

<li>The National Christian YMCA‚Äôs Efforts to Remove the Christian Youth Association, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1930, the National Tsinghua University established the ‚ÄúMovement to Remove the Christian Youth Association,‚Äù which directly attacked Christianity, labeling it as ‚Äúa force that numbs the populace, cultivates submissiveness, and adeptly caters to its environment.‚Äù The movement argued that Christianity was used by the ruling class to ‚Äúsoftly suppress resistance‚Äù among the masses and described it as ‚Äúan anti-scientific faith, an obstacle to human civilization and evolution.‚Äù Tsinghua University, as a place for ‚Äúpursuing academic inquiry and truth,‚Äù found Christianity to be ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù with its mission. The declaration also referred back to the opposition against the World Student Christian Federation meeting held at Tsinghua University in 1922, stating that their tolerance had been exhausted: ‚ÄúWe cannot sit idly by as our conscience and reason compel us to raise our voices against, no, we must eliminate the banner of Christianity, ensuring the Youth Association never reappears in our revered Tsinghua University.‚Äù</p>
<p>The movement produced a special issue of <em>Tsinghua Weekly</em>, specifically focused on the removal of Christianity, which included 20 articles. The editorial introduction explicitly stated that they intended to analyze religion‚Äôs consciousness using ‚Äúmaterialistic dialectics‚Äù and pointed out that ‚Äúthe success of removing Christianity relies more on actual political struggles than mere promotional efforts.‚Äù</p>
<p>During the Christmas season of 1930, the movement escalated by posting anti-Christian slogans across campus, asserting intentions to use force to reclaim the Youth Association‚Äôs presence at the school.</p>

<li>The Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs Student Movement in Christian Schools, 1937</li>
</ol>
<p>In October 1937, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved the establishment of a committee in Shanghai under the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, with Liu Xiao as the provincial secretary responsible for rebuilding the underground party in Shanghai. At this time, due to the mobilization of numerous party members to rear and base areas, the number of underground members in Shanghai dwindled to around 100. In March 1938, the Central Committee issued a decision on the mass development of party members, emphasizing a ‚Äúpressing and serious task‚Äù to ‚Äúrapidly scale up membership by tenfold.‚Äù Liu Xiao was instructed to create a ‚Äúlean, extremely secretive party organization‚Äù in ‚Äúenemy-occupied central cities.‚Äù</p>
<p>By the end of 1938, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee decided to enhance their work in Christian schools and organizations due to the considerable presence of YMCA groups and church schools in the Shanghai International Settlement, leading to the establishment of the ‚ÄúStudent Movement Committee of Christian Schools‚Äù (referred to as ‚ÄúChristian School Committee‚Äù), which was organizationally separate from the Student Movement Committee.</p>
<p>The Christian School Committee directly led party branches in various church universities, including Hujiang, St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs, Zhiqiang, Dongwu, and Aurora. This was part of a larger initiative to strengthen ties with churches while establishing a foothold in educational institutions. By October 1939, the system of the Christian School Committee had developed 54 party members.</p>
<p>In September 1942, the Christian School Committee was merged into a unified leadership under the Student Movement Committee, and the district committees of church secondary schools were restructured under the Middle School Working Committee. By October 1944, the middle school working committee was dissolved, and district committee work was transferred directly to the student committee. During the war, the CCP established party organizations in 68 ordinary secondary schools in Shanghai, including church schools, with around 560 party members developed by 1945.</p>
<p>Overall, the early years leading up to the War of Resistance saw significant developments within the Chinese church and its engagement with broader political movements, particularly in navigating the complex intersections of faith and national identity.</p>
