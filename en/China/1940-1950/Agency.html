<li>Zhao Shiguang</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhao Shiguang (Timothy Dzao, 1908-1973), originally named Zhao Yuanchang, was born in Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, but grew up in a non-Christian family in Shanghai. He received his education at church schools and joined Sunday School in 1921 under the guidance of his cousin. In December 1924, Zhao was baptized at the Methodist Church‚Äôs Moulton Chapel in Shanghai, adopting the name Shiguang. In 1925, he participated in a spiritual retreat led by Yu Cidu in Shanghai and later attended a revival meeting conducted by the British pastor Wilkes Paget, where he resolved to dedicate himself to preaching. After graduating from high school in 1926, he continued his studies at the Shanghai Evangelical Church‚Äôs Shoucheng Theological School while also teaching at a nearby elementary school. He began working at Shoucheng Church in July 1928.</p>
<p>From 1930 onwards, Zhang led revival meetings in Hangzhou, leading to spiritual awakenings. In 1932, he was ordained as a pastor by Baptist pastor Evans. In 1935 and 1939, he served as a speaker at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Spiritual Conferences, leading Bible studies and revival sermons.</p>
<p>Between 1936 and 1941, Zhao accepted an invitation from the China Inland Mission‚Äôs R. A. Jeffray to preach in the Nanyang islands (Philippines, Borneo, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.). After returning to Shanghai, he founded the Bread of Life Church in January 1942, initially operating in the auditorium of Shanghai Joint Education School, and later establishing branches in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other locations. He also launched the magazine ‚ÄúSpirit Food,‚Äù which included the publication of hymns. In 1945, he established the ‚ÄúBread of Life World Mission,‚Äù followed by the establishment of the Bread of Life Theological Institute and East China Theological College in Suzhou. The seminary advocated for a life of faith, rejecting fundraising and only accepting voluntary donations from believers. At the time, he observed approximately 20,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai and sent staff to lead Bible studies in English for the Jewish community.</p>
<p>In March 1949, Zhao traveled to the U.S. to lead meetings and shared the needs of the Chinese church at a missionary convention. Returning through Hong Kong, he preached at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Spiritual Meetings. After leaving Hong Kong, he spent over a month in Taipei before returning to Shanghai. During his stay in Taipei, he decided to bring his family back to leave China. On October 1, they departed Shanghai, traveling first by sea to Taipei and then transferring to Hong Kong. In November, he hosted the first worship service of the Bread of Life Church in Hong Kong at the Kowloon Baptist Church. Starting January 1, 1950, he rented a theater to hold Sunday revival evangelistic meetings, with advertisements placed on the front pages of the <em>China Daily</em>, <em>Sing Tao Daily</em>, and <em>Hong Kong Commercial Daily</em>, promoting it with the theme ‚ÄúThe Great Event of 1950.‚Äù Attendance reached 1,200 that day. Subsequently, he utilized the Salvation Army and other churches to conduct a 30-day evangelistic series and held another 40-day series at Xun Guang School. In September 1951, after the completion of the new church building at 22 Gai Lin Road in Kowloon, they celebrated with another 100 days of evangelism. In 1958, he was consecrated as a bishop in the Bread of Life Church.</p>
<p>Starting in the second half of 1951, the Chinese church underwent an intensive movement of denunciation. During the denunciation conferences held at the Shanghai Bread of Life Church, Zhao Shiguang became a target of internal criticism, being labeled a tool of American imperialism and an enemy of the Chinese people. In July 1952, Zhao moved his family to Indonesia, while still serving as the president of the ‚ÄúBread of Life World Mission,‚Äù with the headquarters remaining in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>After leaving Hong Kong, he traveled to various places, including Java, Borneo, Bangka, Sumatra, Indonesia, Thailand, and Japan, leading evangelistic meetings and establishing branches of the Bread of Life Church. From February to May 1955, Zhao traveled to Europe and the United States, stopping in places like America, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Athens. From October to November, he also visited London, Germany, and Yugoslavia. By 1967, his evangelistic efforts had spread to Vietnam, the United States (Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco), France, India, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Africa, the Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>In 1955, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Taylor University in the United States. In 1965, he was elected president of the Fellowship of Asian Evangelicals.</p>
<p>Zhao Shiguang‚Äôs health began to decline in 1972, and he passed away on September 13, 1973, at the age of 65.</p>

<li>The Amethyst, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>In January 1930, <em>The Amethyst: A Journal of Christian Fellowship, Worship and Devotion</em>, edited by Liu Tingfang, was first published. Its content primarily focused on spirituality, worship, and fellowship. Unlike many debate-oriented publications of the Republic era, <em>The Amethyst</em> emphasized the creation of prayers, hymns, and liturgies, representing a new approach to constructing an indigenous Chinese church.</p>
<p>In the editorial titled ‚ÄúA Conversation with Friends Meeting <em>The Amethyst</em> for the First Time,‚Äù the importance of ‚Äúpersonal devotion,‚Äù ‚Äúprivate spirituality,‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic worship‚Äù in Christian life was emphasized. It outlined three essential elements: ‚Äúreverence, sincerity, and beauty.‚Äù The text articulated that ‚Äúto pursue beauty without sincerity is merely superficial, while sincerity without beauty can lead to neglect.‚Äù Therefore, believers ‚Äúshould not only seek moral guidance from collective worship but must also attain a sense of spiritual beauty and joy.‚Äù Worshiping God involves engaging heartily and sincerely‚Äî‚Äúthe beautiful music, hymns, literature, and architecture are all the crystallization of human effort, and when offering them up to God, they should be presented with their inherent beauty.‚Äù In light of the chaotic and tumultuous external influences on the church and the arduous internal circumstances faced by believers, <em>The Amethyst</em> was envisioned to promote ‚Äúmore solemn worship, deeper spirituality, and closer fellowship,‚Äù which it identified as an urgent need.</p>
<p>The mission of <em>The Amethyst</em> was established as follows: (1) ‚Äúto center on spirituality, worship, and fellowship‚Äù; (2) ‚Äúto employ experimentation, discussion, and exchange as methods‚Äù; (3) the content was to include discussions on fellowship, preaching, reflections on spirituality, hymns, prayers (both personal and communal), liturgical practices, notes, book reviews, and miscellaneous writings. The publication was not affiliated with any specific organization but was the collaborative effort of Liu Tingfang, Yang Yinliu, Xie Jingsheng, Xu Dishan, and others dedicated to experimenting with spirituality, worship, and fellowship.</p>
<p>For instance, the January 1932 issue of <em>The Amethyst</em> focused on the theme of ‚ÄúNational Crisis,‚Äù featuring an article titled ‚ÄúAn Appeal in Light of National Hardship‚Äù by Liu Tingfang, which called for repentance for the nation‚Äôs hardships, pleading for God‚Äôs mercy and forgiveness for the sins of the Chinese people. Additionally, an article titled ‚ÄúThe National Crisis Confession‚Äù also by Liu emphasized the biblical basis for a collective declaration of faith before God amidst national turmoil. Several petitions for prayer related to the crisis were included, reflecting the urgent need for spiritual engagement during a turbulent time.</p>
<p>The publication of <em>The Amethyst</em> garnered significant interest among its readership, accumulating 8,000 subscribers by its one-year anniversary and distributing copies across the country. By the pre-war period, the circulation had risen to 50,000, and in March 1941, it maintained 15,000 copies in circulation, which further increased to 35,000 by 1942, showcasing its influence and reach within the Chinese Christian community.(2) Zhao Junying</p>
<p>Zhao Junying (Calvin Chao, 1906-1996) was born in Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, and raised in a non-Christian family in Nanjing. He began attending Sunday School at the age of six and was baptized at eleven. From ages eight to eighteen, he received his primary and secondary education in church schools. In 1922, James Graham III, a missionary from the Southern Presbyterian Church who was then the principal of Huai Mei High School in Yancheng, taught Zhao. The Anti-Christian Movement that erupted in 1924 impacted Zhao‚Äôs faith, and influenced by anti-imperialist sentiment, he became involved in student movements. After graduating from high school in 1925, he enrolled at Zhijiang University in Hangzhou and then transferred to Jinling University in 1928. However, he had to drop out due to a lung illness during his senior year, leading to treatment at the Love and Mercy Hospital of the Southern Presbyterian Church from 1928 to 1931. During his illness, he read works by Tolstoy and spiritual literature, which solidified his faith. He later lived in the home of James R. Graham II, James Graham III‚Äôs father, where he received care from Mrs.&nbsp;Graham.</p>
<p>In 1931, he worked as an English teacher at a church school in Jiangyin, where he was deeply inspired by meetings led by Ji Zhiwen and Song Shangjie. Following this, he attended a meeting led by Wang Mingdao in Lushan, where he gained greater assurance of his salvation. In 1935, he resolved to dedicate himself to ministry and served in the Jiangsu Inland Mission while also speaking at various revival meetings. After the War of Resistance, Zhao noted that many university students and intellectuals had fled to the southwest, prompting him to commit to student evangelism.</p>
<p>In 1943, Zhao served as the supervisor of the China Native Evangelistic Crusade (CNEC), initiated by Duncan McRoberts and supported by a group of Christian businessmen from Seattle. This movement aimed to fund Chinese missionaries to evangelize their compatriots. In 1944, Zhao worked alongside the China Inland Mission and David Adeney to conduct evangelism on university campuses in Chongqing.</p>
<p>In July 1945, Zhao organized the first National Christian Student Summer Conference at the Bread of Life Institute on Nanshan in Chongqing. There were 153 representatives from 41 university Christian fellowships attending, and Zhao delivered the opening sermon while explaining the conference‚Äôs significance. The opening night saw around 600 participants filling the auditorium. Afterward, he collaborated with Jia Yuming on Bible study sessions and with M.A.&nbsp;Hopkins on special sessions. During the conference, the ‚ÄúChinese Inter-varsity Christian Fellowship‚Äù (CIVCF) was established, with Zhao as the executive secretary.</p>
<p>After the victory in the War of Resistance, the CNEC had a total of 38 evangelists working in five provinces: Guizhou, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Gansu. To expand the evangelistic work eastward, the CNEC‚Äôs office moved from Chongqing to Nanjing and then to Shanghai. In 1947, Zhao resigned from his position as the supervisor of the China Native Evangelistic Crusade to serve full-time as the general secretary of the ‚ÄúChinese Federation of Christian Students.‚Äù</p>
<p>In November 1948, Zhao and his family arrived in Hong Kong, where he founded a short-term missionary and spiritual training institute. In 1949, he served as a speaker at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Spiritual Conferences. In December 1950, he returned to the Chinese Native Evangelism Commission as a supervisor (formerly known as the China Native Evangelistic Crusade). During his time in Hong Kong, he organized evangelistic teams to preach in refugee areas, later naming the organization ‚ÄúThe Chinese Overseas Gospel Mission.‚Äù In 1951, Zhao traveled to Southeast Asia for evangelism. In 1956, he resigned as supervisor of the Chinese Native Evangelism Commission and moved to the United States with his family. By 1959, he established the ‚ÄúChinese For Christ, Inc.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 1985, Zhao founded the ‚ÄúChinese For Christ Theological Seminary‚Äù in Los Angeles.(1) Zhao Shiguang</p>
<p>Zhao Shiguang (Timothy Dzao, 1908-1973), originally named Zhao Yuanchang, was born in Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, but grew up in a non-Christian family in Shanghai. He was educated in church schools and joined Sunday School at the age of six, being baptized at eleven. From ages eight to eighteen, he received his education at various church schools. In 1922, under the teachings of James Graham III, the principal of Huai Mei High School, Zhao was influenced in his faith. The Anti-Christian Movement that erupted in 1924 impacted Zhao, prompting him to engage in student activism against imperialism. After graduating from high school in 1925, Zhao attended Zhijiang University in Hangzhou and later transferred to Jinling University in 1928. Due to a lung illness during his senior year, he had to drop out and received medical treatment at the Love and Mercy Hospital from 1928 to 1931. During his recovery, he read Tolstoy‚Äôs works and various spiritual literature, which solidified his faith. He found care in the home of James R. Graham II, the father of his former principal.</p>
<p>In 1931, Zhao began teaching English at a church school in Jiangyin, where he was deeply moved by gatherings led by Ji Zhiwen and Song Shangjie. Subsequently, he attended meetings led by Wang Mingdao in Lushan, which greatly reassured him of his salvation. In 1935, he dedicated himself to ministry and served with the Jiangsu Inland Mission, while also leading revival meetings.</p>
<p>By 1936, Zhao had established the Bread of Life Church in Shanghai, seeking to provide spiritual guidance in areas affected by war. He became increasingly aware of the plight of students and intellectuals who had fled to the southwest due to the conflict. In 1943, he became the supervisor of the China Native Evangelistic Crusade (CNEC), which aimed to provide resources for evangelism among the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Zhao led various outreach activities, and in July 1945, he organized the first National Christian Student Summer Conference at the Bread of Life Institute in Chongqing, attended by representatives from 41 university Christian fellowships. By the end of the conference, the Chinese Inter-varsity Christian Fellowship (CIVCF) was formed with Zhao as the general secretary. After the war, Zhao continued to lead initiatives to support Christian work across China.</p>
<p>In 1949, he was invited to the United States to speak on the needs of the Chinese church and later returned to Hong Kong, where he continued his work in evangelism. Notably, during political upheaval and pressures against religious groups, Zhao remained committed to his mission work, even amidst accusations of being influenced by foreign powers.</p>
<p>In 1951, he moved to Indonesia briefly before returning to the United States, where he pursued further ministry opportunities. His dedication to church growth and community service continued until his passing on September 13, 1973.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Jiang Changchuan</li>
</ol>
<p>Jiang Changchuan (Z. T. Kaung, 1884-1958) was elected as the first Chinese bishop of the Methodist Church in China in 1941. Born in Shanghai, he attended a Methodist school at the age of 14 and was instructed by a female missionary, Clara E. Steger, being baptized at 19. He became the first Christian in his family. After graduating from the Anglo-Chinese College in 1909, Jiang aspired to serve the church and studied theology at Soochow University, graduating in 1912 as its sole theology graduate.</p>
<p>Jiang was later appointed as an assistant pastor at Moulton Chapel in Shanghai and became a full pastor the following year. He served for three years at Haidao Church in Huzhou, Zhejiang, before moving to Suzhou and becoming district superintendent, and then moving to Shanghai‚Äôs Jinglin Church.</p>
<p>In December 1927, Soong Mei-ling married Chiang Kai-shek. Since Chiang was not yet a Christian, Jiang did not officiate their wedding. On October 23, 1930, Chiang Kai-shek was baptized by Jiang at his home, becoming a member of the Methodist Church.</p>
<p>Outside of his pastoral duties, Jiang was appointed to the board of his alma mater, Soochow University, in 1924, becoming one of the first Chinese board members. He served as chair of the board from 1928 to 1940 and again from 1945 to 1947.</p>
<p>Jiang attended the American Methodist Church conferences in the U.S. five times between 1919 and 1940. In 1926, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Theology from Asbury University. He served as president of the Chinese Student Missionary Society from 1920 to 1930 and was the chair of the Suzhou and Zhejiang Annual Conference from 1934 to 1941, also holding roles such as president of the National Sunday School Association in 1937.</p>
<p>In 1939, the American Methodist Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Methodist Protestant Church united to form the Methodist Church (USA). In 1941, these three organizations convened an unification conference to establish the Methodist Church of China, and Jiang was elected as its first Chinese bishop, serving in Beiping to oversee church affairs in northern China.</p>
<p>After Beiping was occupied by the Japanese military, Jiang was appointed to lead the organization under the influence of Japanese authorities in October 1942. Despite internal pressure and being designated ‚Äúuncooperative‚Äù by the Japanese military, he maintained his duties while trying to keep a distance from the Japanese church authorities.</p>
<p>In early 1950, Jiang became the deputy leader of the national conference‚Äôs reform plans. He remained active in church leadership until his passing in 1958.(1) The Five Year Evangelistic Movement</p>
<p>In May 1929, the National Christian Council of China convened its seventh annual meeting in Hangzhou, where they decided to establish the ‚ÄúFive Year Evangelistic Movement Committee‚Äù to implement a five-year evangelistic plan. The purpose was to ‚Äúexpeditiously fulfill the mission of Christ, develop a Christian lifestyle among believers, and meet the urgent religious needs of the people.‚Äù The assembly proposed that the council unite various churches and Christian organizations, pooling their resources to launch the Five Year Evangelistic Movement starting on January 1 of the following year. The goals included: (1) deepening believers‚Äô knowledge of Christ and intensifying fellowship with a courageous spirit; (2) expanding evangelistic efforts with the aim of significantly increasing the number of believers over the five-year period.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúFive Year Movement‚Äù became the focal point of the council‚Äôs work, implemented through seven key areas of activity: (1) evangelism; (2) religious education; (3) Christian family life; (4) literacy initiatives and rural reconstruction; (5) outreach to the marginalized; (6) youth programs; (7) establishing Christian economic relationships.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs Baptism, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>On December 1, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek married Soong Mei-ling, who came from a Christian family. Due to this background, Soong Guizhen insisted that any suitor for her daughter must be a Christian. Chiang assured Soong Guizhen that he would genuinely read the Bible if he were to become a Christian, which led to her consent for their marriage. However, since Chiang had not yet been baptized, they could not hold a Christian wedding.</p>
<p>On October 23, 1930, Chiang was baptized at the home of the Soong family in Shanghai, officiated by Pastor Jiang Changchuan of the Methodist Church. The only witnesses present were Soong Mei-ling, Soong Ziwen, and a few close friends. Following this event, the media reported on Chiang‚Äôs conversion, which garnered considerable attention.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>National Christian Literacy Movement Seminar, 1930</li>
</ol>
<p>From April 24 to May 10, 1930, the National Christian Council of China held a seminar on the National Christian Literacy Movement in Ding County, Hebei Province, attended by over 90 representatives from 11 provinces and nine denominations. The seminar was held in Ding County due to the successful efforts of the Popular Education Promotion Association in the area. Representatives examined various educational projects implemented by churches, focusing on how to enhance community literacy and help foster a culture of learning within the church.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Lichuan Experiment Project, 1934</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of the 1920s, rural reconstruction movements gained traction across China. By 1934, there were 691 organizations involved in these efforts. In response to the Communist land reform agenda, the National Government also initiated its own rural service initiatives in Jiangxi. The Lichuan Experiment, however, was spearheaded by the church and operated independently of the government‚Äôs established programs.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The Christian Farmer, 1934</li>
</ol>
<p>In August 1934, <em>The Christian Farmer</em> was launched by the North China Christian Agricultural Development Association, edited by Liu Tingfang.

<p>In May 1929, the National Christian Council of China convened its seventh annual meeting in Hangzhou, where it decided to establish the ‚ÄúFive Year Evangelistic Movement Committee‚Äù to implement a five-year evangelistic plan. The aim was to ‚Äúexpeditiously fulfill the mission of Christ, develop a Christ-like life among believers, and meet the urgent spiritual needs of the people.‚Äù The assembly proposed that the council unite various churches and Christian organizations to pool their resources for this movement, starting on January 1 of the following year. Goals included: (1) deepening believers‚Äô understanding of Christ and intensifying fellowship, ultimately integrating Christ into all aspects of life; (2) expanding evangelism with the aim of significantly increasing the number of believers within five years.</p>
<p>The movement became the focal point of the council‚Äôs work and was implemented across seven key areas: (1) evangelism; (2) religious education; (3) Christian family life; (4) literacy initiatives and rural reconstruction; (5) outreach to marginalized communities; (6) youth programs; (7) fostering Christian economic relationships.</p>

<li>Overview of Church Movements in China</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout the decades, various church movements and responses emerged among Chinese Christians, particularly in light of the social and political upheavals they faced. These responses not only addressed spiritual needs but also sought to engage with national challenges, highlighting the role of Christianity in the reconstruction of Chinese society.</p>
<p>During the mentioned decades, the themes of missionary work, the challenges posed by modernism, and efforts to unify Christian practices amid socio-political changes shaped the landscape of the Chinese Christian community, reflecting ongoing tensions and negotiations between faith and contemporary societal issues.(1) Zhao Shiguang</p>
<p>Zhao Shiguang (Calvin Chao, 1906-1996) was born in Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, and raised in a non-Christian family in Nanjing. He began attending Sunday School at the age of six and was baptized at eleven. From ages eight to eighteen, he received his education at various church schools. In 1922, under the influence of James Graham III, the principal of Huai Mei High School in Yancheng, Zhao‚Äôs faith was further developed. The Anti-Christian Movement that erupted in 1924 left an impact on Zhao, prompting him to engage in activism against imperialist oppression.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school in 1925, he enrolled at Zhijiang University in Hangzhou and then transferred to Jinling University in 1928. Due to a lung illness during his senior year, he had to drop out and spent several years receiving treatment at the Love and Mercy Hospital of the Southern Presbyterian Church, where he read works by Tolstoy and various spiritual literature that strengthened his faith. After recovering, he returned to church work and began preaching.</p>
<p>In 1931, Zhao became the general secretary of the National Christian Church in China and participated in various church events. By 1932, he had established the Bread of Life Church in Shanghai, focusing on spiritual guidance and community outreach.</p>

<p>This overview highlights key figures and movements within the Chinese Christian community, showcasing how they navigated challenges and sought to integrate their faith with social realities in a rapidly changing political landscape.(1) Zhao Shiguang</p>
<p>After being released from jail, Zhao Shiguang was taken in by Ling Xianyang, the president of the North China Anglican Church, and resided within the church‚Äôs premises in Beiping. During this time, he completed manuscripts for <em>The Christian Inquiry</em> and <em>The Life of St.&nbsp;Paul</em>. In the late 1940s, Zhao published works such as <em>The Nature and Necessity of the Church</em> (1946) and <em>The Meaning of the Christian Church</em> (1948), where he elaborated on his ecclesiology.</p>
<p>In 1947, he received an honorary doctorate from Princeton University in the United States. In 1948, he was elected as one of the six presidents of the World Council of Churches.</p>
<p>Following the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of Beiping in 1949, Zhao maintained an optimistic outlook toward the new order under Communist governance. In September 1949, he represented the religious community at the new Political Consultative Conference, and in May 1950, he participated in the North China Christian Delegation, meeting with Zhou Enlai alongside other Christian leaders. Zhao‚Äôs primary focus in the years before and after the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China was exploring how Christianity could reform itself in response to the profound political and social transformations occurring. In 1950, he published <em>Paths to Reform in the Chinese Christian Church</em>, <em>Reform of the Church Under Trial</em>, and <em>Building Fellowship in Love</em>, expressing his main arguments for reforming the Chinese church.</p>
<p>However, in July 1950, Zhao agreed to serve as a proponent of the Three-Self Reform Declaration initiated by Wu Yaozong. After the CCP intervened in the Korean War, there was a surge of anti-American sentiment within church universities, and Zhao began to voice support for Chinese involvement in the war. By February 1951, Yenching University was officially taken over by the Ministry of Education. Zhao proposed renaming the seminary to Yenching Theological Institute and registered it with the Beijing Municipal Government, seeking official approval to establish it as a private religious institution. In April, when the campaign against ‚Äúcounter-revolutionaries‚Äù began, he protested to the World Council of Churches and submitted his resignation, denouncing both Reinhold Niebuhr and the World Council. In July, the denunciation campaign targeted Yenching Theological Institute, culminating in a struggle session in November where Zhao faced severe criticism. In December, the Beijing Municipal Committee dispatched a ‚Äúwork team‚Äù to the campus to lead the campaign. Zhao, along with Zhang Dongxun from the Philosophy Department and Lu Zhiwei, the president, were heavily criticized. In March 1952, the bishop of the North China Anglican Church, Ling Xianyang, publicly announced the removal of Zhao from his position as president and all roles within the church. The role of seminary president was temporarily taken over by Jiang Yizhen. Besides Zhao, several students were labeled as a ‚Äúgroup of Zhao Zichan‚Äôs disciples.‚Äù This movement continued until May. After the campaign, Zhao Zichan‚Äôs influence within Yenching Theological Institute was thoroughly diminished.</p>
<p>However, in July 1954, Zhao Zichan was invited to the National Conference of Chinese Christianity as the president of the Chinese Anglican Church and was elected as one of the committee members. In April 1955, he was elected as a member of the People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. In 1956, when the National Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was established, he was elected as a member as a professor at Yenching Theological Institute, tasked to criticize American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. During the Cultural Revolution, Zhao also faced criticism.</p>
<p>On November 21, 1979, Zhao Zichan passed away in Beijing after suffering from illness, at the age of 91.</p>

<li>Chen Chonggui</li>
</ol>
<p>Chen Chonggui (Marcus Ch‚Äôeng, 1884-1964) became the president of Chongqing Theological Seminary in 1944. Originally from Anhui, he was born in Wuchang, Hubei, with the given name Chonggui. During his studies, he disliked the character ‚Äúgui,‚Äù so his teacher renamed him ‚ÄúChonggui.‚Äù His father, influenced by friends, was baptized and joined the American Episcopal Church. At six years old, Chen attended a charity school set up by the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden for impoverished children and was baptized into the church at 16.</p>
<p>In 1901, with support from the Mission Covenant Church, he attended Wesley College and hoped to be trained as a preacher. Subsequently, the church worried that he would not stay in ministry after graduation; thus, they directed him to a seminary run by the church. However, Chen requested to continue his studies at Wesley College and promised to work in the church in the future. When he graduated in 1904, Chen joined the Mission Covenant Church; however, due to inadequate salary for supporting his family, he resigned after less than a year and shifted to teaching English in public schools.</p>
<p>In 1910, he became an English teacher at a church school in Jiangyin, leading to more engagements with the church community. Chen‚Äôs preaching and work attracted the attention of church leaders, leading him to participate actively in evangelistic activities. After returning to China, he took on prominent roles in various church organizations.</p>
<p>In 1939, Chen became heavily involved in the National Christian Council‚Äôs initiatives, focusing on education and social reform efforts, contributing significantly to church life and its engagement with broader societal changes in China during the politically turbulent times. His work bridged the church community‚Äôs spiritual influences while also addressing the pressing social needs of the era. Chen‚Äôs legacy includes a notable commitment to education and social welfare, ultimately shaping the trajectory of Chinese Protestantism through his leadership and advocacy.(1) The Journey of Zhao Shiguang</p>

<p>The political climate heated up, especially after the CCP intervened in the Korean War, leading to a broad anti-American sentiment in church universities.

<p>In March 1952, the Anglican bishop for the North China Province publicly announced Zhao‚Äôs removal from his position as president and all roles within the church. The president of the seminary was temporarily replaced by Jiang Yizhen, and several students were labeled as ‚Äúdisciples of Zhao Zichan.‚Äù The entire campaign continued until May, resulting in a complete dismantling of Zhao Zichan‚Äôs influence within the seminary.</p>

<li>The Journey of Liu Tingfang</li>
</ol>
<p>Liu Tingfang (Timothy T. Lew, 1891-1947) was born in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, as a third-generation Christian. His grandmother was one of the first in the family to engage with the China Inland Mission, and his father studied medicine in Edinburgh. Liu attended various institutions, including the United Methodist Free Churches‚Äô Wenzhou College, but became dissatisfied due to the school‚Äôs stance on foreign occupation, leading him to transfer to Shanghai St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University for preparatory studies.</p>
<p>In 1911, Liu was recommended to study in the United States on a scholarship and later graduated with both bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees from Columbia University. He returned to China and began teaching at Soochow University, where he actively engaged in the Student Christian Federation and the broader social reform movements.</p>
<p>In 1934, Liu was instrumental in launching the ‚ÄúChristian Student Service Program‚Äù and served as the editor of <em>The Amethyst</em>. He contributed significantly to the translation and editing of hymns for the <em>Hymns of Universal Praise</em>, emphasizing the incorporation of local idioms and styles.</p>
<p>By the late 1930s, Liu took on various leadership roles within the church and participated in inter-denominational discussions aimed at promoting social welfare. However, the pressures of war and political turmoil, combined with accusations of collaboration with foreign powers, led to critical challenges for his work.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, he remained dedicated to his mission, but health issues arose shortly before his passing in 1947. Despite facing such difficulties, Liu‚Äôs contributions to Chinese Christianity and social reform remained influential throughout his life.</p>

<li>The Impact of Zhao Zichan</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhao Zichan (T. C. Chao, 1888-1979) played a vital role within the Chinese Christian community, demonstrating a commitment to reform in light of modern challenges. He was elected as a prominent representative at the World Council of Churches and actively engaged in theological discussions regarding the relationship between Christianity and contemporary societal issues, urging the church to adapt and respond to political changes.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The National Christian Council</li>
</ol>
<p>The establishment of the National Christian Council set the stage for various actions and discussions regarding the alignment of Christianity with national aspirations. Leaders like Wu Yaozong actively reflected on the church‚Äôs role in addressing social transformation amid political turbulence, conveying a strong stance on collective responsibility among believers.</p>
<p>These individuals and movements collectively illustrate the dynamic landscape of Chinese Christianity in the early to mid-20th century, reflecting their responses to both domestic and international challenges while addressing the spiritual, social, and political complexities of the time.(1) The Formation of the National Christian Evangelistic Movement</p>
<p>In October 1939, the National Christian Council met in Nanchang, where Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling were also in attendance. The conference decided to establish the ‚ÄúJiangxi Christian Rural Service Union,‚Äù with Soong Mei-ling willing to contribute half of the funding for a period of five years.</p>
<p>In September 1934, the Jiangxi Lichuan Experiment Project officially commenced. The Lichuan Experiment was a church-led initiative, separate from the ten rural service areas established by the government. The first general secretary was George Shepherd, a missionary from the American Congregational Church in Minbei. However, he was recalled to the U.S. at the end of 1934, during which time Eugene A. Turner from the YMCA and Pastor Hu Bende took turns acting as general secretaries. In August 1935, Xu Baoqian from Yenching University was appointed as the general secretary. While Xu was not an expert in rural reconstruction, he accepted the challenge, believing that since the government was willing to allow the church to participate, it should seize the opportunity to contribute to the social reconstruction of China. Xu, driven by a spiritual calling, left behind a comfortable life to serve in the impoverished area of Lichuan.</p>
<p>The experiment focused its activities in the fourth district of Lichuan, primarily engaging with nearby villages. Efforts were organized around several areas, including education, healthcare, religion, women‚Äôs issues, agriculture, and industrial development.</p>
<p>However, the actual difficulties far exceeded the ideals, and the Lichuan Experiment faced numerous challenges. Initially, Shepherd had recruited over ten young people from various countries to serve, but cooperation among them proved challenging. The underdeveloped environment and unsatisfactory salaries made it difficult to attract qualified professionals, particularly in medicine and agriculture. Those who arrived with high hopes quickly became disillusioned due to the harsh realities they encountered, resulting in a high turnover rate among staff members, which significantly affected progress.</p>
<p>Some members of the council began to question the initiative, especially criticizing it for lacking religious activities and devolving into a purely social welfare program. However, Xu insisted that the experiment was fundamentally a religious project, as religion encompasses all aspects of life. He believed the church should serve rural communities with a spirit of Christ and work towards building a Christianized rural society, contrasting with some church leaders who regarded the endeavor merely as an evangelistic tool.</p>
<p>In 1936, Xu strengthened collaboration with the government, leading to one of his colleagues being appointed district chief by the provincial government. The Lichuan Experiment area also joined the provincial government‚Äôs rural improvement initiatives. Nonetheless, the relationship with the government raised suspicions within church circles. In 1937, Xu resigned due to disagreements with the council. Following the conclusion of Soong Mei-ling‚Äôs financial support after the five-year period, the project came to an end.</p>

<p>In August 1934, <em>The Christian Farmer</em> („ÄäÁî∞ÂÆ∂ÂçäÊúàÂàä„Äã) was published by the North China Christian Agricultural Development Association, with Liu Tingfang serving as the chief editor. The publication sought to serve the rural community in China, aiming to raise farmers‚Äô awareness and literacy while promoting scientific knowledge in agriculture and other areas. Unlike many other debate-oriented publications of the Republican era, <em>The Christian Farmer</em> focused on spirituality, worship, and community engagement.</p>
<p>It included sections such as ‚ÄúOpinions,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommon Sense,‚Äù ‚ÄúLiterature,‚Äù ‚ÄúReligion,‚Äù ‚ÄúLivelihood Supplement,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealth Supplement.‚Äù Notably, it employed language from the ‚ÄúThousand-Character Course for Farmers‚Äù published by the China Popular Education Promotion Association, integrating helpful phonetic annotations for readers. Its publication was part of the broader movement for rural reconstruction within the church.</p>
<p>Throughout the wartime period, the editorial work of <em>The Christian Farmer</em> seamlessly transitioned with Qilu University as it relocated to the rear areas, with continued publication amid the pressures and challenges of conflict.

Their contributions not only shaped the trajectory of Chinese Christianity but also reflected broader movements within the tension between faith, identity, and national consciousness amid significant challenges.(1) The Work of the Student Relief Committee and the Context of Refugee Students</p>
<p>The Student Relief Committee‚Äôs initiatives largely focused on the first category of students, especially those fleeing from occupied areas due to the war. They raised funds both domestically and internationally to provide essential support for students in need. Their efforts included establishing work-study positions to help students afford their education, offering subsidies to assist refugee students in returning home or relocating for studies, organizing activities, and providing temporary jobs to displaced students. The funding for these initiatives mainly came from organizations like the International Student Service and the Far-East Student Emergency Fund.</p>
<p>The Student Relief Committee also set up ‚ÄúChristian Student Service Centers‚Äù at national universities in remote areas to assist students and aid local church colleges, effectively expanding their outreach. By 1943, they had established 12 service centers in various provinces, providing vital support and fostering community engagement.</p>

<p>In late August 1950, after leaving China for England, Zhao Shiguang returned to the United States to serve as a missionary officer, focusing on the needs of Chinese and overseas students. In 1956, he was appointed as the Deputy General Secretary for the Asia region of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES), with the office located in Hong Kong. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he played a crucial role in establishing the Student Evangelical Fellowship, which resulted in the formation of various organizations such as the Inter-School Christian Fellowship, Graduate Christian Fellowship, Evangelical Reading Room, and Teacher Christian Fellowship. Notably, the Hong Kong Fellowship of Evangelical Students (FES), founded in 1961, contributed significantly to the development of the Christian student movement in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Zhao was active as a speaker for the Hong Kong and Kowloon Spiritual Retreat and Bible Study Meetings in 1957 and 1966. In 1968, the Overseas Missionary Fellowship (OMF) decided to establish a Discipleship Training Centre (DTC) in Singapore, which Zhao led. After leaving Hong Kong, he advanced student work across various regions including Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>In late 1976, Zhao retired and moved to Berkeley, California, but remained committed to supporting China and initiated the ‚ÄúWatchman for China‚Äù prayer movement. After Mao Zedong‚Äôs death in 1976, he believed that China was on the cusp of significant change. Following the arrest of the Gang of Four, he became increasingly convinced that a new era was approaching, urging Western Christians to prepare for the changes ahead. In 1978, OMF organized two conferences on China on the East and West Coasts of the United States. Zhao even revisited China in 1978, later publishing <em>The Church in China Today</em>, which reported on the struggles of the church under totalitarian rule and the ongoing revival of Christianity. In 1979, OMF established the ‚ÄúChina Ministry Department‚Äù in Hong Kong, with Zhao as the coordinator for the North American section, and he made several return visits to China.</p>
<p>Zhao Shiguang passed away in May 1994 in California.</p>

<p>China‚Äôs Christian Population (Ying 2009: 75-81)</p>
<p>Miner Searle Bates reported to the Foreign Missions Conference of North America in January 1942 that the number of communicant members in China was 600,000.</p>
<p>In 1949, the National Christian Council of China conducted a nationwide survey regarding the number of Christians in China. Although the data were incomplete, they should have a certain degree of authority. This survey was organized by Frank W. Price, initially published in early October 1949 and reprinted in January 1950, both being mimeographed trial editions with no differences between them. In December 1950, the council published a revised version in letterpress. Comparing the two, it can be seen that for the total number of ‚Äúmembers‚Äù, the January edition recorded 792,862 people (including 18 denominations), while the December edition recorded 902,805 people (including 21 denominations):</p>

<li>North China Christian Union, 1942 (Xing Fuzeng 2006: 104-121; Song Jun 2011: 197-220; Brook 1996: 331-337)</li>
</ol>
<p>On December 8, 1941, the Pacific War broke out, and Britain and America became belligerent nations against Japan, causing Christianity to be seen as a tool of Anglo-American influence. A large number of British and American missionaries in occupied areas were sent to concentration camps. The policy of the Japanese military towards Christianity in occupied areas was, on one hand, backed by coercive force, and on the other hand, it was a dual approach of ‚Äúappeasement‚Äù and ‚Äútransformation.‚ÄùIn relation to Christianity, there was a specific demand to establish an ‚Äúadaptive system,‚Äù which meant adopting Japan‚Äôs policy of transforming Christianity domestically, promoting a complete severance of ties between Christianity and Western denominations, and uniting various sects into the formation of a Christian alliance. Consequently, similar united Christian organizations were formed in various occupied areas. For instance, in 1942, the ‚ÄúManchurian Christian Church‚Äù was established by the united denominations of Christianity in Northeast China, ending the Manchurian Christian Alliance. In areas such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, the ‚ÄúEast China Christian Alliance‚Äù and the ‚ÄúSino-Japanese Christian Agreement Association‚Äù were formed, respectively. In Northwest China, the ‚ÄúMongolia and Xinjiang Christian Union‚Äù was created, while Shandong established the ‚ÄúShandong Chinese Christian Church,‚Äù and Hankou had the ‚ÄúCentral China Christian Federation.‚Äù</p>
<p>In North China, the ‚ÄúNorth China Christian United Promotion Association‚Äù was established in Beijing in April 1942. In September 1942, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the North China Political Affairs Committee convened various Christian churches for a North China Christian seminar. The seminar resolved three main points: (1) to quickly organize a North China Chinese Christian Union; (2) to draft a Christian faith outline; and (3) to draft a Chinese Christian constitution. To facilitate the early establishment of the union, the Japanese side convened the second preparatory meeting of the new union from October 12 to 14. At the same time, the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the implementation of the ‚ÄúTemporary Regulations for the Supervision of Christianity‚Äù and ‚ÄúTemporary Provisions for the Registration of Christian Missionaries.‚Äù The first article of the ‚ÄúRegulations‚Äù indicated that all Christianity and its affiliated enterprises in the jurisdiction of the North China Political Affairs Committee were to be supervised according to these regulations, and the second article explicitly stated that each denomination should agree to organize the North China Chinese Christian Union.</p>
<p>On October 15, the establishment ceremony of the North China Chinese Christian Union was held at Huairen Hall in Beijing, attended by more than twenty officials from the Sino-Japanese government, 83 representatives of pastoral staff from more than thirty churches across Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi provinces, and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, along with over 700 representatives of church members. Jiang Changchuan, a bishop of the Methodist Church of China, was elected as the head of the North China Christian Union, while Zhou Guanting, the secretary-general of the Beijing YMCA, was elected as the deputy head.</p>
<p>The North China Chinese Christian Union aimed to unify all denominations under one organization, with branch offices set up under the general assembly (Hebei Province, Shandong Province, Henan Province, Shanxi Province; with special branch offices in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao), district associations (a total of 25 district associations), and congregations. The educational group of the union established three levels of theological colleges: Level A is represented by the North China Central Christian Institute (Beijing), Level B includes three local institutes (Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong Teng County), and Level C is the Christian Theological Hall. Staff at Level A theological colleges had to be appointed from Japanese religious organizations, particularly the Level A and B colleges, which had to hire Japanese pastors and teachers. The content of theological thought was also required to be transformed into Eastern cultural thought, in line with the ‚Äúpolitical ideology of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Japanese government actively utilized religion in occupied areas to serve the war of aggression against China. On December 8, 1942, marking the first anniversary of the ‚ÄúGreater East Asia War,‚Äù the North China Christian Union was instructed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs to hold various activities, resulting in resolutions: (1) to hold peace prayer gatherings in various places; (2) to hold public lectures discussing livelihood issues; (3) to post slogans; and (4) to present flowers to injured soldiers from friendly nations and their own country as a gesture of consolation. In October 1943, to commemorate the anniversary of the North China Christian Union, peace prayer gatherings were held throughout the month.</p>

<li>Nanjing Chinese Christian Union 1943 (Matsutani Yosuke 2019: 231-239)</li>
</ol>
<p>In March 1942, the Nanjing Japanese-Chinese Christian Alliance was formed, with Shiro Kuroda from the Japanese Christian Church as president and Yang Shaocheng from the China Advent Christian Church as vice president. In 1943, Yang took over as president. The purpose of the alliance was to promote cooperation and mutual encouragement among Christians from Japan and China in Nanjing, aiming to establish the ‚Äúbanner of the pure gospel‚Äù in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as soon as possible. The declaration emphasized advancing based on the principles of Christian faith ‚Äúwith the righteousness of love and the spirit of sacrifice,‚Äù with the hope of early establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>In November 1942, the alliance hosted the ‚ÄúNanjing Japanese-Chinese Christian Guidance Training Conference,‚Äù attended by a total of 800 individuals from 25 Japanese and Chinese churches and organizations in Nanjing. In January 1943, Michio Kozaki, a leader of the Japanese Christian Union, came to China to promote church unity in various occupied areas of Central China. After attending the establishment ceremony of the Chinese Christian Union in Wuhu, he arrived in Nanjing on January 24.On January 27, the ‚ÄúNanjing Chinese Christian Union Preparatory Committee‚Äù was established, with Yang Shaocheng serving as chairman. On February 28, the official establishment of the ‚ÄúNanjing Chinese Christian Union‚Äù took place, with Yang Shaocheng as president and Shiro Kuroda, Yoshio Nagakura, and Yoshimune Abe serving as advisors. While the union was established, the alliance continued to exist, organizing prayer meetings and joint worship activities.</p>

<li>Central China Japanese-Chinese Christian Alliance 1942 (Matsutani Yosuke 2019: 253-260)</li>
</ol>
<p>In August 1942, the ‚ÄúCentral China Japanese-Chinese Christian Alliance‚Äù was established in Shanghai, with Yoshimune Abe as president and Yu Enzi and Shiro Kuroda as vice presidents. The founding declaration emphasized ‚Äúthe unity of the Chinese Christian Church at this moment, promoting self-reliant unity, Sino-Japanese cooperation, and evangelization.‚Äù It also mentioned the need to promote cooperation between Japanese and Chinese Christians in Central China to work towards realizing ‚Äúthe enhancement of Asia.‚Äù The alliance‚Äôs office was set up in the building of the National Christian Council of China in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In June 1944, the ‚ÄúJapanese-Chinese Christian Alliance Council‚Äù was held, also known as the ‚ÄúJapanese-Chinese Christian Leaders Spiritual Conference,‚Äù featuring speakers such as Michio Kozaki, director of the Japanese Christian Union‚Äôs East Asia Bureau, and Matsuyama J≈çjir≈ç, an advisor to the East Asia Bureau. The theme was ‚ÄúPromotion of Unity among Chinese Christian Churches,‚Äù indicating that to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, an East Asia Christian Union should be established. However, representatives from Chinese churches at the time, such as Li Zhaohuan (president of Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Lu Gancheng (secretary-general of the Shanghai YMCA), and Miao Qiusheng (secretary-general of the National Christian Council of China, who became vice president of the Central China Japanese-Chinese Christian Alliance in 1944), held a negative attitude towards the establishment of a Central China Christian Union or an East Asia Christian Union due to various reasons and difficulties. Therefore, the Central China Japanese Christian Alliance was not established.</p>

<li>United Christian Publishers, 1942 (Chen Jianming 2013: 312-322; Ho 1988: 143-146)</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wartime back, numerous Christian publishing institutions congregated in one place. However, due to the lack of paper and printing equipment during the war, along with financial shortages, publishing costs increased. In this situation, a plan to unify Christian literary institutions was proposed.</p>
<p>In September 1942, under the initiative and promotion of Wu Yaozong from the YMCA, an agreement was reached among Huaying Bookstore, the Guangxue Society, the YMCA Bookstore, and the biweekly ‚ÄúTianjia‚Äù to form the ‚ÄúUnited Christian Publishers,‚Äù with Wu serving as chairman of the executive committee, and Canadian missionary Charles Julius Pasmore Jolliffe as vice-chairman (succeeded by Margaret H. Brown in 1944 after Jolliffe‚Äôs retirement). Wu Yaozong believed that the united publishers could not only cope with difficulties but also set an example for the cooperative movement of Chinese Christianity.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the United Publishers, all units published and distributed under the name of the united publisher in a coordinated manner. Differences in theological and social issues among the publishers were handled respectfully.</p>
<p>In February 1943, the ‚ÄúChristian Periodical‚Äù was published, marking the first quarterly started after the establishment of the united publisher. In February 1945, the ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù weekly was published in Chengdu, also edited and distributed by the United Publishers. Additionally, it took over publications from other publishers (such as ‚ÄúÁ¶èÂπºÂ†±,‚Äù ‚ÄúÂ•≥Èê∏,‚Äù ‚ÄúÂ∏åÊúõÊúàÂàä,‚Äù etc.). In February 1944, the China Christian Literature Society joined, and in 1945, theËºâÁ§æ joined. From February 1943 to the end of 1945, the United Publishers published a total of 96 types of books, becoming a major Christian publishing institution during the war.</p>
<p>After the war, the ‚ÄúUnited Christian Publishers Association‚Äù was established in October 1945 as the managing body of the united publisher. In May 1946, the publisher moved from Chengdu to Shanghai. Due to various member publishing organizations relocating to Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, communication difficulties increased. At the same time, theological positions among members also diverged, especially regarding dissatisfaction with the more liberal theological tendencies of the united publisher. In November 1947, after negotiations among members, it was officially restructured into the ‚ÄúChina Christian Publishers Association,‚Äù which itself did not publish books or periodicals but was primarily responsible for promoting cooperation and coordination among members, while each member institution executed its own publishing and distribution plans.In 1948, the members of the association included: Alliance Bookstore, YMCA Bookstore, Huaying Bookstore, China Holy Scriptures Society, Guangxue Society, Youth Issues Monthly Society, Guangxie Bookstore, China Lutheran Church Book and Periodicals Society, Jinling Theological College Editing Department, Chinese Christian Religious Education Association, China Christian Holy Scriptures Bookstore, and Tianfeng Society.</p>

<li>Chungking Theological Seminary, 1944 (Xing Fuzeng 2001: 76-80)</li>
</ol>
<p>In October 1943, the China Inland Mission held a meeting in Chongqing to outline the principles for their post-war work. Frank Houghton, the general director, emphasized that the mission must ‚Äúserve through the local Chinese churches,‚Äù where missionaries would contribute their gifts and expertise through local congregations, participating as ordinary members. The China Inland Mission aimed to develop into an auxiliary of the church, extending a ‚Äúhelping hand‚Äù while moving away from a ‚Äúcontrolling hand,‚Äù collaborating with Chinese colleagues to promote evangelistic efforts. To implement this goal, the establishment of a theological seminary with a Chinese president became a topic of discussion. Houghton strongly believed that institutions led by Westerners could no longer meet the needs of Chinese churches.</p>
<p>As early as the end of 1938, Houghton had repeatedly invited Chen Chonggui to assist in establishing a seminary for the China Inland Mission. After further discussions in January 1944, both parties decided to collaborate to found Chungking Theological Seminary, with Chen Chonggui as president. Houghton emphasized that while the China Inland Mission would have some involvement in the establishment process, Chungking Theological Seminary was not a ‚Äúmission project,‚Äù but developed on an independent basis.</p>
<p>In March 1944, Chen Chonggui and Houghton jointly issued a founding declaration. In September of the same year, the seminary temporarily borrowed the premises of the China Inland Mission‚Äôs Yibin Church as its site, officially moving to Chongqing in May 1946. The seminary emphasized ‚Äúliving by faith, not soliciting donations, not borrowing debts, only accepting contributions from those whom God has moved to give.‚Äù Through this, they aimed to demonstrate the existence of God and the power of prayer. Additionally, faculty and students, regardless of their backgrounds, were encouraged to love one another and diligently maintain the unity granted by the Holy Spirit, thereby proving the fellowship and cooperation among Christians. Chungking Theological Seminary championed faith-based contributions. While the China Inland Mission was a collaborator, it was not the sole provider of funding and did not bear the primary economic responsibility. Their greatest support came in the form of personnel, as all salaries for Western missionaries teaching at the seminary were fully paid by the China Inland Mission.</p>
<p>In the personnel list for Chungking Theological Seminary in 1946, the faculty included: Chen Chonggui, Peng Lisheng (T. E. Benson), Gao Yusen (L. G. Gaussen), Bo Shengde (G. R. Bolster), Geng Mingde (M. C. Kent), He Weide (Thomas M. Ovid), Gao Zongshu, Huang Peiyong, and Ding Suxin. Except for Chen, Huang, and Ding, the rest were Western missionaries from the China Inland Mission.</p>
<p>It can be said that Chungking Theological Seminary became one of the institutions in the history of Chinese theological education that achieved results in Sino-Western cooperation. After 1949, due to Chen Chonggui‚Äôs active participation in the Three-Self Movement, Chungking Theological Seminary became one of the few seminaries exempted from consolidation after the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, continuing to train pastors in the southwest region. By 1959, the seminary could no longer escape the impact of the political tide and was merged into Jinling Union Theological Seminary in Nanjing.</p>

<li>Chinese Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship (CIVCF), 1945 (Liang Jialin 2001: 4-11; Zhao Junying 1981: 18-22)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the War of Resistance Against Japan, following the fall of various major cities, the Nationalist government relocated to the rear in Chongqing. Many national universities and church-affiliated universities also moved to the rear. At the same time, the Nationalist government established a few new universities in the rear to enroll refugee students. The concentration of a large number of refugee students in the southwest promoted the evangelistic work for students in the wartime rear. For example, Paul Contento from the China Inland Mission and Zhao Junying, who was in charge of the ‚ÄúChinese Native Evangelical Crusade,‚Äù were both dedicated to evangelizing among students.In the winter of 1944, Zhao Junying held a three-day evangelistic meeting at the joint campus of Chongqing Central University and Chongqing University, which was attended by a full auditorium, resulting in over 200 students making commitments.</p>
<p>In July 1945, the Evangelical Crusade was reorganized into the Chinese Evangelical Association. With support from foreign donations, Zhao Junying convened a summer spiritual retreat for Christian students from various Chinese universities, focusing on the Chongqing Spiritual Academy. Speakers at the event included Zhao himself, Jia Yuming, He Gengshi (Martin A. Hopkins), Zhang Jingyu, and Yin Renxian, notable figures from political and economic circles. A total of 169 students from 42 institutions across Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and other provinces participated. Before the conclusion of the summer retreat on July 21, the ‚ÄúChinese Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship‚Äù (Fellowship) was established, with Zhao Junying serving as the general secretary. The establishment of the Fellowship received strong support from the China Inland Mission, with additional involvement from Paul Contento and Leslie T. Lyall, as well as the appointment of Bishop Frank Houghton to send David Adeney to assist Zhao Junying.</p>
<p>After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, as universities relocated back to their original cities, the Fellowship‚Äôs work expanded in various places. At the time, among the 150 universities nationwide, 98 had fellowship groups connected with the Fellowship. By 1951, nearly 20,000 students had become Christians. The post-war headquarters of the Fellowship was located in Nanjing, with Zhao continuing as the general secretary and David Adeney as the deputy. The Fellowship also established an advisory board, with Jia Yuming becoming the first chief advisor. In 1947, students‚Äô fellowships from various countries united to form the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, holding the inaugural conference in Boston, USA, with Zhao Junying representing secondary schools.</p>
<p>In July 1947, the Fellowship convened the second National Christian Student Assembly in Nanjing, with speakers including Jia Yuming, Yang Shaotang, Zhao Zhaoying, and Frank Houghton. Over 500 students attended, and many made commitments during the gathering.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the ‚ÄúChinese Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship,‚Äù it emerged as a rival to the ‚ÄúNational Christian Student Union,‚Äù thus forming two opposing paths for the post-war Christian student movement in China.</p>

<li>The Launch of Tianfeng Weekly, 1945 (Wang Xiang 2007; Li Wenli 2024: 319-339; Xing Fuzeng 2018: li-lxiii)</li>
</ol>
<p>‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù is a Christian weekly that was established in February 1945 in Chengdu as part of the United Christian Publishers‚Äô ministry. After January 1, 1948, it was published under the name ‚ÄúTianfeng Society.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù was a highly politically charged Christian publication that arose from Wu Yaozong‚Äôs desire to create a platform for Christianity to address significant current affairs. It drew inspiration from the American liberal Christian publication ‚ÄúThe Christian Century.‚Äù In the inaugural issue titled ‚ÄúThe Future of China,‚Äù Wu Yaozong pointed out: ‚ÄúThis publication is a Christian periodical, and the fundamental assertion of Christianity regarding social life is freedom, equality, and fraternity. This assertion is based on the belief that God is the Father and humanity is the brotherhood. Much of modern democracy stems from this belief. Our mission is to apply this revolutionary belief to today‚Äôs issues in China, transforming crises into redemptive power for life.‚Äù The name ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù reflects the hope that during times of crisis, a ‚Äúfresh breeze from heaven‚Äù would help to clarify our confused minds, brighten our obscured vision, and rekindle our dull spirits.</p>
<p>In March 1946, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù suspended publication. In May, Wu Yaozong moved back to Shanghai, and ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù resumed publication in August in Shanghai. In the re-launch editorial titled ‚ÄúThe Mission of Christianity,‚Äù it emphasized that in the struggle to maintain and reform the status quo, Christians advocating for freedom, equality, and thorough democracy should be progressive revolutionaries. The current mission ‚Äúis to transform a society that enslaves and objectifies people into one that fully respects human value, preventing humanity from becoming embroiled in divisions and conflicts arising from self-interest and class opposition.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a subsequent editorial on its ‚ÄúFirst Anniversary,‚Äù this belief was reiterated: ‚ÄúChristianity is the greatest faith in the world; it is a revolutionary force and yeast. Despite being challenged by worldly forces, Christianity has never retreated; rather, it has always faced challenges squarely and will ultimately defeat all the evil forces of the world.‚ÄùIn January 1948, the Tianfeng Society was established, and ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù separated from the United Christian Publishers to become an independent ministry. Wu Yaozong explained in ‚ÄúWhere is ‚ÄòTianfeng‚Äô Going?‚Äù that independent publishing was aimed at gaining greater space and autonomy to continue its role as a ‚Äúprophetic voice.‚Äù</p>
<p>In April 1948, Wu Yaozong published an article titled ‚ÄúThe Tragic Era of Christianity‚Äù in ‚ÄúTianfeng,‚Äù criticizing Christianity for becoming a conservative force, aligning itself with the reactionary powers of capitalism and imperialism. As a result, this drew dissatisfaction from some missionaries. By June, he was forced to resign from his position as honorary editor, retaining only his membership on the editorial committee. Despite this, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù remained a platform for Christians concerned with current affairs and even leaned left in its stance. As the situation of the Chinese Civil War evolved, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù played an important role around the time of the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. In 1949, Wu Yaozong wrote in ‚ÄúTianfeng,‚Äù calling on the Chinese church to actively embrace the new China.</p>

</ol>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Shanghai International Settlement remained unaffected by the fighting. Within the settlement, headquarters of Christian organizations, such as the National Christian Council of China and the National Association of Christian (Women‚Äôs) Youth, were able to continue their operations. Several Christian universities, including Jinling University, Jinling Women‚Äôs University, Zhejiang University, and Soochow University, also relocated to the Shanghai International Settlement, combining with St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University, Hujiang University, and the Shanghai Medical College for Women to form the Shanghai Christian University Alliance. In 1938, Huazhong University relocated to Guilin but later moved again to Dali in Yunnan due to the advancing Japanese forces. The South China Women‚Äôs College of Arts and Sciences also moved from Fuzhou to Yanping (Nanping) in 1938.</p>
<p>In March 1941, the National Council decided to elect an extraordinary committee in Chengdu and establish an advisory committee for its Chongqing office. Following the Pearl Harbor incident, the Huaxi Extraordinary Committee was reorganized into an executive committee, with its headquarters in Chongqing. In response to wartime needs, in October 1942, several committees were established, including the Christian Social Service Committee, Wartime Relief Committee, China Wartime Service Committee, and Legal Advisory Committee. Later, a Christian Literature Ministry Committee was also added.</p>
<p>After the Pearl Harbor incident, Yenching University in Beiping was closed by the Japanese military. In February 1942, Yenching decided to reopen in the rear, ultimately selecting Chengdu due to existing institutions like Huaxi University, Qilu University, Jinling University, and Jinling Women‚Äôs University. Lingnan University relocated to Qujiang, while Hujiang co-operated with the Law School of Soochow University to establish the Soochow Hujiang Law and Business College. Zhejiang University moved to Shaowu in northwestern Fujian, joining the Fujian Union University, which had already relocated to Shaowu in 1938. The engineering college of Zhejiang University also moved from Shaowu to Guiyang in 1943.</p>
<p>St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University was the only Christian university that remained in the occupied area, with Yan Huqing serving as chairman of the board and Shen Silang as president. The deans of the various colleges were also replaced with Chinese leaders.</p>

<li>Study Conference on Post-War Work in China, 1944 (Ge Deliang 1944; Ling 1999: 63-68)</li>
</ol>
<p>In June 1943, the North American Foreign Missions Association decided to establish the ‚ÄúPost-War Church Work Planning Committee for China,‚Äù working in cooperation with the National Christian Council of China. To this end, the council‚Äôs general secretary, Wu Gaozi, collaborated with R. M. Cross from the North American Baptist Convention headquarters to gather opinions from various countries. However, due to Cross‚Äôs health issues, this was continued by Wu Gaozi alone.</p>
<p>Between September 6 and October 14, 1943, the North American Foreign Missions Association held ten conferences in ten cities across the United States, mainly attended by local furloughed missionaries and Chinese Christians, to collect their insights. The conference mainly discussed multiple aspects of post-war church work in China: (1) Chinese Christian leaders; (2) how to train talent; (3) lay leaders; (4) lay congregants (volunteers); (5) urban churches; (6) rural churches; (7) the establishment of Christian families; (8) evangelistic work; (9) educational work; (10) higher education; (11) theological and Bible schools; (12) secondary education; (13) religious education; (14) hospitals, public health, and health education; (15) literature work and literacy eradication; (16) the application of new technologies; (17) church unity issues; (18) the National Christian Council. Additionally, various topics regarding missionary societies and missionaries were discussed: (1) the shortcomings of missionaries; (2) housing and home life of missionaries; (3) the work of missionaries; (4) the training and dispatch policies for missionaries; (5) relief and demobilization work; (6) missionary societies; (7) the land and properties of missionary societies; (8) the headquarters of missionary societies.</p>
<p>The report, written by Frank T. Cartwright, was submitted to the ‚ÄúPost-War Church Work Planning Committee for China‚Äù on November 24-25, 1944. The report, titled ‚ÄúThe Church and Future in China,‚Äù primarily examined the relationship between the post-war church in China and missionary societies, especially the integration of societies and churches, ensuring that personnel, funding, and church properties were centered around the church district. However, these recommendations were not implemented after the war, as the post-war Chinese church still needed to rely on financial support from missionary societies, and missionaries were not adequately prepared to transfer authority.(3) Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs Address to the National Churches 1944 (Chiang Kai-shek 1945: 2041-2042)</p>
<p>On Christmas 1944, Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech that was published in the January 1945 issue of the ‚ÄúRevival‚Äù magazine by the Central Training Corps of the Kuomintang. In his speech, he reflected on his journey with the Christian faith and how, during the period of opposition to Christianity, ‚Äúdue to the world‚Äôs opposition to the church, I approached the study of the reasons against Christian doctrine and the content of Christian teachings with a skeptical attitude.‚Äù Ultimately, he concluded that ‚Äúto know Christ is to realize He is not only the Savior of the world but also a mentor for national revolution, social revolution, and religious revolution.‚Äù Furthermore, he believed this aligned with ‚Äúthe fundamental spirit of our Three People‚Äôs Principles.‚Äù</p>
<p>He pointed out that China had suffered from Japan‚Äôs ‚Äúmad invasion‚Äù for the past eight years, particularly in that year when his compatriots endured immense pain and disaster. For the countless individuals trampled by enemy forces and the refugees left homeless in the rear, God and the Savior offered the hope of ‚Äúworld peace‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman fraternity,‚Äù granting the Chinese people greater confidence ‚Äúto repel evil forces and overcome the defiled and polluted land.‚Äù The promise of ‚Äúworld peace‚Äù announced by the angels on the eve of Christ‚Äôs birth was nearing fulfillment.</p>
<p>Chiang went on to say that the life, character, education, and spirit of service and sacrifice of Jesus Christ encourage humanity to strive forward and ‚Äúcreate a new world of freedom, equality, and peace.‚Äù Therefore, the ‚ÄúKingdom of Heaven‚Äù is not ‚Äúa distant future‚Äù; it can be realized now by ‚Äúall who have a faith-based purpose for peace and love.‚Äù He thus called on all Christians and church groups nationwide to pray for the nation, ‚Äúso that all our compatriots may awaken to a sense of national consciousness,‚Äù and to ‚Äúconfess our sins‚Äù and ‚Äúthe various weaknesses of our nation and all the faults of our state,‚Äù asking God for ‚Äúmerciful guidance and protection.‚Äù The national churches should provide exceptional service for the rescue of wounded soldiers and relief of refugees ‚Äúin the forthcoming final victory year‚Äù to fulfill our Christian duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>He mentioned that during the Xi‚Äôan Incident, he gained strength from faith and truth. He concluded by saying, ‚ÄúMay all our compatriots, whether they are in free areas or occupied zones, regardless of their religious beliefs, reaffirm their faith on this day of light and hope, recognizing that God will reward those who do not compromise with evil with victory and everlasting peace. On this Christmas Day, let us pray together as a national church and as compatriots to firmly adhere to this faith.‚Äù</p>

<li>Declaration of Chinese Christians on Current Affairs 1946 (Tianfeng 1946: 11)</li>
</ol>
<p>In August 1946, twelve Chinese Christians published a ‚ÄúDeclaration on Current Affairs‚Äù in ‚ÄúTianfeng,‚Äù expressing their opinions based on a Christian perspective about the present situation in China. The declaration included: (1) In the face of the intense ‚Äúinternal conflict,‚Äù Christians, regardless of their ‚ÄúChristian altruism or humanitarianism,‚Äù must call for peace. After eight years of war against Japan, the situation has become dire, and further conflict is untenable. Therefore, ‚Äúwe demand both sides abandon armed struggle and adopt peaceful negotiation methods,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe are willing to call upon our fellow believers and all compatriots intolerant of internal strife to express strong public opinion, striving for peace within the country‚Äù; (2) ‚ÄúWe will advocate for the basic freedoms of the people.‚Äù As children of God, ‚Äúpeople are the ends, not the means,‚Äù thus the public should enjoy freedoms of thought, speech, publication, assembly, and the right to religious expression. Any laws, orders, and political measures contradicting this, as well as violence and terror, must be abolished and stopped to allow a democratic nation to align its principles with its practice; (3) ‚ÄúWe demand a thorough reform of the current political situation.‚Äù Due to corruption, public sentiment has become disappointed and pessimistic following victory. To correct the root causes, immediate cessation of internal strife is necessary, alongside convening a national congress to draft a constitution, practice democratic elections, and reorganize the government.</p>
<p>The twelve Chinese Christians included: Diao Xinde (acting president of St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University), Li Peien (president of Zhejiang University), Wu Gaozi (general secretary of the National Christian Council of China), Shao Jingsan (general secretary of the Nanjing Christian Church), Tu Yuqing (professor at Hujiang University), Liang Xiaochu (general secretary of the National Association of Christian Youth of China), Cui Xianxiang (general secretary of the National Council of the Christian Church), Peng Fu (bishop of the China Lutheran Church), Cai Kui (general secretary of the National Women‚Äôs Christian Association), Zheng Hefu (bishop of the Henan Diocese of the China Anglican Church), and Bao Zheqing (general secretary of the Zhejiang-Shanghai Baptist Church).(5) Forward Movement of the National Christian Council, 1947 (Luo Weihong 2014: 619-623)</p>
<p>In July 1946, the National Christian Council of China relocated from Chongqing back to Shanghai, and from December 3 to 11, it held its 12th annual meeting, the first such meeting in nine years since the 11th meeting in 1937. The theme of the meeting was ‚ÄúThe Church of Christ and the Future of China,‚Äù presenting the slogan ‚ÄúAll for Christ, Christ for One,‚Äù urging all churches to rise from pessimism and despair by emphasizing that the country‚Äôs reconstruction requires a spirit grounded in morality. To this end, the ‚ÄúThree-Year Forward Movement‚Äù was introduced. The movement was chaired by Bishop Ralph A. Ward of the Methodist Church as the head of the ‚ÄúChristian Advancement Committee,‚Äù with the first year (starting January 1947) focusing on personal advancement; the second year (starting January 1948) aimed at advancing China to achieve the ideal of ‚ÄúChina returned to the Lord‚Äù; and the third year (starting in 1949) sought to align with the global Christian movement. However, in early 1948, the committee suggested extending the movement by one year, changing the 1947 year to a preparatory year, making the three-year period from 1948 to 1950. In December 1947, Victor Hayward was appointed as the director of the Forward Movement, and in April 1948, Frank W. Price also joined the initiative.</p>
<p>The Forward Movement proposed the overarching goal of ‚Äúcomplete Christianization,‚Äù divided into four objectives: (1) to increase the number of dedicated Christians, allowing believers to experience new life; (2) to strengthen the church‚Äôs capacity, making it the center of spiritual construction; (3) to encourage cooperation among various churches; (4) to elevate the spiritual life of communities and the entire nation, striving to promote the gospel and build a new China characterized by peace and democracy.</p>
<p>In 1948, the movement focused evangelistic work on three areas: Christian rural development, Christian industry, and the Christian family movement. The first two had been ongoing ministries of the Council since the 1920s, while the latter became a response to the increasing dominance of the Communist Party during the Chinese Civil War, proposing that if the church faced persecution and religious freedom was restricted, religion could be brought into the home.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Northwest Frontier Evangelism Movement (Liang Jialin 2001: 220-223; Deng Zhaoming 1998: 231-236)</li>
</ol>
<p>During the War of Resistance, a significant number of Christians migrated from the coastal areas to the southwestern hinterlands of China, recognizing the need for evangelism in the frontier regions. After the war, various evangelistic teams specifically aimed at frontier missions were formed.</p>
<p>In 1942, James Hudson Taylor II, president of the Northwest Bible College in Fengxiang, Shaanxi, encouraged students to engage in evangelistic work across the five northwestern provinces (Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang). Teacher Ma Yin-tang (also known as Ma Ke) established a seven-member prayer group to pray for the evangelization back to Jerusalem. A large map outlining the five provinces was drawn on a wall at the college, prompting students to pray for each province, with those moved to stand at the location of their respective province. This led to more than 70 faculty and students feeling inspired, resulting in a weekly prayer for the evangelization of the northwest. Later, based on Matt 24:14, the movement was named the ‚ÄúUniversal Evangelism Mission,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúUniversal Evangelism Report‚Äù was founded.</p>
<p>In 1946, Ma took over as president, but due to the civil war, the Northwest Bible College closed in 1948. Ma then moved to Chongqing in Sichuan, and the Universal Evangelism Mission became largely inactive. However, graduates such as Zhao Maijia, He Enzheng, and Huang Qingzhi devoted themselves to evangelism in the frontier regions, working in Xinjiang and collaborating with the Northwest Spiritual Work Group to spread the gospel.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúNorthwest Spiritual Work Group‚Äù was founded in 1948 by Pastor Zhang Guquan, who had studied at a theological college in North China and then conducted evangelistic tours in Shandong. In 1946, he established a spiritual formation institute in Weixian, enrolling refugees. Later, he decided to lead students from the spiritual formation institute to Xinjiang to develop evangelistic work through ‚Äúimmigrant missions.‚Äù Between 1948 and 1949, he and Li Shiying led nearly a hundred students interested in frontier evangelism from Lanzhou, Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, Yumeng, and Dihua, finally settling in Hami. There, they lived communally, establishing the ‚ÄúWorkers‚Äô Home,‚Äù later renamed the ‚ÄúNorthwest Spiritual Work Group.‚Äù In 1949, they launched the ‚ÄúNorthwest Spiritual Work‚Äù publication.</p>
<p>In 1948, Ding John, Tian Wending, Zhu Yimin, and Zhu Xiumei formed the ‚ÄúChristian Frontier Mission Team,‚Äù focusing on evangelizing ethnic minorities in the Kangding region.(7) An Open Letter to Foreign Missions, 1949 (Xing Fuzeng 2012: 273-275)</p>
<p>The open letter titled ‚ÄúTo Our American Brother: A Message from the Christians of China‚Äù was issued in English to foreign missionary societies and translated into Chinese by the Tianfeng Society, published as a special feature in the November 1949 issue of ‚ÄúTianfeng.‚Äù The letter was signed by 19 prominent Christians, including: Jiang Changchuan (Chairman of the North China Christian Union and Bishop of the Methodist Church in North China), Wu Gaozi (General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China), Hu Zuyin (Volunteer General Secretary of the Guangxue Society), Shao Jingsan (General Secretary of the Nanjing Christian Church), Wu Yifang (President of Jinling Women‚Äôs College), Tu Yuqing (General Secretary of the National Association of Christian Youth), Cui Xianxiang (General Secretary of the National Council of the Christian Church), Miao Qiusheng (Executive Secretary of the Christian Education Promotion Association), Li Zhaohuan (Chairman of the National Association of Christian Youth and President of the Shanghai Christian Benevolence Society), Quan Shaowen (Executive Committee Member of the National Christian Council), Chen Yuguang (President of Jinling University), Wang Peizhen (Principal of Shanghai Private Biwen Women‚Äôs School), Lin Buji (Secretary of the Central Office of the Anglican Church), Cai Kui (General Secretary of the National Women‚Äôs Christian Association), Lin Tiandu (Executive Secretary of the China Christian Publishers Association), Lu Meizeng (Secretary of the National Association of Christian Youth), as well as Sun Ensan, Zhu Lanjin, Nie Lingyu, among others. These individuals held significant positions within the church and represented national Christian organizations (the Council, the Youth Association), denominations (Methodist Church, Christian Church, Anglican Church, Christian Association), educational institutions (Nanjing Women‚Äôs College, Jinling University), and publishing (Guangxue Society, China Christian Publishers Association), with 11 of them also serving on the executive committee of the National Council. They decided to write to the missions of the British and American churches ‚Äúin their individual capacities,‚Äù which merits further investigation into their motives. During the East Asia Christian Conference held in Bangkok in December 1949 by the World Council of Churches, the representatives from China were unable to attend, and the open letter was included as a report from the Chinese churches, indicating its impact. Later, ‚ÄúThe Christian Century‚Äù published the full text of this open letter.</p>
<p>The open letter expressed hope that Western churches would understand the current situation in China, emphasizing that the changes of the times necessitated a reevaluation of the relationship between the Chinese church and the ‚Äúadvanced foreign churches.‚Äù It urged foreign friends to be aware of the difficulties faced by the Chinese church, particularly the challenges posed by policy changes and adjustments in foreign relations. ‚ÄúWe should not rely solely on hope and fantasy,‚Äù but rather grasp the changes brought about by the new circumstances. Regarding the relationship between the Chinese church and the missionary societies, the 19 signatories wrote: ‚ÄúIn the past, under the shield of unequal treaties, the Chinese church indeed enjoyed certain privileges. In reality, the Chinese church had close ties with the English and American churches in personnel and finance. The life and organization of the Chinese church were built upon the methods of the English and American models; the tradition of foreign denominationalism had also taken root in China. Much of the church‚Äôs administrative authority remained in the hands of Western missionaries, and in many instances, church policies were still determined by foreign mission societies.‚Äù Confronting this new era, ‚ÄúWe have now reached a time when we need to strengthen our capacity to realize our policies without straying off course.‚Äù</p>
<p>Finally, they made three suggestions to the Western missionary societies: (1) The decision-making power regarding policies and economic management should be handed over to Chinese leaders, with a systematic plan to achieve self-sufficiency; (2) Missionaries must accept the new circumstances and challenges, working and serving in difficult environments, with their contributions shifting from administrative management to ‚Äústaying, sharing, living‚Äù; (3) The Chinese church still requires economic assistance from abroad, but the funding from missionary societies must come without conditions.</p>
<p>This open letter clearly indicated that in light of the new situation, foreign missionary societies must adjust their policies, while the Chinese church must reform toward the principles of ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù and ‚Äúself-sufficiency.‚Äù The denominations and organizations represented by these church leaders maintained close ties with Western missionary societies, and missionaries still held considerable administrative power. Their choice to express their views in their personal capacity can be seen as a ‚Äúcounsel‚Äù to Western missionaries and societies.</p>

<li>The Withdrawal of Christian Endeavors to Hong Kong (Xing Fuzeng 2004: 122-125, 132-135)</li>
</ol>
<p>During the period of the Chinese Civil War, many Christian endeavors gradually relocated to Hong Kong.In terms of theological institutions, as early as the fall of 1946, Bethel Theological Seminary was reopened in Shanghai. Soon after, the president, Lan Ruxi, received a letter from Qi Zhiwen, who was then in Hong Kong, stating that he had witnessed many affluent and prominent individuals in Shanghai moving to Hong Kong. Considering the rapidly changing situation in China, he suggested that Lan Ruxi relocate the seminary to Hong Kong as soon as possible, or else there would be no opportunities for work following the liberation of Shanghai. In February 1947, Lan Ruxi led all faculty and students to Hong Kong by boat, and classes officially resumed in March. In December 1948, the Lutheran Theological Seminary, originally located in Hubei, decided to relocate to Hong Kong due to the impact of the civil war, resuming classes at the Christian monastic retreat at Daofeng Mountain. In 1949, as the civil war intensified and the Nationalist Army faced continuous defeats, J. E. Morrison, president of the Holy Spirit Bible School, decided to evacuate from Guangzhou and reopened in Hong Kong in July. During the summer break, the Guangzhou Bible School also relocated from Guangzhou to resume classes in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Additionally, many Christian publishing institutions originally based in China also moved to Hong Kong or established branches there. The General Committee of the Chinese Bible Society, headquartered in Shanghai, decided in 1948 to send a Western secretary, David McGavin, to Hong Kong to consider relocating the printing of Chinese Bibles. Upon his arrival, he contacted the Hong Kong Bible Society, using their office, and began work by the end of 1949. The Bibles that had been printed could no longer be transported to Shanghai and had to be unloaded in Hong Kong. In early 1949, the headquarters of the China Inland Mission decided to relocate its literature department from Shanghai to Hong Kong, led by Kenneth H. Price and his wife. After their arrival, by the end of 1949, they had published over thirty types of gospel tracts in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In March 1949, Paul H. Bartel of the Alliance Church arrived in Cheung Chau to arrange for the resumption of work at the Alliance Bookstore. Furthermore, the China Sunday School Union, originally headquartered in Shanghai, decided in 1949 to appoint Dr.&nbsp;John Montgomery, a Presbyterian missionary, to establish branches in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In 1949, Ni Tuosheng instructed the Local Assembly to establish gospel bookstores in Hong Kong and Taipei, managed by Wei Guangxi and Li Changshou, respectively. Under the arrangements at that time, books published by the Local Assembly had shared copyright across Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.</p>

<li>The Retention and Withdrawal of Missionaries (Xing Fuzeng 2012: 264-270; Ling 1999: 88-94)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the victory in the War of Resistance, the number of missionaries in China peaked at 4,062 (including 780 on furlough). However, the Chinese Civil War introduced further instability to missionary work, and the victory of the Communist movement cast a significant shadow over the prospects for missionary endeavors in China. By the end of 1948, with the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of Northeast China and the critical situation on the Pingjin front, the liberation of North China was only a matter of time, making the decision to retreat or not an urgent matter for mission societies.</p>
<p>In November 1948, the National Christian Council of China held its 13th annual meeting, specifically discussing whether missionaries should withdraw from liberated areas. The representatives present unanimously agreed that the church must remain steadfast at its post, but individual missionaries could decide whether to stay or leave based on the specific circumstances of their locations. The council also resolved not to move its headquarters out of Shanghai.</p>
<p>In December, 19 Chinese Christians issued a letter to European and American missionary societies and missionaries, stating that the Chinese church needed missionaries now more than at any point in history, urging them to testify for God alongside Chinese believers. Conversely, they warned that a hasty retreat by missionaries would severely impact the morale of the Chinese church. The 19 signatories included: Ou Weiguo (Chairman of St.&nbsp;John‚Äôs University), Bao Zheqing (Honorary General Secretary of the China Christian Baptist Association and Chairman of the National Christian Council of China), Zhang Fuliang (Christian Church of China), Quan Shaowen (Executive Committee Member of the National Christian Council of China), Hu Zuyin (General Secretary of the Guangxue Society), Ying Shugu (Accountant of the National Christian Council), Henry Lin, Lin Tiandu (Executive Secretary of the China Christian Publishers Association), Lu Meizeng (Secretary of the National Association of Christian Youth), Luo Yunyan (Chairman of the Publishing Department of the Methodist Church of China), Li Zhaohuan (Chairman of the National Association of Christian Youth), Mao Kezhong (Bishop of the Anglican Church of China), Miao Qiusheng (Executive Secretary of the Christian Education Promotion Association), Robert Sheng, Cai Kui (General Secretary of the National Women‚Äôs Christian Association), Cui Xianxiang (General Secretary of the National Council of the Christian Church), Wu Gaozi (General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China), Wu Keming (President of Qilu University), and S. U. Zau.Under the shadow of potential persecution, some missionaries in North China began to plan to move south, largely congregating in Shanghai to observe the further developments of the situation. Due to the unstable political climate in China, the U.S. government issued an evacuation order in November 1948, calling for residents in North China and provinces such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian to withdraw. However, only 137 missionaries expressed willingness to return home, most of whom were the elderly or weak, representing less than one-tenth of the American missionaries in China. Conversely, some missionaries who had originally moved to Qingdao, upon learning about the situation in the liberated areas of Hebei and Shandong, decided to cancel their withdrawal plans and remain in Qingdao, waiting for opportunities to return to their original fields of work. After the Communist Party took control of the Pingjin area, they indicated that foreign missionaries would be allowed to continue living and working in the liberated areas. Schools and hospitals run by foreigners could also maintain their status, alleviating concerns for numerous missionaries and church members.</p>
<p>In January 1949, the North American Foreign Missions Association held its annual meeting, where representatives from 61 Protestant denominations in the U.S. unanimously agreed to remain in China. The Chinese Committee associated with the association held multiple informal meetings from late 1948 to 1949 to discuss conditions in various mission fields across China. In May, the committee held a two-day meeting in New York with 32 representatives from different mission societies and leaders from the Chinese church to discuss topics such as Christianity and the Communist movement in China. At the end of the meeting, they issued a position statement titled ‚ÄúChristian Mission in China,‚Äù discussing responses to Communist policies and the role of missionary societies. They reiterated that missionary societies and missionaries must remain committed to their mission. Similarly, the Conference of British Missionary Societies also believed that British missionaries should not withdraw to assist their Chinese colleagues during difficult times. The Presbyterian Church in the USA decided to essentially maintain their operations and strengthen them if needed. The Methodist Church also resolved to ‚Äúwalk the difficult path together with our Chinese coworkers. We firmly believe that Christ walks with the Chinese people there, and we hope to align ourselves with them and Him.‚Äù However, some societies adopted a more pessimistic view: the Southern Baptist Convention withdrew its missionaries from Shandong and Henan in early 1949, and the headquarters in Shanghai relocated to Hong Kong in March. The American Lutheran Church also decided to withdraw missionaries from the liberated areas. Nevertheless, most missionary societies allowed their missionaries to make their own decisions regarding staying or leaving based on the actual circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Charles L. Boynton, it was estimated that between April and September 1948, about 3,000 missionaries were in China. As the situation developed, the number of missionaries choosing to leave China increased. Frank T. Cartwright, Chairman of the Chinese Committee of the North American Foreign Missions Association, estimated that before and after the establishment of the new China, about 2,000 missionaries remained, with over half (1,100) being American missionaries.</p>
<p>The vast majority of missionaries staying in China were affiliated with the China Inland Mission (CIM). According to a survey by the National Christian Council, as of July 1949, the CIM still had 770 personnel stationed at mission fields in China. As early as December 1948, the CIM held an important staff meeting at its Shanghai headquarters to discuss how to respond to the current situation. Bishop Frank Houghton, the general director, believed that the new regime would want to maintain some international connections and would, to some extent, respect foreign public opinion, and would not casually attack or mistreat foreigners holding legal passports. He also believed that the new leaders would adopt a pragmatic policy toward foreign missionaries. While some staff had differing opinions, Houghton emphasized that since God had called them to serve China, ‚Äúwould He then retract this calling?‚Äù Ultimately, the meeting decided that missionaries should not withdraw, asserting that even in areas soon to be captured by Communist forces, they should remain at their posts. Individual missionaries who chose to leave would effectively resign from the CIM. Soon afterward, Houghton formally wrote in the CIM‚Äôs publication ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Millions,‚Äù stating clearly that the CIM would not withdraw during the current crisis in China. In letters sent to missionaries throughout the country, he reminded everyone that they must understand the present situation in the light of eternity and trust in God‚Äôs protection. In response to suggestions that the CIM relocate missionaries to new fields, Houghton stated, ‚ÄúThe call to China remains paramount. The new circumstances necessitate our recommitment, courage, and obedience.‚ÄùThe development of the situation prompted the China Inland Mission (CIM) to temporarily set aside theological differences and participate in the Emergency Council initiated by the National Christian Council of China, working together to monitor and discuss countermeasures. By the end of 1949, the CIM still had 706 missionaries stationed in China, and an additional 49 newly appointed missionaries were sent to China. Houghton believed that God had not abandoned China, and that the CIM could still seek collaboration with the Chinese church under the new regime.</p>

</ol>
<p>On April 5, 1949, John Mott stopped in Shanghai for 20 hours while on his way from the Philippines to South Korea. During this time, he convened an emergency meeting with more than 70 missionaries and Chinese church leaders to discuss response measures for missionary work in the wake of the ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù Mott stated that ‚Äúthe American church will never abandon the Chinese church,‚Äù expressing confidence that Chinese church leaders could carry out ministry in complex circumstances. He also emphasized the ‚Äúuniversality of Christianity,‚Äù hoping to maintain connections between the Chinese church and the global church. Before the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of Shanghai on May 19, the National Christian Council called an emergency meeting of missionaries, establishing the ‚ÄúChristian Consultative Council,‚Äù which included Victor E. W. Hayward, Ralph Mortensen, Ralph A. Ward, William P. Roberts, and several Chinese church leaders. The council established a five-member steering committee that met every two weeks, primarily to share updates and discuss strategies for significant situations.</p>

<li>The Response in Christian Education (Xing Fuzeng 2012: 178-183)</li>
</ol>
<p>In January 1949, the United Board for Christian Colleges in China also decided to adopt a ‚Äúpositive and courageous policy‚Äù to respond to the changing circumstances in China. Their public statement indicated that as long as Christian universities in China could operate according to their Christian principles, the board would continue to provide comprehensive support.</p>
<p>On January 22, 1949, more than 80 presidents of various Christian colleges and universities in East China held a discussion meeting in Shanghai to broadly address the adaptation issues facing church schools. Regarding basic policies and curricula, there was consensus that reforms were necessary to overcome the shortcomings of traditional education, free themselves from the constraints of capitalist ideology, and implement the true essence of Christianity: democratization of education, socialization of education, and production-oriented education. At the same time, they emphasized that Christian schools would not abandon their sacred mission of spreading the gospel of Christ, hence they should fight for religious freedom. Economically, the schools advocated for self-sufficiency and sought to both increase income and reduce expenses. In terms of religious education, they proposed that religious work should be integrated into daily life to influence students through their activities and behavior and to explore new possibilities for religious education (such as cooperation with local churches).</p>
<p>After the liberation of East China, administrative personnel from Shanghai Christian schools convened a forum on June 11, attended by around 100 representatives. In discussing the current difficulties faced by church schools, attendees pointed out that since the liberation, the ‚ÄúStudent Federation‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeaching Federation‚Äù in various cities had bypassed school administrations and directly instructed student and faculty activities, causing frequent instances of student absenteeism and faculty lack of attendance. Additionally, religious courses and activities that were previously mandatory had to be changed to elective or voluntary participation. On July 14, a meeting of principals and academic administrators from Christian secondary schools in Beijing and Shanghai was held at Qingxin Middle School in Shanghai, with representatives also attending from Zhejiang and Anhui. Due to the earlier liberation in the Pingjin area, local principals shared experiences, particularly regarding post-liberation government policies on private schools and the relationship between church schools and the military administration‚Äôs educational departments, as well as the student and teaching federations. Participants also reviewed the successes and failures of past administrative practices in Christian schools and thoroughly discussed administrative arrangements such as school boards and governing bodies.In August, the China Christian Education Association dispatched officials to North China (including Beijing, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, etc.) to visit and further understand the circumstances of various church schools. The findings were summarized as follows: (1) All schools were conducting studies on new democracy; (2) There must be a separation of religion and education, with all religious activities required to be held in churches outside of school; (3) Society and the government recognized the teaching efforts of church schools but were concerned about their religious education and their Anglo-American backgrounds; (4) The greatest misunderstanding faced by Christian schools was being perceived by the government as instruments of imperialism, necessitating that each school prove their funding came from the people of the U.S. and England rather than from the government.</p>
<p>In November, Zhang Wenchang, the director of the association, began a visit to Central China, covering the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and others. He visited 12 cities, including Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanchang, Jinhua, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing, interacting with four Christian universities and 41 Christian secondary schools. This visit provided a more comprehensive understanding of the situation of church schools in the six provinces after liberation. Compared to the circumstances in North China, several noteworthy points emerged: (1) There were concerns about the future of foreign subsidies, and because tuition fees at church schools were generally higher, even with reductions in response to student circumstances, competition with public schools was challenging, leading to an increase in students dropping out or transferring to public schools; (2) Internally, there was some degree of dissonance regarding political ideology and religious education issues within schools. Additionally, lower-level government officials exhibited some discrepancies in policy implementation; (3) What would be the future for church schools? Would private institutions retain their status? Could the characteristics of Christian schools be maintained?</p>
<p>According to the association‚Äôs reports, instances of principals resigning from various church schools were not uncommon. For example, principals from Zhejiang University, Hujiang University, Hangzhou Zilan Middle School, Shanghai St.&nbsp;Mary‚Äôs Girls‚Äô School, Ningbo Zhedong Middle School, and Yangzhou M. J. Greene School all submitted their resignations. The challenges faced by church schools across the regions were summarized as follows: (1) Economically, there was uncertainty regarding the future of accepting foreign subsidies, facing financial pressure due to increased operational costs and decreased student numbers. (2) Administratively, schools needed to negotiate with local educational departments, and various schools also established student councils and faculty unions, increasing the influence of student associations and teaching federations. Relationships among school principals, churches, school boards, and external organizations became increasingly complex. (3) In terms of curriculum, while political education was being emphasized, religious education tended to be marginalized. Additionally, new youth groups promoting new democracy were formed in Christian schools, advocating against superstition, which inevitably created tension.</p>
<p>To discuss the prospects of Christian education in the new China, the China Christian Education Association planned to hold a national conference on higher and secondary Christian education in Beijing in the fall of 1949, inviting representatives from various regions and schools. However, officials from the Central People‚Äôs Government suggested that the Christian education conference should take place after the national educational work conference. In October, the association learned that the national educational work conference was scheduled for winter, deciding to hold the representative meeting for national Christian educators immediately after that conference, with the overarching theme being ‚ÄúHow to Improve Christian Education to Align with New Democracy.‚Äù However, in a December notification, the association stated that ‚Äúdue to the postponement of the national educators‚Äô representative conference that the People‚Äôs Government will convene until next spring, and because those holding administrative roles in schools would find it inconvenient to leave during the holidays, along with the cold weather in Beijing, the conference will be postponed until March next spring.‚Äù The primary reason for the conference‚Äôs postponement was the lack of government approval. On January 23, 1950, the Executive Committee in Shanghai held an emergency meeting to decide that if government approval was obtained, the national conference would hope to proceed as scheduled, without waiting for the national educational work conference. However, just a few days later (on January 26), the conference organizing committee learned that government approval had still not been granted, and it was decided that Director Zhang Wenchang and committee chairman Principal Shen Tilan would jointly write to Li Weiheng of the United Front Work Department and the Ministry of Education to apply for permission. The committee then renamed the conference ‚ÄúNational Conference of Christian Schools in China,‚Äù with the meeting set for April. In May, the organizing committee officially announced that the conference would be held from August 7 to 12, either at Yenching University or Huiwen Middle School. Yet in June, it was announced that the meeting would be postponed. The national Christian education conference faced multiple delays and was ultimately canceled, largely depending on the government‚Äôs stance.(12) The Adaptation of Christian Publishing Work (Xing Fuzeng 2012: 220-221, 226)</p>
<p>In July 1949, the China Christian Publishers Association published an article titled ‚ÄúThings Christians Should Learn in the New Era‚Äù in its journal ‚ÄúChina Bookman,‚Äù outlining directions for learning in the new era: (1) Learning about the new era; (2) Learning new ideas; (3) Learning new knowledge; (4) Learning new work. The Christian publishing work must adapt to the new era, with the editors believing that with adequate preparation, ‚Äúnot only can we survive alongside the times, but the truth of Christianity can endure; and we can also lead the times forward, allowing Christianity and other truths, and ideologies, to complement and converge harmoniously; existing together without contradiction. Doing so, we will preserve both the new wine and the new wineskins, and we can avoid being swayed by every wind of false teachings, building our faith upon the solid rock of unchanging truth.‚Äù</p>
<p>Wu Yaozong, the director of the publishing department of the YMCA, also expressed his hopes for the Christian publishing industry in the same issue of ‚ÄúChina Bookman.‚Äù On one hand, he was confident that the new regime would realize religious freedom, so long as the published materials were not reactionary or superstitious, there would be freedom of publication. He believed that even critiques of communism, if made in good faith and based on academic grounds, would be permissible. On the other hand, he acknowledged that the new era posed ‚Äúa tremendous challenge,‚Äù as with the establishment of the new China, the focus of Christian publishing would no longer be on the ‚Äúurgent need for passive spiritual comfort‚Äù as it had been during the war, but rather ‚Äúto emphasize the positivity and revolutionary nature of Christianity‚Äù to meet the needs of the new era. He asserted that as long as Christian publishing could reform under these overarching principles, ‚Äúits future would be bright.‚Äù</p>
<p>At the Shanghai Christian Authors‚Äô Fellowship meeting held at the end of July 1949, Wu Yaozong summarized three stances that Christian publishing faced in the new era: First, to engage in debate with materialism, being willing to sacrifice for faith as martyrs; second, regardless of external circumstances, to simply follow their own path. He described these two positions as holding an anti-communist attitude, which was destined to fail. He advocated for a third approach: ‚Äúintegration,‚Äù introducing materialist ideas to Christians while recommending theistic truths to the Communist Party. He argued that for Christians, the most important thing was to let go of pride, to ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù from the outside, and to be ‚Äútolerant‚Äù within.</p>
<p>In 1949, the North China Methodist Education Publishing Department published a series titled ‚ÄúMethodist LearningAs for the visiting delegations to South China (Hong Kong, Guangzhou) and North China (Beijing, Taiyuan, Xi‚Äôan, Xuzhou), they were scheduled to take place in February and April of 1950, respectively.</p>

<li>Diverging Opinions on the Withdrawal of Missionaries, 1941 (Chen Zhigang 2015: 128-133; Zhang Le 2020: 115-116; Anglican News 1941: 13-14)</li>
</ol>
<p>In June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France. By September, Japan, Germany, and Italy signed the Tripartite Pact in Berlin, officially joining the Axis powers. With Japan‚Äôs advancing military strategy, tensions between the U.S. and Japan escalated over the South Pacific, leading American expatriates in China to worry about the war‚Äôs threats. On October 6, the U.S. government officially announced an evacuation order for American citizens in the Far East, directing them to leave China (including Manchuria), Hong Kong, Japan, and French Indochina. Statistics showed that at the time, there were a total of 17,000 Americans in the Far East, of which 7,064 were in China. The majority of Americans were concentrated in Shanghai (4,000), Beiping (900), and Tianjin (700). This evacuation was primarily aimed at the 6,000-plus Americans in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Out of the more than 7,000 American expatriates, approximately 3,000 were missionaries. The U.S. State Department contacted the headquarters of various American churches, hoping they would help lead the evacuation. In December 1940 and January 1941, Secretary of State Cordell Hull discussed the issue twice with J. W. Decker, the chair of the Committee on East Asia from the Foreign Missions Conference of North America. During late 1940 and early 1941, most of those who evacuated were the families of missionaries and female missionaries, while the majority of male missionaries insisted on staying or withdrawing to the rear.</p>
<p>Within the missionary community, opinions on whether to withdraw varied. Those opposed to leaving believed they were fulfilling God‚Äôs command by engaging in mission work abroad and should follow God‚Äôs will rather than government orders. They were well aware of the teaching in 1 Peter 4 about ‚Äúsuffering with Christ.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow is a time to endure suffering; shouldn‚Äôt we demonstrate our faith? How can we be entirely governed by the government‚Äôs orders regarding our movements?‚Äù Furthermore, for nearly a century, missionaries had operated under government and treaty protections, and now was precisely the time ‚Äúto strive to break free from the constraints of a hundred years ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>In contrast, proponents of withdrawal argued that: (1) While missionaries were dedicated to Christ, they still had the responsibilities of being national citizens and obligations to obey the government. If a government order came from goodwill or aimed at maintaining peace and promoting justice, citizens should comply. (2) If a missionary‚Äôs activities were hindered, preventing them from fulfilling their original intent in service, shouldn‚Äôt they ‚Äútemporarily leave for the better‚Äù? Those who withdrew could also move to other ‚Äúareas with room for activity.‚Äù (3) In the event of war, citizens of the warring nations would likely be detained by the other side; to avoid unnecessary suffering, they should consider ‚Äútemporary departure as better.‚Äù (4) During warfare, being in a location would not only be unhelpful to missionaries but would also pose potential harm to the local church‚Äôs property and life. After missionaries left, ‚Äútheir lives, property, and such could be protected in other ways.‚Äù</p>
<p>Statistics show that from October 1940 to June 1941, the number of Protestant missionaries in China decreased from 2,805 to 2,162.</p>

<li>Different Considerations on Collaboration and Resistance in Occupied Areas, 1942 (Xing Fuzeng 2006: 136-174)</li>
</ol>
<p>After North China fell to Japanese forces, Japan clearly demanded that all denominational churches join the ‚ÄúNorth China Chinese Christian Union.‚Äù In October 1942, after the union‚Äôs establishment, Wang Mingdao of the Beijing Christian Church refused to participate. He held a completely negative attitude toward the union (and its predecessor, the ‚ÄúNorth China Christian United Promotion Association‚Äù). Wang‚Äôs refusal to participate was primarily based on two considerations: (1) The union was manipulated by ‚Äúgodless‚Äù Japanese soldiers and politicians, asserting, ‚ÄúThey aim to control the church and utilize it; thus, I cannot collaborate with them‚Äù; (2) The union was composed of ‚Äúfalse prophets‚Äù from the ‚Äúunbelieving camp.‚Äù These individuals ‚Äúlack faith and life; they are neither servants of God nor true Christians. God would never allow me to mix with them.‚Äù Grounded in the principle that ‚Äúbelievers and non-believers should not be unequally yoked,‚Äù Wang was determined not to join.</p>
<p>In Tianjin, union leader Huo Peixiu presented the considerations behind participating in the union as a ‚Äúveteran‚Äù in the field: ‚ÄúIn the climate of political pressure from the Japanese, there was a clear division among Chinese clergy: some leaned toward the Japanese, seeking new support, while others attempted to survive and temporarily cope, preserving the church‚Äôs strength for Britain and America.‚ÄùDue to the direct hostility between Japan and the Anglo-American nations, Chinese clergy felt compelled to bow to Japanese demands, expressing a willingness to establish the church union and even striving to become committee members and staff. This was not because they recognized the negative implications of Anglo-American control over the church and chose to dissolve the union, but rather they sought to preserve the essence of the union by forming the church organization in name, in order to cope with the current political landscape. This was my line of thinking at the time.</p>
<p>Scholars studying writers and intellectuals in Shanghai during the occupation noted that their responses to the Japanese military occupation could be categorized into three types: passivists, resisters, and collaborators. Many intellectuals (and ordinary citizens) in the occupied areas exhibited a certain degree of ‚Äúambiguity‚Äù politically; they were neither strictly ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù nor outright ‚Äútraitorous,‚Äù existing in a middle ‚Äúgray area.‚Äù If we were to break free from the moral binary of patriotic resistance versus treasonous collaboration to reconstruct the experience of the occupation, cooperating with the Japanese did not necessarily equal ‚Äúcollaborationism,‚Äù which refers to complete acceptance and endorsement of the ideology championed by the Japanese military. In the eyes of many, so-called ‚Äúcollaborators‚Äù maintained a relationship of both cooperation and struggle with the Japanese occupiers and the so-called ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù government. Viewed this way, a simplistic analysis of ‚Äúbetraying the nation for personal gain‚Äù or ‚Äúaiding the enemy‚Äù in recounting the history of the occupied areas clearly overlooks the complex mentalities and nuanced situations of those collaborating with the Japanese. While these collaborators were constrained by the Japanese and lacked an independent status, they also did not abandon their efforts to strive for greater autonomy.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the establishment of the North China Christian Union, while beneficial to Japan‚Äôs attempts to control religion, also represented an avenue for church leaders and believers (especially those from Anglo-American missionary backgrounds) to maintain and practice their religious faith. Due to the impact of war, the number of churches had certainly decreased significantly, and maintaining and leveraging the remaining religious influence was undoubtedly a challenge that churches in the occupied areas had to face. For the vast majority of the populace living in the occupied areas, the realities they had to confront and accept were not only the Japanese occupation but also how to collaborate with the Japanese. Unless loyalty to the nation was defined at the level of martyrdom, it was necessary to accept that living under occupation also represented a way of life, wherein the people had rights to live. All these matters could not simply be resolved through moral judgments.</p>

<li>‚ÄúNo One Has Ever Seen God,‚Äù 1943-1948 (Xing Fuzeng 2018: xxxii-xli)</li>
</ol>
<p>On August 6, 1943, Wu Yaozong completed a lengthy article entitled ‚ÄúNo One Has Ever Seen God,‚Äù which spanned 50,000 words and was published in the fourth issue of ‚ÄúChristian Quarterly.‚Äù It was reprinted later in Chengdu (third edition) in 1946 and in Shanghai (fourth edition). In 1948, he made some modifications based on various feedback, creating the fifth revised edition, which was subsequently reprinted in 1950 (sixth edition). Through this book, Wu explored the existence of faith in God and sought to reconcile the relationship between faith in God and materialism on a theoretical level, reflecting his intellectual response to the challenges posed by communism in the 1940s.</p>
<p>The title ‚ÄúNo One Has Ever Seen God‚Äù led many to mistakenly believe that it discussed the concept of God as depicted in the Gospel of John, particularly focusing on Jesus Christ. However, what Wu aimed to address was fundamentally the question of ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs existence.‚Äù ‚ÄúMany people doubt that God is invisible, yet what I want to point out is that: the invisible God is a truly existing God.‚Äù Wu was not simply proposing new arguments for traditional theological issues; he fundamentally aimed to establish a ‚Äúunique theory‚Äù by investigating the existence of God and addressing the relationship between faith in God and materialism.</p>
<p>First, he sought to construct a ‚Äúscientific view of God,‚Äù intending to demonstrate that ‚ÄúGod exists,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHis existence needs no proof.‚Äù God is merely a ‚Äúterm‚Äù used to represent complex phenomena, facts, and laws that objectively exist in the universe. ‚ÄúYou can deny the term ‚ÄòGod,‚Äô but you cannot deny the facts that this term represents.‚Äù Therefore, he argued that revolutionaries who do not believe in religion are fundamentally different from those who hold religious beliefs only in that they employ different frameworks (‚Äúdialectics‚Äù or ‚ÄúGod‚Äù) to confront the universe and existence. Revolutionaries believe that the success of their changes is inevitable because they perceive a historical necessity behind social transformations.‚ÄùOn the surface, this seems completely different from religious views, but in reality, both perspectives believe in a force within the universe that forges history according to certain laws, guiding human life.‚Äù As Wu pointed out in another article, ‚ÄúI have always believed that there is only one common truth in the world. This truth cannot be monopolized or patented by any particular doctrine or ideology, but can be discovered by anyone at any time.‚Äù In other words, belief in God or materialism represents different angles of discovering this ‚Äútruth.‚Äù</p>
<p>Under this framework of belief in God, Wu Yaozong proceeded to address the similarities and differences between Christianity and communism. He argued that materialism‚Äôs view of the objective world is ‚Äúhorizontal,‚Äù whereas the Christian perspective of God ‚Äúconnects the vertical and horizontal views.‚Äù From a philosophical standpoint, the ‚Äúvertical‚Äù refers to ‚Äúexistence‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing,‚Äù while the ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù pertains to ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù and ‚Äúphenomena.‚Äù He maintained that belief in God and materialism are not in conflict, as both acknowledge that all things in the universe objectively exist and can be experienced through scientific methods. However, he reiterated that ‚Äúbelief in God is not materialism because it adds an element to the materialistic worldview‚Äîan unification, emotionalization, and personification of the objective truth that pervades the cosmos, calling it God and viewing God as a guiding and supportive force in life.‚Äù</p>
<p>Wu Yaozong‚Äôs primary concern was not only to argue that the belief in God and materialism are not in conflict but also to further include materialism within the framework of his belief in God. As he expressed, ‚ÄúA person who believes in God can also believe in materialism.‚Äù He hoped that materialists could also accept the understanding of God that he articulated. Additionally, Wu‚Äôs explanation that materialism only views in a horizontal manner, while Christianity encompasses a vertical perspective, essentially reflected his aim to incorporate materialism into the belief in God. Although he did express criticisms of Christianity, he still valued and insisted on the unique contributions of Christianity in comparing the two. Of course, he understood that these positions ‚Äúwould seem absurdly heretical to both an orthodox materialist and an orthodox religious believer.‚Äù</p>
<p>After publishing ‚ÄúNo One Has Ever Seen God,‚Äù Wu Yaozong continued to explore this topic. In 1947, he submitted an article titled ‚ÄúChristianity and Materialism‚ÄîA Confession from a Christian‚Äù to the non-religious ‚ÄúUniversity Monthly.‚Äù The viewpoints in ‚ÄúChristianity and Materialism‚Äù largely inherited those from ‚ÄúNo One Has Ever Seen God.‚Äù In the conclusion of the article, he summarized, ‚ÄúChristianity and materialism each has its strengths and weaknesses. Christianity needs the strengths of materialism, and can also supplement its weaknesses. Similarly, materialism needs the strengths of Christianity and can complement its weaknesses.‚Äù</p>
<p>When the ‚ÄúUniversity Monthly‚Äù published Wu‚Äôs article, the editor added a note, stating that Wu adopted ‚Äúa metaphysical perspective, which does not scientifically address the essence of the problem but reflects a purely spiritual exploration and an idealistic state.‚Äù The entire text ‚Äúreflects a religious sentiment that transitions from anguish to comfort, a spiritual explanation that breathes with the times.‚Äù The editor described Wu as ‚Äúa devout, sincere, kind, and progressive elder‚Äù expressing everything from his heart, indicating the effort he made to ‚Äúharmonize truth.‚Äù However, the editor pointed out that ‚Äútruth is irreconcilable and does not need to be reconciled,‚Äù because materialism and religion do not share ‚Äúthe same worldview and truth perspective.‚Äù Both materialists and religious believers can be devoted to their beliefs, but the ‚Äústarting points of their truths are not aligned.‚Äù The former may accommodate materialism for the sake of spiritual comfort, while the latter needs to strive for progress in the material world (including human relationships) to feel justified. This commentary, while appreciating Wu Yaozong, inevitably revealed a strong parochial mindset, expressing significant reservations about Wu‚Äôs attempts at ‚Äúharmonization.‚Äù</p>
<p>In late January 1948, ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù published an article signed by ‚ÄúLi Quan,‚Äù titled ‚ÄúChristianity and Materialism‚ÄîAnother Christian‚Äôs View,‚Äù which raised questions regarding Wu‚Äôs perspective. Although Li Quan identified as a Christian and expressed some doubts and concerns from a Christian standpoint, the overall stance conveyed throughout the article was primarily from a materialist perspective.Li Quan argued that Wu Yaozong‚Äôs call for harmony was merely an unrealistic ‚Äúhope,‚Äù as it attempted to ‚Äúmodify‚Äù Christianity from a perspective that Christianity does not acknowledge, and likewise aimed to ‚Äúmodify‚Äù materialism from a viewpoint that materialism does not accept, leading to an outcome that ‚Äúabsolutely cannot succeed.‚Äù The issue primarily lies in the fact that ‚Äúfrom a fundamental philosophical standpoint, Christianity and materialism are absolutely irreconcilable; it is either you are right or I am right, and there is no notion of compensating one with the other‚Äôs strengths.‚Äù Li Quan‚Äôs argument effectively arose from a materialist standpoint, highlighting the fundamental conflict between communism and Christianity (methodological versus ontological), asserting a superior status for the former over the latter. He emphasized repeatedly that materialists cannot accept ‚Äúthe belief in God,‚Äù yet this does not hinder collaboration between materialists and Christians in social revolutionary endeavors. Materialists, considering the unified front, could unite with religious believers whose beliefs are fundamentally contradictory, agreeing to cooperate on a superficial level while recognizing that the deeper contradictions between the two sides are irreconcilable and should not be attempted to be reconciled.</p>
<p>In response to Li Quan‚Äôs perspective, Wu Yaozong published an article in ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù in February 1948. He acknowledged that, in the eyes of materialists, his belief in God appeared to be thoroughly ‚Äúidealistic.‚Äù However, he hoped materialists would realize that ‚Äúthis form of idealism has no fundamental conflict with materialism, as everything that materialism believes in, I can also accept; what I cannot accept is merely the denial involved in materialism.‚Äù Nevertheless, he expressed that the Christian ideas he presented, while ‚Äúnot completely aligned with materialism,‚Äù shared scientific validity; ‚Äúthe God I believe in is not a figment of imagination but one who is experienced through the objective truths and revelations of Jesus Christ.‚Äù Wu Yaozong believed he had at least alleviated the fundamental conflict between Christianity and communism, helping communists understand that while Christianity is not materialism, it can accept the truths found in materialism, and the idealistic components necessary within Christianity are not necessarily in conflict with materialism. For Wu, the ongoing question was not only about fundamentally resolving the contradictions between the two but also proposing that they could mutually complement each other.</p>

<li>The Two Directions of the Christian Student Movement (Zhang Lixia 2018: 67-69, 166-172; Zhao Zichen 1948: 3)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the establishment of the National Christian Students‚Äô Federation (Christians‚Äô Union) in 1945, the Christian student movement in China formed a rivalry between the Christians‚Äô Union and the National Christian Education League (1939, National Students‚Äô Union). The former focused on evangelism through the Movement of Christian Students, while the latter was concerned with social issues through the Students Christian Movement.</p>
<p>After the Christians‚Äô Union was established, it explicitly stated the need to prevent the liberal faction from undermining evangelism on campuses and expressed concerns about the spread of liberal theology. In late 1947, Jiang Wenhan, the director of the YMCA national committee, met with CIM missionary David Adeney, hoping to coordinate the two movements and avoid creating divisions among Christian students, while also exploring the possibilities for cooperation between them. However, Adeney believed that the two groups had fundamental differences in doctrine and atmosphere, making collaboration impossible. Adeney pointed out that the National Students‚Äô Union was relatively weak in biblical and spiritual matters, with a complex composition of non-Christian students participating, while the Christians‚Äô Union comprised ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù students with a common faith, making collaboration challenging. Jiang Wenhan had to admit that the difficulties in cooperation primarily lay within the Christians‚Äô Union, which often misunderstood the work of the Christian education movement and regarded the latter as having differing beliefs.</p>
<p>Zhao Zichen, the head of the School of Religion at Yenching University, commented on the two directions: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Chinese Christian college students either focus on political affairs at the expense of forgetting their faith or concentrate entirely on religion while overlooking the pressing issues of society, the state, and the world. Both of these biases are incorrect; one might be said to follow the tide, while the other is against it, the former lacking a solid position and foundation in faith, while the latter disconnects religion from human affairs, making individual lives unrelated to the greater society, ultimately leading them to a dead end. It is best for Christian students to care about national affairs, but neglecting a sincere pursuit along the religious path constitutes a grave mistake and significant drawback. Zealous members of the student movement should recognize the spiritual emptiness among today‚Äôs Chinese Christian students and ought to consider ways to remedy it.‚Äù He acknowledged that the Christian student movement in China indeed ‚Äúlacks profound religious strength.‚ÄùWhen student activists gather to discuss issues of social politics and economics as well as gender, they rarely focus on matters of Christian faith, doctrine, church, worship, and the life of the saints, leading to a complete disconnect between the student movement and the church. He argued that ‚Äúthe mistake does not lie in caring for national affairs, but in neglecting religion. Without concern for religion, the Christian student movement is naturally indistinguishable from the nationwide student movement and becomes an inconsequential appendage.‚Äù</p>

<li>The Two Open Letters from the National Christian Council of China, 1948 (National Christian Council of China 1948a, 1948b)</li>
</ol>
<p>In light of the changing situation, the National Christian Council of China published two letters to all believers in March and August 1948, aimed at encouraging them to face the challenges of the times. The first letter (March) noted that in this ‚Äúserious time of difficulty and crisis,‚Äù they hoped to offer encouragement in the love of the Lord, expressing the desire to ‚Äúseek and declare what God wishes to say.‚Äù After prayer, they, in the name of the Lord, urged fellow believers in the country to: (1) Strengthen their faith: affirm the authority of the Savior who governs history, saying, ‚ÄúDo not worry for the church! What we should fear is that we ourselves have not been faithful to the church‚Äù; (2) Bear witness for the Lord: witnessing for the Lord is the supreme right and duty of Christians. ‚ÄúWe believe that Christians may participate in politics as individuals, but the church cannot align itself with any political party.‚Äù The church is only to obey God; thus, while Christians engage in their civic duties and participate in politics, they must follow God‚Äôs guidance and will to demonstrate the spirit of Christ. In light of the current situation, they should focus their utmost efforts on the following two aspects: (a) Remind believers that in order to maintain the freedom to worship and serve God, it may require the sacrifice of their lives; (b) Any efforts that promote political and economic equality should be commended; (3) Seek the grace of the Lord: Acknowledge their sins, rely on the Lord‚Äôs grace, be vigilant in prayer, maintain a spirit of unity, and help each other.</p>
<p>In the second letter (August), the focus was on a question that had occupied the minds and consciences of many believers: ‚ÄúDoes Christianity have its own stance on current issues?‚Äù The Council pointed out that ‚Äúthe Christian church undoubtedly has its own stance,‚Äù and that stance ‚Äúis religious and not political,‚Äù meaning that the church cannot merge with any political party and should not utilize political power to fulfill its ideals. The church must maintain a spirit of fellowship that ‚Äúdoes not compromise with political developments.‚Äù The role of the church in society is to ‚Äúmanifest the conscience of Christians‚Äù and bear witness to God‚Äôs true salvation. The church‚Äôs religious stance is ‚Äútrans-political,‚Äù yet closely related to political actions. ‚ÄúIt has the responsibility to speak out and take action on the moral questions of national and international life.‚Äù This includes: (1) The church ‚Äúpermanently reminds the world that one cannot rely on oneself for salvation.‚Äù Political actions can never solve humanity‚Äôs fundamental spiritual problems. The kingdom of God cannot be conflated with a political utopia. ‚ÄúAlthough the church strives to assist in improving political systems, it does not wish to acknowledge any political system as absolute and without error‚Äù; (2) The church believes that true equality among humanity lies in the complete equality of every person in God‚Äôs love. ‚ÄúEvery individual has absolute value,‚Äù hence, ‚Äúhumans are the end, not the means,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe state exists for people, not the other way around.‚Äù Therefore, the church should protest against political actions that exploit human freedom and hinder human life, and it must resist ‚Äúany brutality that sacrifices individuals to preserve the interests of a particular class or party‚Äù; (3) If individual Christians are called to engage in political activities, ‚Äúwithout guidance from revelations based on religious faith, they possess no special political wisdom.‚Äù Other Christians should be willing to serve as ‚ÄúChristian citizens,‚Äù witnessing for their faith and lives in different professions. Christians should maintain fellowship and intercession among themselves, faithfully witnessing for the Lord.</p>

<li>The Stance of the General Conference of the China Christian Church on the Current Situation, 1948 (China Christian Church 1948)</li>
</ol>
<p>In December 1948, the General Conference of the China Christian Church expressed its stance on the current situation. The first part was ‚ÄúOur Beliefs‚Äù: (1) God created the world and humanity, granting individuals rights to freedom and equality; (2) A complete life must include spiritual cultivation; (3) The truth of Christ‚Äôs love is the highest example for humanity; (4) The realization of the kingdom of heaven does not depend on human methods, ideologies, or means; (5) The church serves as a gathering for believers to practice a Christ-centered life; (6) The world‚Äôs wars and violence will ultimately face God‚Äôs judgment.The second part of the statement was ‚ÄúOur Attitude‚Äù: (1) The church should not participate in any political party activities, ‚Äúshowing no favoritism,‚Äù but instead acting according to the truth‚Äî‚Äúsaying yes when it is yes, and saying no when it is no‚Äù; (2) When faced with misunderstandings or persecution, the church should engage in self-reflection and, if the fault lies within, correct it; if the fault lies with others, extend forgiveness. If possible, provide explanations; if ineffective, act according to one‚Äôs conscience, either withdrawing or staying temporarily, always seeking the benefit of the church. Do not lose heart; let God‚Äôs will be realized; (3) In the face of unreasonable harm, according to the Lord‚Äôs teachings, we should love our enemies and demonstrate great love in difficult times; (4) Rejoice in the Lord at all times, regardless of circumstances, and focus on preaching and serving all of humanity.</p>

<li>Does Jesus Have Hatred? (Wu Yaozong 1949: 133-136, 153-156)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1948, a debate arose in ‚ÄúTianfeng‚Äù regarding the question of ‚ÄúDoes Jesus have hatred?‚Äù Initially, Wu Yaozong mentioned in his January 1948 article ‚ÄúI Have Overcome the World‚ÄîLooking Ahead to 1948‚Äù that Jesus faced many ‚Äúfierce and cunning‚Äù enemies but did not regard them as significant. ‚ÄúTo them, Jesus had only hate.‚Äù Wu opposed the Christian argument that ‚Äúif Jesus could only have love and not hate,‚Äù citing Luke‚Äôs account of Jesus predicting the destruction of Jerusalem, noting that Jesus cried out in warning but was met with crucifixion. Jesus wept for His pitiful nation and ignorant people. What Wu referred to was, in fact, ‚Äúthe tragic replay of Jesus‚Äô time,‚Äù yet he still firmly believed that ‚Äútruth will ultimately triumph over the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>In response to Wu‚Äôs claim that ‚ÄúJesus had only hate,‚Äù Canadian United Church missionary Margaret H. Brown wrote to the editor of ‚ÄúTianfeng,‚Äù expressing her regret that ‚ÄúMr.&nbsp;Wu, such a passionate Christian, has so misunderstood Jesus‚Äôs attitude.‚Äù She emphasized that Jesus‚Äô command is ‚Äúto love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you‚Äù (Matthew 5:44) and argued that if ‚ÄúJesus only had hate,‚Äù then ‚Äúloving enemies‚Äù would become ‚Äúnonsense.‚Äù She pointed out, ‚ÄúJesus hates ‚Äòsin‚Äô but loves ‚Äòsinners,‚Äô loves ‚Äòenemies.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>In response to Brown‚Äôs criticism, Wu Yaozong acknowledged that years ago he had believed in ‚Äúexclusive love,‚Äù but he now realized that ‚ÄúChristianity often emphasizes advocating ‚Äòlove‚Äô in a positive way while treating ‚Äòhate‚Äô as a negative, destructive element.‚Äù He argued that ‚Äúcan ‚Äòsin‚Äô and ‚Äòsinner‚Äô be entirely separated? Jesus loves sinners, but He also hates sin; the two do not conflict.‚Äù If the two were separated, it would be easy to adopt an attitude of ‚Äúpalliating compromises‚Äù toward sin. Wu pointed out that ‚ÄúJesus embodies the ‚Äòreality‚Äô of hatred for sinners but loves the ‚Äòpotential‚Äô of sinners.‚Äù He further drew on the example of Gandhi, who actively opposed imperialism and racial hatred, rather than passively advocating love that condones evil and tolerates sinners.</p>
